namakaokapaoo_ch1_p6,1,6,"I ia wā, noke aku ana ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ka  huhuki ā pau kekahi māla ‘uala ā luna o kekahi  māla ‘uala, pēlā nō ka huhuki ‘ana ā pau nā māla  ‘elua ā kū ke āhua o ka lau o ka ‘uala, he kanahā  āhua ka nui o nā māla ‘elua. A laila, ho‘i a‘ela ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o a hō‘ā i ke ahi a ‘ōhinu akula ‘ehā  ‘au o ka ‘uala i luna o kapuahi e ‘ā ana. Iā ia e  ‘ōhinu ana i luna o ke ahi, ho‘i maila kona makua  kāne kōlea ā hiki, nīnau akula i kona makuahine, iā  Pōka‘ī: “‘A‘ole.” ‘Ī aku ‘o Puali‘i: “‘Ae, ‘o ke po‘o  ona a me nā maka ka mea e ‘īna‘i ai ku‘u ‘uala i  kēia lā, no laila, eia kona lā e make ai ia‘u.”","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",
