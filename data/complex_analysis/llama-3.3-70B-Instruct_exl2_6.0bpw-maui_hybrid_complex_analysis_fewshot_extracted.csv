namakaokapaoo_ch1_p1,1,1,"He keiki ‘u‘uku loa ‘o **a)** Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a he  keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio, ‘a‘ohe ona lua  ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau, i ka  ‘u‘uku a me ke koa loa. **b1)** ‘O Kauluakaha‘i, kona   makua kāne, **c)** no Kahikipapaialewa, he ‘āina i  Kahikinu‘u. **b2)** ‘O Pōka‘ī ka makuahine. **c)** He ali‘i  nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa, a **b1)** he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona.","Nāmakaokapāo'o was a very small child, and extremely strong when he was very young. There was no one like him from Hawai'i to Ni'ihau in terms of his small stature and bravery. His father was Kauluakaha'i, from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in Kahikinu'u. His mother was Pōka'ī. His father, Kauluakaha'i, was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa and also partly divine.","**Paragraph 1:** 
• It is characteristic of Hawaiian narrative openings to introduce: 
  – **a)** The name and sometimes age or physical attributes of the main protagonist, in this case, **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** (the eyes of the pāo'o fish), emphasizing his extraordinary strength and small size, signifying a potential for greatness despite his youth.
  – **b1)** The paternal figure, **Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i** (the inspiration of Kaha'i), indicating a connection to heroic lineage and knowledge. Kaha'i, as referenced, is a historical figure associated with bravery and the introduction of breadfruit, suggesting that Nāmakaokapāo'o's lineage is marked by courage and resourcefulness.
  – **c)** The geographical or spiritual origin, **Kahiki-papa ia-lewa** (Kahiki stratum in the sky), and **Kahiki-nu'u** (Kahiki at the summit), which are foreign lands or perhaps spiritual realms, hinting at Nāmakaokapāo'o's genealogical connection to distant or divine origins.
  – **b2)** The maternal figure, **Pō-ka-'ī** (night falls upon the high chief), whose name suggests an association with the mystical or nocturnal, possibly indicating a balance to the paternal, heroic lineage with a more mystical or celestial influence.
• The combination of these elements sets the stage for a story that may explore themes of identity, power, and the balance between human and divine influences, which are common in Hawaiian mythology and reflective of the complex societal structures during the 'Ai Kapu era.
• The mention of **Kahikipapaialewa** and **Kahikinu'u** as places of origin for **Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i** points to a narrative that might engage with concepts of foreign influence, spiritual realms, and the intersection of the mundane with the divine, themes that were particularly relevant during periods of cultural and societal change, such as the transition out of the 'Ai Kapu system.
• The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o's father is described as both a high chief and partly divine (**he 'ao'ao akua kekahi ona**) underscores the mythological context of the story, suggesting that Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions and destiny will be influenced by both mortal and divine forces, a common motif in Hawaiian stories where the protagonist's lineage and actions are deeply intertwined with the will of the gods and the balance of nature and society.
• The allegorical interpretation of Nāmakaokapāo'o's name, with **Nā-maka** potentially symbolizing wisdom, sight, or foresight, and **o-ka-pāo'o** referencing a fish known for its strength and perhaps the cyclical nature of life, suggests that the story may delve into themes of growth, transformation, and the balancing of opposites, echoing the broader philosophical and spiritual queries of Hawaiian tradition regarding the interconnectedness of all things and the pursuit of balance and harmony.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","The chapter presents the story of Nāmakaokapāo'o, a young child of extraordinary strength and bravery, who embodies the major themes of identity, power, and the struggle for dominance. Born to a high chief father, Kauluakaha'i, and a mother, Pōka'ī, Nāmakaokapāo'o's life is marked by his conception in 'Ewa, his birth, and his growth into a powerful individual.

Historically and culturally, the narrative is set in ancient Hawaii, where chiefs and ali'i held significant power and influence. The story reflects the cultural values of the time, including the importance of ohana (family), the role of chiefs, and the concept of mana (power and spiritual energy). The character of Nāmakaokapāo'o represents the cultural ideal of a strong and brave leader, who is feared and respected by his peers.

The chapter's significance in Hawaiian literature lies in its representation of the struggles and triumphs of a young hero, who navigates the complexities of power, identity, and family dynamics. Through Nāmakaokapāo'o's story, the narrative explores the tensions between tradition and innovation, as well as the consequences of challenging established authority.

The cohesive narrative of the chapter can be synthesized as follows: Nāmakaokapāo'o, a young child of remarkable strength, is born to a high chief father and a mother, Pōka'ī. As he grows up, he becomes increasingly powerful and bold, ultimately leading to a confrontation with his stepfather, Puali'i, who seeks to dominate and control him. Nāmakaokapāo'o's prayer, which invokes the power of his ancestors and the natural world, proves to be a decisive factor in his victory over Puali'i.

The subsequent events, including Nāmakaokapāo'o's hiding in the cave of Waipouli, his confrontation with the warriors sent by 'Ama'u, and his eventual triumph over 'Ama'u himself, demonstrate his growing power and influence. Ultimately, Nāmakaokapāo'o's story serves as a testament to the enduring power of Hawaiian cultural values, including the importance of ohana, mana, and the struggle for dominance.

The chapter's themes and significance can be further understood through the analysis of individual passages, which provide insights into the character development, plot progression, and cultural context of the narrative. For example, Paragraph 1 introduces Nāmakaokapāo'o as a young child of extraordinary strength, while Paragraph 6 highlights his bravery and cunning in the face of adversity. Paragraph 10, which describes Nāmakaokapāo'o's return to his mother, Pōka'ī, after killing Puali'i, underscores the importance of ohana and the complex relationships between family members.

Overall, the chapter provides a rich and nuanced exploration of Hawaiian culture, history, and literature, offering a unique perspective on the themes and significance of Nāmakaokapāo'o's story. The narrative serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring importance of Hawaiian cultural values, including the struggle for dominance, the power of ohana, and the significance of mana."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o  Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","Nāmakaokapāo'o was conceived in 'Ewa, where Hō'ae'ae is the land. There, they had intimate relations and subsequently, Nāmakaokapāo'o was born. Pōka'ī gave birth to Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then Kauluakaha'i returned to his land. Pōka'ī stayed with her child, Nāmakaokapāo'o, and later gave birth. In this birth, Pōka'ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo'o were very affectionate.","**Paragraph 2:** 
• This paragraph delves into the conception and birth of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, focusing on the relationships between the main characters: 
  – Hō-'ae'ae (the presence of 'ae'ae, a type of seaweed or a decorative border, possibly symbolizing a connection to the ocean or a decorative, spiritual realm): the land in 'Ewa, on the island of O'ahu, where the intimate encounter between Pō-ka-'ī and Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i took place, resulting in the conception of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o.
  – Pō-ka-'ī (night falls upon the high chief): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's mother, who gives birth to him and is described as being very affectionate with her child.
  – Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i (the inspiration of Kaha'i): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's father, a high chief from Kahiki-papa ia-lewa, who returns to his land after the conception, leaving Pō-ka-'ī to care for their child.
• The description of Pō-ka-'ī as being very affectionate (ʻilihune loa) with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may symbolize the strong bond between mother and child, which could be essential for Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's development and future actions.
• The fact that Kauluakaha'i returns to his land after the conception may indicate a separation between the physical and spiritual worlds, with Kauluakaha'i representing a connection to the divine or the foreign lands of Kahiki.
• The 'Ai Kapu era, a time of strict rules and regulations governing the lives of Hawaiians, may have influenced the way this story is told, with the focus on the relationships between characters and the land, rather than on the actions of the characters themselves. This could be seen as a way of subtlely critiquing the 'Ai Kapu system, which was known for its rigidity and emphasis on social hierarchy.
• The use of the name Hō-'ae'ae as the location of the conception may hold allegorical meaning, as 'ae'ae can also refer to a type of spiritual border or decoration. This could symbolize the blurring of spiritual and physical boundaries, and the connection between the earthly and divine realms.
• The birth of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o in 'Ewa, a region on the island of O'ahu, may also hold significance, as 'Ewa is known for its fertile land and abundant resources. This could represent the idea of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o being a symbol of growth, abundance, and new life, which could be fitting for a story that may be allegorically related to the transition away from the 'Ai Kapu era and towards a more progressive time.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puali‘i saw Pōka‘ī and desired her, saying: “I desire you as my woman.” Pōka‘ī replied: “Why do you desire me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is weary.” Puali‘i said: “Those things are nothing, if you desire me, we will sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed. And Pōka‘ī returned with her husband and Puali‘i to the plains of Keahumoa, to live.","**Paragraph 3:** 
• This paragraph introduces a new character, Pua-li‘i (Pua-li‘i: the assembly of chiefs or a chief's gathering), who is described as a kanaka maika‘i (good man) from Lī-hu‘e (sheltered calm or peaceful refuge). 
– The term kanaka maika‘i highlights Pua-li‘i's positive character traits, which may imply a sense of respectability, kindness, or fairness, all of which are highly valued in Hawaiian culture.
• Puali‘i is engaged in the activity of lawai‘a (fishing), specifically in the kai (sea) of Hono-uli-uli (calm or peaceful bay), which may symbolize a sense of tranquility or peacefulness. 
– The bay of Hono-uli-uli could be an actual location, but it may also represent a symbolic or metaphorical space, perhaps indicating a place of refuge or safety.
• Puali‘i visits the hale (house) of Pō-ka-‘ī (perhaps 'night falls upon the high chief'), where he sees and desires her, expressing his desire to make her his wahine (woman). 
– The name Pō-ka-‘ī may imply a connection to the night or the spiritual realm, and her character may represent a feminine or receptive principle.
• Pōka‘ī responds by mentioning her past experience of giving birth to a child (ke keiki, referring to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o) and her current state of physical weariness (‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino). 
– This exchange may allude to the cultural significance of childbirth and the physical and emotional challenges associated with it, particularly during the 'Ai Kapu era, where women's roles and responsibilities were strictly defined.
• Puali‘i dismisses Pōka‘ī's concerns, stating that these factors are of no importance (hea mea ‘ole) if she desires him, and they can moe kāua (sleep together). 
– This statement may symbolize the desire for intimacy, connection, or union, which could have deeper allegorical meanings in the context of Hawaiian mythology and cultural practices.
• Pōka‘ī agrees to Puali‘i's proposal, and they return to the kula (plains) of Ke-ahumoa (the misty or foggy upland), where they will live together. 
– The name Ke-ahumoa may represent a place of transition, ambiguity, or transformation, which could be significant in the context of the story, particularly in relation to the characters' personal growth, relationships, or the broader cultural and historical context.
• The events in this paragraph may be seen as a reflection of the social and cultural norms of the time, including the 'Ai Kapu era's strict rules and regulations regarding relationships, marriage, and family. 
– The story may be using these events to comment on or critique certain aspects of Hawaiian society during this period, such as the restrictions on women's roles and the emphasis on social hierarchy and status.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

When the sweet potatoes were mature, Puali'i spoke his wish, ""When the head of the ulua fish is cooked with sweet potatoes, then Puali'i will eat, and afterwards, his wife, Pōka'ī, and the others will eat."" Therefore, Puali'i went down to the sea of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:** 
• The narrative continues with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o settling down and engaging in farming activities, specifically cultivating sweet potatoes ('uala) in two large fields (māla 'uala lōʻihi) that are said to still exist today. 
– The fact that these fields are named after him (ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o) suggests a strong connection between Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and the land, as well as his significant impact on the community.
• Puali'i's statement regarding the cooking of ulua fish with sweet potatoes is noteworthy: 
– The use of ulua (a type of fish) in this context may allude to its cultural significance, particularly in the 'Ai Kapu era, where ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice due to its name's homophony with the word for ""to grow"" or ""to increase.""
– The phrase ""Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala"" implies a ritual or ceremonial act, possibly symbolizing the transition from a period of scarcity to one of abundance, with the ulua and sweet potatoes representing the connection between the sea and the land, or the divine and the mundane.
• The structure of Puali'i's statement, ""then Puali'i will eat, and afterwards, his wife, Pōka'ī, and the others will eat,"" reflects the hierarchical nature of 'Ai Kapu society, where the ali'i (chief) eats first, followed by others of lower rank.
– This hierarchical structure is also evident in the allocation of food resources, with Puali'i, as the chief, having priority access to the food, and Pōka'ī, his wife, eating afterwards, highlighting the societal norms of the time.
• Puali'i's decision to go fishing in the sea of Honouliuli to accompany the sweet potatoes with fish may symbolize the balance between the mahina 'ai (farming and cultivation) and the mahina kalai (fishing and seafood gathering), reflecting the dual economy of ancient Hawaiian society.
– The choice of location, Honouliuli, may hold cultural or historical significance, potentially relating to the story's themes of abundance, fertility, or the connection between the land and the sea.
• The name Pō-ka-‘ī (Puali'i's wife) may be interpreted as ""night falls upon the high chief,"" suggesting a connection to the spiritual or mystical realm, and potentially signifying her role as a mediator between the divine and the mundane.
– The etymology of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's name, with Nā-maka- referring to ""the eyes"" and o-ka-pāo'o potentially alluding to the pāo'o fish, may be seen as symbolic of his role as a bridge between different realms or dimensions, with the eyes representing insight, wisdom, or the ability to see beyond the ordinary.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o's body was very small, about two fistfuls with a half, and his sickness was not improving, he was very weak. When they arrived at the sweet potato field, that child instructed the children, “Pull up the sweet potato vines with the leaves, completely removing them from the top, do not leave any to grow.” However, that child was stubborn, so he just sat quietly in the sweet potato field, not pulling up the vines.","**Paragraph 5:** 
• The narrative reveals an interesting situation where Pua-li‘i (Pua-li‘i: a high chief, with -Pua- referring to a chief or a flower, and -li‘i- referring to a chief or royalty) is engaged in fishing (lawai‘a), a common practice in ancient Hawaiian society, while Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish) is accompanying a group of children to Pua-li‘i's sweet potato fields (māla ‘uala).
– The number of children mentioned, ‘umi kumamāhiku (twenty), may have symbolic meaning, potentially representing a complete cycle or a full count, which could be related to the life cycle of the sweet potato plant or the cyclical nature of time in Hawaiian culture.
• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o's physical condition is described as having a body (kino) that is very small (‘u‘uku loa), measuring about two fistfuls (‘elua kapua‘i) with a half (ka hapa), and his sickness (ma‘i) is not improving, leaving him weak (lewalewa).
– The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o's physical condition may symbolize his spiritual or emotional state, potentially highlighting the struggles he faces in his journey or the challenges of navigating the complexities of the ‘Ai Kapu era.
• Upon arriving at the sweet potato field, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o instructs the children to pull up the sweet potato vines (huhuki i ka pu‘e) with the leaves (me ka lau ‘uala), completely removing them from the top (ā pau loa i luna), and not leaving any to grow (mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana).
– This instruction can be seen as an allegory for the disruption of traditional practices or the abandonment of outdated customs, potentially symbolizing the beginning of a new era or the introduction of new ideas.
– The sweet potato (‘uala) was a staple crop in ancient Hawaiian society, and its cultivation held significant cultural and spiritual importance, making this scene potentially representative of the struggle between tradition and progress.
• However, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o himself does not follow his own instructions, instead choosing to sit quietly (kāohi mālie) in the sweet potato field, refusing to pull up the vines (‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e).
– This act of defiance may symbolize Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o's own resistance to the traditional practices of the ‘Ai Kapu era, potentially foreshadowing his role in bringing about change or challenging the existing social order.
– The contrast between Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o's instructions to the children and his own actions may also represent the complexity of his character, highlighting the internal conflicts or contradictions that he faces in his journey.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then, Nāmakaokapāoʻo returned and lit a fire and burned forty sweet potatoes on top of a kapuahi oven that was burning. As he was burning them on top of the fire, his father, a Cassandra-like prophet, arrived, and asked his mother, Pōkaʻī: ""Not so?"" Pualiʻi replied: ""Yes, his head and eyes are the things that my sweet potatoes will be eaten with today, and so, this is the day that he will die.""","**Paragraph 6:** 
• This passage continues to illustrate the destructive nature of **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo** (the eyes of the pāoʻo fish), who is still a child but exhibits behavior that is far from childish: 
  – He destroys two entire sweet potato patches, leaving only the tops of the leaves, which are likened to the appearance of a **kanahā** bird, a metaphor that might allude to the destructive consequences of his actions, and the great number of patches destroyed emphasizes the severity of his destructive behavior.
  – The use of **kanahā**, a bird known for itsattachment to the land and its role in Hawaiian mythology, might imply that the destruction caused by **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo** has repercussions that affect the land and the community.
• The number forty, mentioned in the context of burning sweet potatoes, is a significant number in Hawaiian culture, often associated with completion, abundance, and spiritual growth: 
  – In this context, the burning of forty sweet potatoes might symbolize the destruction of abundance and the disregard for spiritual growth, underscoring **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo**'s reckless behavior.
  – The act of burning sweet potatoes can also be seen as a form of desecration, given the importance of sweet potatoes as a staple crop in Hawaiian culture, particularly during the 'Ai Kapu era, when the cultivation and distribution of food were heavily regulated by religious and social norms.
• The dialogue between **Pōkaʻī** (perhaps 'night falls upon the high chief') and **Pualiʻi** (a name that might be associated with the sweet potato, **ʻuala**, and the concept of growth or increase) reveals the tension and conflict within the family: 
  – **Pualiʻi**'s threat to eat **Nāmakaokapāoʻo**'s head and eyes with sweet potatoes is a stark and violent image, which might be interpreted as a symbolic expression of the consequences of **Nāmakaokapāoʻo**'s actions, rather than a literal threat.
  – The mention of head and eyes as the means to eat sweet potatoes alludes to the Hawaiian cultural practice of using the head and eyes of the **ulua** fish as a substitute for human sacrifice, highlighting the idea that **Nāmakaokapāoʻo**'s behavior is seen as a form of sacrilegious destruction, worthy of punishment.
• The character of **Nāmakaokapāoʻo** can be seen as an allegory for the forces of change and progress, which are often at odds with traditional practices and norms: 
  – His destructive behavior might symbolize the dismantling of the 'Ai Kapu system, which was characterized by strict rules and regulations governing the cultivation, distribution, and consumption of food.
  – The conflict between **Nāmakaokapāoʻo** and **Pualiʻi** might represent the tension between the old and the new, with **Nāmakaokapāoʻo** embodying the spirit of change and **Pualiʻi** representing the adherence to traditional norms and practices.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw this and ran and stood in a row to watch Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Here is the club in my hand, it will strike your head today, and your head will be cut off, and then it will be cooked with sweet potatoes, and I will eat it first, and then it will be freed.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not listen to Puali‘i's words, and Puali‘i spoke again, this time in anger. Puali‘i was ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the club, at the time when Nāmakaokapāo‘o was praying his death prayer for Puali‘i. The prayer was as follows: 
Love only the eyes of my pāo‘o fish,
Swollen and rough is the surface,
Maybe eaten, maybe left,
Maybe left to Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,
That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,
My pāo‘o fish eyes are for my lover,
Nāmakaokai‘a is the high chief of Hawai‘i,
Go away, go away, only the humble ones,
The people with the spear,
The spear with the drum,
Die to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","**Paragraph 7:**
• The events in this paragraph unfold rapidly, showcasing the intense animosity between Puali‘i and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, amid a backdrop of power struggle and generational conflict, characteristic of the 'Ai Kapu era.
– Puali‘i, driven by anger, takes the club (ko‘ilipi), an object often associated with strength, authority, and warfare, and approaches Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, who is engaged in a mundane yet crucial activity – cooking sweet potatoes, a staple food in Hawaiian culture, symbolizing nourishment and sustenance.
• The mention of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o cooking four sweet potato tubers is intriguing, as it might allude to the four cardinal directions or the four primary stages of life in Hawaiian cosmology, signifying a connection to the land, the divine, and the cyclical nature of life.
– The act of cooking, especially sweet potatoes, holds spiritual significance, as it represents transformation and growth, mirroring the themes of personal and societal evolution that permeate this narrative.
• Puali‘i's threat to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, involving the club, decapitation, and the consumption of his head with sweet potatoes, is a stark, violent image that conjures the specter of human sacrifice, a practice associated with the 'Ai Kapu period, highlighting the deep-seated cultural and generational conflicts at play.
– This threat can also be seen as an allegory for the struggle between the old, rigid 'Ai Kapu system and the emerging, more progressive societal norms, with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o representing change and Puali‘i embodying the resistance to it.
• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o's prayer, directed at Puali‘i, is laden with symbolic language and metaphorical references, showcasing the complex spiritual and cultural tapestry of ancient Hawaiian society.
– The invocation of the pāo‘o fish eyes as a symbol of love and the reference to Nākukui‘aimakaokalani, a figure possibly associated with divine or ancestral lineage, underscore the deep connection between the individual, the land, and the divine in Hawaiian belief systems.
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o itself, with Nā-maka- (the eyes) -o- (of) -ka- (the) -pāo‘o (a type of fish), may symbolize clarity, foresight, or the ability to navigate through challenging situations, reflecting the protagonist's role as a harbinger of change.
• The prayer's conclusion, with its wish for the death of Puali‘i, marks a turning point in their conflict, symbolizing the inevitable clash between the forces of tradition and those of innovation, setting the stage for the events that will unfold in the narrative.
– The mention of Nāmakaokai‘a as the high chief of Hawai‘i introduces the theme of leadership and the rightful governance of the land, hinting at the broader political and societal transformations that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o's story may allegorically represent.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Now let's briefly discuss those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, they were both high chiefs of Hawai‘i, Nāmakaokalani was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the child, but they were both included in the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","**Paragraph 8:** 
• The narrative shifts to introduce two new characters, Nā-maka-o-ka-lani and Nā-maka-o-kai-‘a, both high chiefs (ali‘i nui) of Hawai‘i, highlighting their relationship as father and child.
– The names Nā-maka-o-ka-lani and Nā-maka-o-kai-‘a are significant, as they both share the Nā-maka-o- prefix, which can be broken down into: Nā (the) - maka (eyes) - o (of), suggesting a connection to the concept of vision, insight, or perspective.
– Nā-maka-o-ka-lani can be further analyzed as: ka-lani (the sky or heaven), implying a celestial or spiritual connection. This could symbolize a higher level of understanding or a strong spiritual foundation, characteristic of high chiefs during the 'Ai Kapu era who often claimed divine ancestry.
– Nā-maka-o-kai-‘a breaks down into: ka-i-‘a (of the sea or related to the sea), which might represent a connection to the ocean, fertility, or the provision of food, as the sea was a primary source of sustenance in ancient Hawaiian society.
• The inclusion of these characters in the prayer of Nā-makaokapāo‘o suggests a broader narrative scope that may involve themes of lineage, spiritual power, and the balance between celestial and earthly (or spiritual and physical) domains.
– The fact that Nāmakaokalani is the father and Nāmakaokai‘a is the child may allegorically represent the passing down of knowledge, power, or spiritual insight from one generation to the next, a crucial aspect of Hawaiian cultural and religious practices.
– The mention of these high chiefs and their relationship to Nāmakaokapāo‘o's prayer could also allude to the complexities of the 'Ai Kapu system, where social hierarchy, religious practices, and familial lineage were intricately connected. The narrative may be setting the stage for exploring these themes in the context of progressive thinking versus traditional 'Ai Kapu customs, similar to the interpretations surrounding Nāmakaokapāo‘o's actions and character in previous paragraphs.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Puali‘i's head was presented to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Aloha to you, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” Immediately, Nāmakaokapāo‘o grabbed Puali‘i's head and threw it into the sea of Waipouli, a cave on the shore of Honouliuli, its length being five miles.","**Paragraph 9:** 
• This paragraph represents a pivotal moment in the narrative, as it showcases the confrontation between Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and Pua-li'i, with the former emerging victorious. The act of Pua-li'i swinging his adze (ko'ili) down onto Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's back, only to have it turn around and strike him, can be seen as a symbolic representation of the ineffectiveness of traditional methods in the face of change.
– The name Pua-li'i can be broken down into Pua (flower, child, or offspring) and li'i (small, insignificant, or royal), which might suggest that Pua-li'i represents arotating or outdated aspect of traditional Hawaiian society, one that is no longer effective or relevant in the face of progressive thinking, as embodied by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o.
• The image of Puali'i's head being presented to Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the greeting ""Aloha 'oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" (Aloha to you, Nāmakaokapāo‘o) serves as a stark contrast to the violence that preceded it, highlighting the complexities and nuances of Hawaiian cultural practices, particularly during the 'Ai Kapu era, where violence and spirituality coexisted.
– The act of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o grabbing Puali'i's head and throwing it into the sea of Waipouli, a cave on the shore of Honouliuli, can be seen as an allegory for the rejection of outdated traditions and the embracing of new ideas and perspectives. The fact that the cave is five miles long may symbolize the journey or path that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is undertaking, one that requires the abandonment of traditional practices and the adoption of new, progressive ways of thinking.
• The use of the name Waipouli (dark or black water) for the sea where Puali'i's head is thrown may hold cultural significance, as it could represent the unknown, the unconscious, or the underworld, further emphasizing the themes of transformation and change that are present throughout the narrative.
– The location of Honouliuli, with its historical and cultural significance, adds another layer of depth to the narrative, as it may serve as a reference point for the stories and legends that are deeply rooted in Hawaiian tradition and history, particularly those related to the 'Ai Kapu era and the eventual overthrow of the traditional kapu system.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

There is a strong and powerful little child, whose father has died and whose head was cast into the deep ocean, a very long distance, five miles. If ‘Ama‘u had heard of this and came to me, I would have died at his hands, but since I did not die, he has no power over me.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words being spoken in Waikīkī.","This paragraph marks a shift in the narrative, as Nāmakaokapāo‘o returns to his mother Pōka‘ī after Puali‘i's death, and the attention turns to ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, and a conversation that takes place in Waikīkī.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found.
