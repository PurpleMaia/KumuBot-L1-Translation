Pōka'ī was his mother. His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part god.","**Paragraph 1:**
• The passage introduces the main protagonist, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish), described as a small but incredibly strong boy with no equal from Hawai'i to Ni'ihau in terms of his physical attributes and bravery. 
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is broken down into its components: Nā-maka (the eyes) and pāo'o (a type of fish), likely used poetically to refer to the head or a part of the body.
• The passage also introduces Nāmakaokapāo'o's parents: 
– His father is Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i (the inspiration of Kaha'i), a name that references Kaha'i, a hero known for traveling to Samoa and bringing back breadfruit to Hawai'i. This name likely alludes to the character's connection to legendary figures and events.
– His mother is Pō-ka-'ī, a name that may be interpreted as ""night falls upon the high chief"" or have other esoteric meanings.
• The geographical locations mentioned, Kahiki-papa-ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign country) and Kahiki-nu'u (Kahiki at the summit, a foreign country), are significant as they are associated with Kauluakaha'i and indicate a connection to external, possibly legendary or spiritual realms.
• The description of Kauluakaha'i as a high chief (ali'i nui) of Kahikipapaialewa and being ""part god"" ('ao'ao akua) suggests that Nāmakaokapāo'o comes from a lineage with divine or semi-divine connections, which is a common trait among chiefly lines in Hawaiian culture and history, particularly during the 'Ai Kapu era.
• The introduction of Nāmakaokapāo'o and his lineage may allegorically represent themes related to strength, leadership, and the blending of human and divine elements, which are significant in Hawaiian cultural narratives and historical accounts.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","Chapter 1 of the story of Nāmakaokapāo'o presents a complex narrative that weaves together themes of strength, power, and cultural identity. At its core, the story introduces Nāmakaokapāo'o, a young boy of extraordinary strength and bravery, who navigates a world of challenges and conflicts that ultimately lead to his rise as a conqueror of O'ahu.

The narrative is rich in allegorical meanings, with Nāmakaokapāo'o embodying the heroic archetype. His character is contrasted with other figures, such as Puali'i and 'Ama'u, who represent opposing forces that Nāmakaokapāo'o overcomes. The story also explores the theme of familial relationships, with Nāmakaokapāo'o's interactions with his mother, Pōka'ī, and his stepfather, Puali'i, highlighting the complexities of family dynamics.

Historically and culturally, the story is set against the backdrop of ancient Hawai'i, with references to specific locations, such as 'Ewa, Līhu'e, and Waikīkī, grounding the narrative in a particular time and place. The text also alludes to the 'Ai Kapu era, a period of Hawaiian history characterized by a strict system of rules and taboos. The story's portrayal of Nāmakaokapāo'o's strength and bravery can be seen as a reflection of the cultural values of ancient Hawai'i, where physical prowess and martial skills were highly valued.

The chapter's significance in Hawaiian literature and cultural analysis lies in its representation of the heroic narrative, a common trope in Hawaiian storytelling. The story of Nāmakaokapāo'o offers insights into the cultural and historical context of Hawai'i, highlighting the importance of understanding the complex interplay between cultural identity, power dynamics, and historical context.

Upon closer examination, the narrative reveals a nuanced exploration of power and identity. Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions, particularly his destruction of the sweet potato patches and his killing of Puali'i and 'Ama'u, demonstrate his extraordinary strength and bravery. However, these actions also raise questions about the nature of power and its relationship to identity. The story suggests that Nāmakaokapāo'o's strength is not only a physical attribute but also a manifestation of his cultural identity and his connection to his heritage.

The temporal context of the story is also noteworthy. The narrative was first published in the late 19th century, a period marked by significant cultural and political upheaval in Hawai'i. The story's themes of strength, power, and identity may have resonated with a Hawaiian audience experiencing the challenges of colonialism and cultural suppression. Furthermore, the story's portrayal of Nāmakaokapāo'o as a heroic figure may have been influenced by the political climate of the time, with the narrative serving as a form of cultural resistance or a celebration of Hawaiian identity.

The story's use of place names and cultural references adds another layer of depth to the narrative. The sweet potato patches, 'Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o,' in Keahumoa, 'Ewa, serve as a tangible connection to the land and the cultural practices associated with it. The narrative also highlights the importance of oral tradition and the passing down of cultural knowledge through storytelling.

In synthesizing the insights from individual passages, it becomes clear that the story of Nāmakaokapāo'o is a complex and multifaceted narrative that resists simplistic interpretation. The chapter offers a nuanced exploration of cultural identity, power dynamics, and historical context, making it a significant contribution to Hawaiian literature and cultural analysis.

Ultimately, the story of Nāmakaokapāo'o presents a rich and complex narrative that rewards close reading and analysis. By examining the themes, allegorical meanings, and cultural references within the text, scholars can gain a deeper understanding of the historical and cultural context of Hawai'i and the significance of this story within the broader landscape of Hawaiian literature."

When Pōka‘ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, and Pōka‘ī remained with her pregnancy, and later, she gave birth. During this time of giving birth, Pōka‘ī and her child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, were extremely poor.","**Paragraph 2:** 
• The paragraph continues the story of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, focusing on the events surrounding his conception and birth; 
• The name Hō‘ae‘ae (to agree or to assent repeatedly) is associated with a place in ‘Ewa, indicating the location where Pō-ka-'ī and Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i had physical relations and conceived Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. The toponym Hō‘ae‘ae may be interpreted as a place of agreement or acceptance, potentially signifying the mutual consent between the two individuals;
– The use of 'Ewa as the broader geographical context is significant, as 'Ewa is a region on O'ahu known for its historical and cultural importance;
• The phrase ""ma laila lāua i launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho"" indicates a consensual and intimate encounter between Pō-ka-'ī and Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i, highlighting the cultural context of relationships and conception;
• After conceiving Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i returns to his land, leaving Pō-ka-'ī to carry the pregnancy to term and give birth. This abandonment or separation may symbolize the challenges faced by single parents or the changing dynamics of relationships in ancient Hawaiian society;
• The narrative highlights the extreme poverty (""he ‘ilihune loa"") experienced by Pō-ka-'ī and her child, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, during this period. The term ‘ilihune (extreme poverty) is noteworthy as it indicates a state of being very poor, destitute, or lacking the basic necessities. This could be an allegorical representation of the struggles faced by many during certain periods in Hawaiian history or a specific narrative device to illustrate the challenges overcome by the protagonist;
– The poverty experienced by Pō-ka-'ī and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may also reflect the societal issues related to the 'Ai Kapu era and its eventual decline, as stories of demigods and chiefs often intertwined with the social and economic realities of the time;
• The etymology of the names continues to offer insights into the characters and their destinies: Pō-ka-'ī (night falls upon the high chief) and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish), with the latter's name potentially signifying insight, perception, or a specific ancestral or spiritual connection. The name Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i (the inspiration of Kaha'i) suggests a connection to the legendary figure Kaha'i, known for his voyages and the introduction of breadfruit to Hawai'i, potentially imbuing Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o with a heroic or significant lineage.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

He paid a visit to the home of Pōka‘ī. Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and liked her. He said, ""I'd like you to be my woman."" Pōka‘ī replied, ""How could you possibly want me? I've given birth to a child and my body is ruined."" Puali‘i said, ""I don't care about that. If you like me, let's sleep together."" Pōka‘ī agreed and she went with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**
• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu'e (cold water, a place in 'Ewa, O'ahu, likely referring to the area now known as Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay, referring to a bay in 'Ewa, O'ahu), somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-'ī was living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. 
– In the 'Ai Kapu era, it was customary for people to walk on land to every destination, and it was normal to call in at the house of strangers and ask for food and water. Receiving strangers at one's home and providing them with food and water was considered a generous act, and refusing such requests was deemed rude. This custom is recounted in many Hawaiian stories and is likely the reason Pua-li'i called in at Pōka'ī's house and why Pōka'ī received Pua-li'i in her home, where he observed how she was living.
• Pua-li'i falls in love with Pō-ka-'ī and proposes a long-term relationship. Pō-ka-'ī expresses hesitation due to a negative self-image, citing her having given birth to a child and her body being 'ino'ino (damaged, spoiled, or ruined), likely referring to the changes in her physical appearance after childbirth. 
– The term 'ino'ino may also carry connotations related to her spiritual or ritual purity, as childbirth was considered a time of ritual impurity in 'Ai Kapu culture. Pua-li'i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, they should begin a long-term relationship and acknowledge each other as kāne (boyfriend, husband, long-term lover) and wahine (girlfriend, wife, long-term lover).
• The couple relocates to Ke-ahu-moa (the altar or heap of chickens, likely a metaphorical or poetic name for a place), in Līhu'e (Wāhiāwā), where Pua-li'i is from, to live. 
– The relocation to Ke-ahu-moa may signify a new beginning or a change in their lives, possibly symbolizing a transition from one social or ritual status to another. The name Ke-ahu-moa may also have esoteric or allegorical meaning related to the couple's new life together.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water.

Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

There were two long sweet potato patches that are still there to this day, and the name given to these patches is Nāmakaokapāo‘o to this day. When the sweet potatoes were mature, Puali‘i spoke his vow, saying, ""When the head of the ulua fish and sweet potatoes are cooked, Puali‘i will eat, and then it will be free [from kapu], and his woman, Pōka‘ī, and others will eat. So, Puali‘i went down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for a fish to eat with the sweet potatoes.","• The passage describes Puali'i and Pōka'ī settling into their life together, with Puali'i working the land and having two long sweet potato patches; • The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is given to the two sweet potato patches, likely due to the story of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, Pōka'ī's son from a previous relationship, and his destructive behavior described in previous paragraphs. The name is a reference to the eyes (nā maka) of the pāo'o fish, which is a poetic way of referring to the head (po'o). This name etymology suggests a deep connection between the land, the people, and their stories;
– The use of the name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o for the sweet potato patches implies that the land is tied to the narrative of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and his family, highlighting the importance of storytelling in Hawaiian culture and the connection between people and the 'āina (land);
• Puali'i makes a vow (ʻōlelo hoʻohiki) regarding the cooking and eating of the ulua fish and sweet potatoes, indicating that the consumption of these foods is tied to a specific ritual or cultural practice. In the 'Ai Kapu era, certain foods were kapu (forbidden) until they were properly consecrated or until certain rituals were performed;
– The mention of cooking the head (po'o) of the ulua fish with sweet potatoes is significant, as it references the ulua fish being used as a substitute for human sacrifice in 'Ai Kapu culture. The head of the ulua fish represents the symbolic substitution for human sacrifice, highlighting the cultural significance of this practice;
• The act of Puali'i going fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to catch a fish to eat with the sweet potatoes suggests that the couple is preparing for a meal that is significant in their cultural context. The fact that Puali'i goes fishing after making his vow implies that the meal is a crucial aspect of their cultural practice;
– The passage highlights the importance of food and its preparation in Hawaiian culture, particularly in relation to the 'Ai Kapu era. The kapu system governed many aspects of Hawaiian life, including the consumption of food. The fact that Puali'i and Pōka'ī will eat together after the food is consecrated or made noa (free from kapu) underscores the significance of shared meals in Hawaiian culture.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo'o's body at that time was very small, two and a half feet tall, and his navel was not fully healed, it was still hanging loose. When they reached the sweet potato patch, he told the children, ""Tear out all the sweet potato tubers and leaves, don't leave any to grow."" However, the children were afraid, so they just gently handled the sweet potatoes, not pulling out the tubers.","**Paragraph 5:**
• The story progresses with Pua-li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line) going out to fish, leaving Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) and seventeen other children at his sweet potato patch; 
– The number seventeen (umi kumamāhiku: ten and seven) may have cultural or esoteric significance. In some Hawaiian stories, specific numbers hold symbolic meaning, so it's possible that seventeen represents a particular concept or theme;
• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is described as being very small in stature, at two and a half feet tall, and still having an unhealed navel, indicating he is likely still a toddler or very young child. This emphasizes his youth and vulnerability;
• Upon reaching the sweet potato patch, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o instructs the other children to completely destroy the patch by pulling out both the tubers and the leaves, leaving nothing to regrow. This act can be seen as destructive and may symbolize a disruption or challenge to the existing order or practices, possibly related to the 'Ai Kapu era's emphasis on agriculture and food production;
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, with 'Nā-maka' (the eyes) potentially symbolizing insight, understanding, or a connection to the maka (sweet potato vine cuttings used for replanting), and 'pāo'o' (a poetic or metaphorical reference to 'po'o', the head), may be allegorically linked to the act of destroying the sweet potato patch. The 'eyes' could represent the potential for regrowth or the 'seed' for future crops, while 'pāo'o'/'po'o' might signify the source or origin;
• The other children are afraid to follow Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's instructions, choosing instead to gently handle the sweet potatoes without pulling out the tubers. This hesitation may indicate a recognition of the wrongdoing or a fear of the consequences of such an action, possibly reflecting the cultural values of responsibility and stewardship associated with agricultural practices during the 'Ai Kapu era;
• The act of destroying the sweet potato patch and the reaction of the other children could be seen as a narrative device to explore themes related to obedience, authority, and the consequences of one's actions within the context of Hawaiian cultural practices and traditions.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

He tore apart both sweet potato patches until there was a pile of sweet potato leaves, forty piles from the two patches. Then Nāmakaokapāo'o returned and lit a fire to broil four sweet potato vines on a burning fire pit. As he was broiling them on the fire, his stepfather returned and arrived, and asked his mother, Pōka'ī, who said, ""No."" Puali'i said, ""Yes, his head and eyes are what will accompany my sweet potatoes today, so today is the day he will die by my hand.""","**Paragraph 6:**
• The actions described in this paragraph are symbolic and likely carry deeper meanings related to the cultural context and the characters involved. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, a young boy, is engaging in destructive behavior by tearing apart the sweet potato patches. 
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) is significant. 'Maka' can refer to eyes, and 'pāo'o' may be a poetic or metaphorical reference to 'po'o' (head), suggesting a connection between the name and the body parts mentioned later in the passage (head and eyes).
• The numbers mentioned (2, 4, 40) are noteworthy and may represent a riddle or have esoteric significance, potentially tied to the cultural or spiritual practices of the time. 
– The destruction of the two sweet potato patches resulting in forty piles could symbolize abundance or a significant event. 
– The broiling of four sweet potato vines may be related to the number's significance in Hawaiian culture or ritual practices.
• Puali'i's reaction to Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions is one of extreme anger, culminating in a threat to kill him and use his head and eyes as accompaniments to his sweet potatoes. 
– This threat is particularly significant given the cultural context. In the 'Ai Kapu era, certain practices and taboos governed the consumption of food and the treatment of human bodies. 
– The mention of eating someone's head and eyes with sweet potatoes is a reversal or subversion of normal practices and may indicate Puali'i's adherence to or nostalgia for the 'Ai Kapu customs, or it may symbolize a deeper conflict or allegorical meaning.
• The head (po'o) and eyes (nā maka) are symbolically significant in Hawaiian culture, potentially representing leadership, insight, or the continuation of life (in the case of 'maka' relating to the sprouting or 'eyes' of plants like sweet potatoes).
– The reference to using Nāmakaokapāo'o's head and eyes with sweet potatoes, instead of ulua fish (a known substitute for human sacrifice in 'Ai Kapu practices), suggests a complex layering of cultural references and potential allegory for the abandonment or critique of 'Ai Kapu practices.
• The conflict between Nāmakaokapāo'o and Puali'i may symbolize a generational or ideological clash, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing a more progressive or disruptive force, and Puali'i embodying a more traditional or conservative viewpoint.
– This dynamic is further complicated by Puali'i being Nāmakaokapāo'o's stepfather, indicating a familial or societal tension that is being played out through their interactions.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw him and ran to stand at a distance, fearing Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o, ""Hey! Here's the cutting knife in my hand, it's to cut off your head today, and when your head is severed, we'll bake it with sweet potatoes, and I'll eat it first, and then it'll be free (from kapu)."" Nāmakaokapāo'o didn't listen to Puali'i's words, and then Puali'i spoke again, a second time. Puali'i was ready to cut Nāmakaokapāo'o with the knife when Nāmakaokapāo'o prayed his death prayer for Puali'i. The prayer went like this: 
""Aloha, the eye of my pāo'o fish,
Gathering, assembling here,
To eat perhaps, or perhaps to leave,
Perhaps Nākukui‘aimakaokalani will leave it,
That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,
This is my aikāne companion,
Nāmakaokai‘a, the high chief of Hawai'i,
Slipping away, the foolish one slips away,
People with spears,
Spear with shield,
Death to Nāmakaokapāo'o.","• **Paragraph 7:** The confrontation between Pua-li'i and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o escalates as Pua-li'i approaches Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o with a cutting knife (ko'i lipi), intending to kill him. The other children present flee in fear, highlighting the fearsome reputation or presence of Pua-li'i. 
– The use of the cutting knife is significant as it is a tool associated with manual labor and, in this context, with violence. Pua-li'i's intention to behead Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and bake the head with sweet potatoes is a grave threat, symbolizing the ultimate form of dominance or control.
• The speech by Pua-li'i to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o includes a threat not just to kill him but to consume his head with sweet potatoes, mirroring the 'Ai Kapu practice of sacrificing humans and offering them to the gods, but here it is twisted as Pua-li'i intends to eat Nā-maka-okapāo'o's head himself. This act, if carried out, would be a desecration in the context of 'Ai Kapu beliefs.
– The response of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is to pray a death prayer (pule make) for Puali'i instead of reacting with violence or compliance. This prayer is significant as it contains references that are both poetic and esoteric.
• The prayer recited by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is a form of spiritual counterattack. Breaking down the names and terms used in the prayer:
– **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o**: (The eyes of the pāo'o fish), a name that might symbolize insight or the ability to see beyond the surface level.
– **Nā-kuku-i‘aima-ka-o-kalani** and **Kukui‘aimaokaokalani**: These names seem to be related to the concept of light (kukui means light or candle nut) and possibly refer to celestial or divine entities or concepts. 
– **Nā-maka-okai‘a**: (The eyes of the sea or possibly a personal name related to the sea) is referred to as the high chief (ali'i nui) of Hawai'i, suggesting a connection to high-ranking chiefs or divine beings associated with Hawai'i.
– The prayer seems to call upon various spiritual entities or concepts to act against Puali'i, using imagery that might be interpreted as calling for chaos or disorder (""Slipping away, the foolish one slips away, People with spears, Spear with shield""). 
• The overall tone and content of the prayer suggest a rich layer of cultural and spiritual references, underscoring the complexity of Hawaiian spiritual practices and the significance of names and epithets in these contexts.
• The act of praying a death prayer for Puali'i can be seen as Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o employing spiritual or supernatural means to counter the physical threat posed by Puali'i, reflecting the belief in the power of prayer and spiritual forces in Hawaiian culture during this period.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Then he spoke from elsewhere. Puali'i's severed head replied to Nāmakaokapāo'o, ""Farewell, Nāmakaokapāo'o."" Nāmakaokapāo'o grasped Puali'i's head and threw it into the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the shoreline of Honouliuli; its length was five miles.","**Paragraph 9:**• The narrative reaches a climactic moment where Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is saved from being killed by Pua-li'i through his quick thinking and supernatural or exceptional strength. The act of turning the adze (ko'i lipi) against Pua-li'i signifies Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's resourcefulness and possible divine or demigod intervention, as his father, Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i, is described as part god; • The use of the adze (ko'i) is significant as it was a tool used in various contexts, including woodworking and, symbolically, in the 'Ai Kapu era, possibly representing a tool of the gods or a symbol of chiefly power. The fact that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is able to turn it against Pua-li'i may symbolize his alignment with or control over certain powerful forces or practices; – The severed head of Pua-li'i speaking to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o suggests a level of supernatural or spiritual continuity, as in some Hawaiian stories, severed heads or body parts can retain consciousness or the ability to communicate. This could be interpreted as Pua-li'i acknowledging Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's power or accepting his fate; • The name Pua-li'i (Pua-li'i) can be broken down into ""pua"" meaning child or offspring and ""li'i"" meaning chief or royalty, indicating Pua-li'i's status or aspirations. His beheading and the disposal of his head may symbolize the end of an era or a significant change in the dynamics between characters; • The disposal of Pua-li'i's head into the sea at Wai-pouli (water of Pouli; Pouli can mean dark or night), a cave (ana) on the shoreline of Hono-uliuli (dark bay), is symbolic. The sea and caves often represent the boundary between the world of the living and the dead or the spiritual realm in Hawaiian culture. The act may signify Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's rejection of Pua-li'i's influence or the removal of a potential threat; – The specific location, Hono-uliuli, is in 'Ewa, O'ahu, and is associated with fishing and possibly spiritual or ritual practices. The distance of 'elima (five) miles to the cave may hold numerical significance or be used to emphasize the extent or the impressiveness of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's action; • The narrative's details, such as the beheading and the disposal of the head, could be analyzed for their allegorical meaning, potentially relating to themes of power struggle, the transition from one cultural or societal practice to another (e.g., the decline of 'Ai Kapu practices), or the establishment of a new order. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's actions may be seen as symbolic of a break with the past or the embracing of a new path, potentially reflecting historical or cultural transitions in Hawaiian society.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

'Ama'u heard this and thought, ""If I can get his strength when I kill him, but if I don't kill him, he has no strength.""

– The name 'A-ma'u (fearless; or trembling) is introduced as an ali'i (chief) of O'ahu, residing at Wai-kīkī (spouting fresh water), a well-known location on O'ahu. 
• A man from Hono-uliuli (dark bay), likely a place with cultural or geographical significance related to the story's setting, arrives at Wai-kīkī and shares news about Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o with 'A-ma'u, highlighting Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's remarkable strength and the circumstances surrounding his father's death. The detail about Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's father's head being carried five miles out to sea is significant and may carry symbolic or literal meaning related to the story's themes or historical context.
– The number five might be symbolic or represent a specific measure or distance significant in the narrative or Hawaiian culture.
• 'A-ma'u's reaction to the news indicates his interest in Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's strength and his consideration of killing him to acquire that strength, showing the chief's pragmatic or perhaps ruthless nature. This reflects the complex dynamics and power struggles within the 'Ai Kapu era or the narrative's cultural context.
– The fact that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o overhears 'A-ma'u's words suggests his proximity or the open nature of the conversation, potentially setting the stage for a confrontation or further developments in the story.
• The introduction of 'A-ma'u and his interest in Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o adds a new layer to the narrative, exploring themes of power, strength, and the dynamics between chiefs and individuals within the story's cultural and historical framework.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",

This act can be seen as a metaphor for exposing or revealing something, possibly related to the tensions within the household or the state of their relationships; • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o then lies down in the middle on top of the roof. This action could symbolize a position of power or control, as he is literally on top of the house. It may also signify a state of vigilance or watchfulness, as if he is guarding or overseeing the surroundings; • The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, and the actions associated with him, may be allegorically connected to the themes of insight, protection, and the challenging of existing social or familial norms. The etymology of his name, with 'nā maka' referring to 'the eyes' and 'pāo'o' likely being a poetic or alternate form of 'po'o' (head), suggests a connection to perception, awareness, or the symbolic 'head' or leadership. – In the context of the 'Ai Kapu era, such actions and the use of specific terms may carry additional layers of meaning related to the cultural and religious practices of the time, including the potential subversion or critique of these practices through the narrative.","Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there.

They said, ""We've come to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who's incredibly strong and brave, and who killed his father, Puali'i.""","**Paragraph 12:**
• The narrative introduces a new character, 'Ama'u (curled up/contracted) ke ali'i (the chief), from Waikīkī (spouting fresh water), who sends four war parties (po'e kaua) to capture or fight Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o; 
– The number of men in each party is specified as 48 (kanahā kumamāwalu), a number that may have cultural significance and potential esoteric meaning. The total number of men sent by 'Ama'u is 192 (4 x 48), which could be an allegorical or metaphorical representation;
• The war parties arrive at the plains of Ke-ahu-moa (the heap of chickens) in Līhu'e, where they enter a house, likely Puali'i and Pōka'ī's residence, but find it empty. As they prepare to leave, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o calls out from the roof (kaupoku), and although they hear his voice, they can't see him;
– This event showcases Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's cunning and strength, as he is able to evade detection and confront the war parties;
• The men ask Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o where he is, and he responds that he is ""i luna nei"" (up here), prompting eight men to climb up to capture or fight him. The fact that they need to climb up to reach him suggests that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is in a position of power or has an advantage;
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its components: nā maka (the eyes) and pāo'o (a poetic or metaphorical reference to po'o, meaning head). This name may be symbolic, referencing the idea of insight, awareness, or the ability to see beyond the surface level;
• When the men confront Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, he asks them what brings them to the area. They respond that they have come to fight him because he killed his father, Puali'i, a claim that may be related to the events described in previous paragraphs;
– This confrontation highlights the tension and conflict between Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and the war parties sent by 'Ama'u, potentially reflecting the cultural and societal tensions during the 'Ai Kapu era or other historical periods in Hawaiian history;
• The narrative may be allegorically representing a conflict between different values, practices, or worldviews, with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o embodying a particular perspective or set of values that are in opposition to those represented by 'Ama'u and the war parties.","Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, ""Where is that voice coming from?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I'm up here."" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""What in the world are you all doing here?""

He was the one who ran and reached 'Ama'u at Waikīkī and told him about the death of all of them, and he was the sole survivor to report the news to 'Ama'u.","• **Paragraph 13:** The narrative reaches a climactic moment where Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) engages in a life-or-death battle with a group of people who have come to kill him; 
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is analyzed as Nā-maka-o-ka-pā'o'o, with ""Nā-maka"" (the eyes) likely symbolizing insight, awareness, or the capacity to perceive, and ""pā'o'o"" (pāo'o) being a poetic or alternate form of ""po'o"" (head), potentially signifying leadership or prominence. The name may thus signify someone with great perception or foresight who is a leader or of high status.
• The dialogue between Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and his adversaries reveals a complex interplay of identity and threat. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o attempts to deflect the attack by suggesting he is merely a namesake, implying there is another Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o in Ko'olau (the windward side), potentially referring to a different person or a symbolic or spiritual entity; 
– The threat made by the group against Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is based on hearsay or prior information (""pela ko makou lohe"" - that's what we heard), indicating a premeditated intent to kill him, highlighting the danger and tension in the situation.
• The narrative showcases Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's exceptional strength and martial prowess as he defeats his adversaries, a feat that aligns with his characterization as incredibly strong in the opening paragraphs; 
– The survival of one individual who escapes to Waikīkī to inform 'Ama'u about the outcome of the battle serves to advance the plot and potentially introduce new conflicts or tensions, as news of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's actions spreads.
• The toponym Waikīkī, the location where the sole survivor reaches 'Ama'u, is significant as it refers to a specific place on O'ahu known for its springs or fresh water sources. The name 'Ama'u, potentially derived from the 'ama'u fern, may symbolize strength, resilience, or transformation, depending on the cultural significance attributed to the 'ama'u fern in Hawaiian tradition.
• This episode can be interpreted allegorically as a representation of the struggle between different factions or ideologies within the narrative's cultural context, possibly reflecting historical or societal conflicts related to the 'Ai Kapu era or other significant periods in Hawaiian history. The victory of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may symbolize the triumph of a particular viewpoint or the advent of a new era, with the defeated group representing an opposing force or outdated practices.","Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him."" The soldiers said, ""No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive."" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""Well, let's go down and fight."" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

When 'Ama'u and his people arrived in 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o was busy destroying everything, leaving no one alive, and 'Ama'u was killed. O'ahu was then completely conquered by Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then he went to fetch his mother and placed her in a position of authority over the land of O'ahu.","**Paragraph 14:** 
• This paragraph continues the narrative of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) conquests, shifting the focus to his conflict with 'Ama'u, a chief from a different region. 'A-ma'u (the ma'u (fern) or (tremble)), is the name of a fern native to Hawai'i, likely used here as a metaphor or a poetic reference to the character's nature or actions. The number of war canoes, 'umi-kuma-māwalu (18), is specific and might hold symbolic meaning or significance in the context of the narrative. 
– The preparation of eighteen war canoes indicates 'Ama'u's readiness for battle and highlights the scale of the conflict between 'Ama'u and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o.
• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's destruction is described as thorough, leaving no one alive in 'Ewa, demonstrating his incredible strength and martial prowess. 'Ama'u's defeat signifies Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's superiority in battle.
• After 'Ama'u's death, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is said to have conquered O'ahu completely (puni), indicating his dominance over the island. The term ""puni"" implies a comprehensive victory or control.
• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o then retrieves his mother, Pō-ka-'ī, and installs her in a position of authority (ho'onoho) over O'ahu. This act suggests that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o values his mother's influence and possibly seeks to legitimize his rule through her. It also indicates a level of respect or devotion towards his mother, as well as potentially transferring some of his power to her.
– The act of placing Pō-ka-'ī in authority could be seen as a gesture of consolidation of power and an attempt to stabilize the region under his control by having a figure he trusts in a position of leadership. This action may also reflect the cultural significance of maternal lineage and the role of women in Hawaiian chiefly societies.","When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
