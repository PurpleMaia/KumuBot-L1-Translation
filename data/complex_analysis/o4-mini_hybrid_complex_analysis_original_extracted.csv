His father was Kauluakaha‘i of Kahikipapaialewa—a land in Kahikinu‘u.  
His mother was Pōka‘i.  
His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa and possessed a divine aspect.","1. Overview of the Passage  
This opening paragraph serves as a concise genealogical and heroic introduction to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, situating him both in space (the islands from Hawaiʻi to Niʻihau) and in lineage (son of Kauluakaha‘i and Pōka‘i). In Hawaiian mo‘olelo (traditional narratives), such openings announce a protagonist’s noble birth, remarkable attributes, and place in the sacred geography of the islands.

2. Linguistic Features  
– Predicate-first structure: Hawaiian often begins with a predicate. “He keiki ‘u‘uku loa ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o” literally “A child very small [is] Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” The particle ‘o marks the proper noun.  
– Intensifier loa: The word loa (“very,” “extremely”) amplifies qualities. It occurs twice here, modifying ‘u‘uku (“small”) and koa (“warrior, brave”).  
– Relative ‘a‘ohe…ma kēia mau mokupuni: “there was none…in these islands.” The construction ‘a‘ohe (there is none) + locative ma + this plural possessed by “mau mokupuni” (islands) yields a sweeping claim of uniqueness.  
– Possessives and kinship: “kona makua kāne” and “ka makuahine” employ the simplex possessive kona (“his/her own”), typical of close kin.  
– The copula ‘o in “‘O Kauluakaha‘i” introduces a noun phrase as subject.  
– Repetition of clauses b1), b2), c): These markers (introduced in the original text for analysis) highlight parallel genealogical statements, reinforcing lineage from both father and mother.

3. Cultural Context  
– Genealogies (mo‘okū‘auhau): Central to chiefly status (ali‘i). By naming both parents and their lands, the text establishes Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s high rank and inherited mana.  
– Spatial scope (Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau): By spanning the inhabited leeward isles, the narrative claims supremacy across a large political and cultural landscape.  
– The term ‘ōpiopio: Often rendered “youth” or “adolescent,” this term can connote a stage of emerging strength and prowess. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s combination of small stature and great warrior ability exemplifies an idealized youthful hero.  
– Land names: Kahikipapaialewa and Kahikinu‘u are archaic or mythic place-names. Linking chiefs to specific ‘āina (land units) underscores the reciprocal bond between ali‘i and land, each conferring identity and authority on the other.  
– Divine aspect (‘ao‘ao akua): Claiming that Kauluakaha‘i had an “aoao akua” (literally “a side/phase of god”) places the father in the realm of beings who bridge human and divine, a common motif in Hawaiian origin and heroic tales.

4. Historical Significance  
– Preservation of rank and rights: Prior to Western contact, genealogies were memorized and chanted to legitimize land claims, chiefly succession, and social order.  
– Oral to written transition: Texts like this one represent efforts in the 19th century (by Hawaiian-language newspapers and missionaries) to record mo‘olelo that had previously existed only in chant and oral recitation.  
– Reflection of sociopolitical structure: References to “ali‘i nui” (high chief) and divine descent mirror the stratified, theocratic society of pre-contact Hawai‘i, where political power was intertwined with spiritual authority.  
– Myth-history interface: Figures such as Nāmakaokapāo‘o often straddle the line between human ancestor and demigod; their deeds and genealogies anchor local traditions in a pan-Hawaiian legendary landscape.

In sum, this passage efficiently establishes the hero’s exceptional nature—his unusual combination of small size and warrior prowess—while embedding him in a framework of high chiefly rank, sacred lands, and divine ancestry. Linguistically and culturally, it exemplifies the ways in which Hawaiian narrative gives form to identity, power, and place.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","Chapter 1 introduces Nāmakaokapāoʻo, a diminutive child born of the high chief Kauluakaha‘i of Kahikipapaialewa and his consort Pōka‘i, whose low rank contrasts with her child’s divine potency. From his conception in the ʻEwa district to the legends that grow around his name, the passages trace his origins, trials, and ascent to rulership of Oʻahu.  

Major Themes  
- Genealogy and Divine Descent:  Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s mixed noble and lowborn heritage highlights the Hawaiian emphasis on bloodlines and the belief that chiefly mana can transcend human limitations.  
- Strength, Vengeance, and Justice:  Though physically small and once ailing, Nāmakaokapāoʻo exhibits supernatural bravery—overcoming his stepfather Pualiʻi’s murderous plot, invoking a death pule, and defeating multiple war parties.  
- Kapu, Ritual, and Word‐Power:  The narrative underscores the power of the ʻōlelo hoʻohiki (solemn vow) and pule (prayer), the inviolability of ritual commands, and the consequences of violating divine or social prohibitions.  
- Land, Agriculture, and Authority:  The sweet potato gardens of Keahumoa serve as both the setting of treachery and the markers of ancestral claims, linking cultivation with chiefly sovereignty.  

Historical and Cultural Context  
This chapter reflects the 19th-century effort to record native moʻolelo—stories that weave history, genealogy, and myth. References to ʻEwa, Wai­pouli, Līhuʻe, and Waikīkī situate the tale in the Oʻahu landscape. The role of ʻAmaʻu, the use of war canoes, the structure of extended households, and the invocation of high chiefs such as Nāmakaokalani illustrate pre-contact and early-contact social order, warfare protocol, and the sacramental significance of names.

Significance in Hawaiian Literature  
As an opening chapter, it establishes narrative motifs that recur throughout Hawaiian epic traditions: a miraculous birth, the triumph of an underdog, word as weapon, and the hero’s right to rule. It preserves genealogical memory, legitimizes dynastic authority, and affirms cultural values—honor, reciprocity, and the intertwining of humans and ʻāina.

Cohesive Narrative Synthesis  
We follow Nāmakaokapāoʻo from vulnerable infancy through Pōka‘i’s remarriage to the treacherous Pualiʻi, whose ʻōlelo hoʻohiki over roasted sweet potatoes precipitates a life-and-death confrontation. Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s prayer unwinds supernatural protection, his slaying of Pualiʻi echoes justice, and his defense against ʻAmaʻu’s war parties signals his destiny. By chapter’s end, he secures Oʻahu for himself and installs his mother as aliʻi, uniting personal vengeance, ritual power, and martial prowess in a founding saga that underpins later chronicles of island history."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o  Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","The land of Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa was the place where the two of them lay together, joining in intimacy and sleeping until Nāmakaokapāo‘o was conceived.  Then Pōka‘i carried Nāmakaokapāo‘o in her womb.  Kauluakaha‘i indeed returned to his own land, while Pōka‘i remained throughout her pregnancy and afterward gave birth.  At that birth, both Pōka‘i and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were of very low rank.","1. Cultural and Historical Context  
– Hō‘ae‘ae and ‘Ewa: ‘Ewa is one of the ancient moku (districts) on O‘ahu, on the leeward (west) side of the island.  Hō‘ae‘ae designates a subdivision of ‘Ewa, itself a fertile area known for its kula (dryland agriculture) and anchialine ponds.  By locating the birth of Nāmakaokapāo‘o in Hō‘ae‘ae, the text ties this genealogy to a specific landholding, an essential element in Hawaiian chiefly lines.  
– Genealogical importance: This paragraph is part of a mo‘okū‘auhau (genealogical account) that traces ancestral connections through birth, marriage, and rank.  The low status of both mother and child at this birth reveals how rank could shift dramatically if a chief neglected family obligations.  
– Concepts of rank: The term ‘ilihune (here rendered “very low rank”) literally means “slave” or “bondservant.”  Rank in traditional Hawai‘i was determined by birth, chiefly favor, and marriage alliances.  A chief’s failure to acknowledge or support offspring could strip both mother and child of high status.

2. Key Hawaiian Terms and Linguistic Features  
– ‘launa kino’ (“joining of bodies”) and ‘moe’ana’ (“sleeping together”): Both are idiomatic terms for sexual union, more graphic than the euphemistic ‘ho‘omo‘e’.  Their pairing underscores that this was a private, intimate act rather than a formal marriage ceremony.  
– ‘loa‘a’: “to be obtained; to come into existence; to conceive.”  In genealogical texts, loa‘a often marks the moment a child is conceived or “brought into being” in the mother’s womb.  
– ‘hāpai’: “to be pregnant; to carry in the womb; to bear.”  Grammatically, hāpai ‘o Pōka‘i iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o uses the actor–object marker iā to show that Pōka‘i is the one who carries (hāpai) the child named Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  
– ‘noho ihola’: “to remain until it is completed.”  Ihola intensifies noho (“to remain, dwell”), here indicating that Pōka‘i stayed in one place for the full duration of her pregnancy.  
– Aspect markers: ho‘i akula (‘indeed returned’), ihola (perfective nuance), and ma hope (‘afterward’) are all fine examples of how Hawaiian narrative makes temporal and aspectual relations explicit without separate past/future tense markers.

3. Narrative Structure and Implications  
– The paragraph follows a tight sequence: place → union → conception → migration → gestation → birth → rank assessment.  This mirrors many genealogical passages, which are less concerned with emotional detail than with locating births in space and rank.  
– Kauluakaha‘i’s departure (“ho‘i akula…i kona ‘āina”) is crucial.  By returning to his land, he abandons both the pregnant Pōka‘i and the unborn child.  In Hawaiian custom, acknowledgment by the father (through residence, gifts, or ceremony) could uphold a child’s status.  His absence here foreshadows the low rank ascribed at the birth.  
– The closing sentence explicitly ties the status of mother and child to this event: Ma kēia hānau‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘i a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  Such blunt statements about rank are typical in mo‘okū‘auhau and serve to warn or explain why a given line did not inherit chiefly rights.

4. Broader Significance  
– Land and lineage: This small episode illustrates the deep connection between genealogy and land tenure in pre-contact Hawai‘i.  A child’s place in the land hierarchy depended not only on noble blood but also on the social recognition and ongoing ties to ancestral territories.  
– Gender and power: Pōka‘i’s experience shows the vulnerability of women and children when paternal support was withdrawn.  Yet the very recording of this birth preserves Pōka‘i’s link to the genealogy, suggesting that even low-rank lines were valued in the oral-written tradition for their role in the full tapestry of ali‘i (chiefly) descent.  
– Language preservation: Passages like this, dense with archaic terms and grammatical structures, highlight the importance of careful linguistic analysis when working with chants, genealogies, and mele.  Understanding words such as ‘launa kino,’ ‘hāpai,’ and ‘ilihune’ in context prevents oversimplification and honors the original record-keepers’ precision.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p3,1,3,"Iā lāua e noho ana, iho maila ‘o Puali‘i, he  kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e, i ka lawai‘a ma kai o  Honouliuli, kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka‘ī.

A ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘ī me kāna kāne me  Puali‘i ā ke kula o Keahumoa, noho.","While the two of them were living together, down came Puali‘i—an excellent man from Līhu‘e, who had been fishing offshore at Honouliuli—and he visited at Pōka‘ī’s house.  Puali‘i gazed upon Pōka‘ī and found her desirable, and said: “I want you to be my wife.”  Pōka‘ī replied: “How can you desire me?  I have borne a child, and my body is no longer attractive.”  Puali‘i answered her: “Those things mean nothing; if you wish me, let us lie together.”  Pōka‘ī agreed.  And so Pōka‘ī returned with her husband and with Puali‘i to the plain of Keahumoa, where they dwelt.","1. Cultural Context  
   - This passage illustrates flexible marital and sexual mores in traditional Hawaiian society, where a woman—though already married—may accept the advances of another man of good reputation (“he kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e”) without social stigma.  The fact that Pōka‘ī returns to live with both her husband and Puali‘i suggests a form of consensual polygyny/concubinage rather than strict monogamy.  
   - Childbearing and postpartum norms appear in Pōka‘ī’s objection—“Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino.”  She is concerned her body, having borne a child, is “ʻinoʻino” (rough, unattractive, or disagreeable).  This remark highlights cultural attention to physical condition in the context of sexual desirability and reproductive status.  
   - Place-names anchor the narrative in real geography: Līhu‘e (on Kaua‘i), Honouliuli (a coastal area on O‘ahu), and the plain (kula) of Keahumoa.  Puali‘i’s journey “iho maila” (down thither) from Līhu‘e to Honouliuli and then inland to Keahumoa signals the ease of inter-district and even inter-island travel by canoe in pre-contact times.

2. Linguistic Features  
   - Aspect and directionals: “e noho ana” (imperfective continuous “while they were living”), “iho maila” (directional “down hither”), “kipa maila” (visitative with recent past nuance). The particle “maila” situates the action relative to the speaker’s vantage.  
   - Direct speech and reporting: The construction “‘ōlelo akula ia: ‘Makemake au iā ‘oe…’” uses the perfective “–akula” to mark completed action, and the third-person pronoun “ia” to introduce quoted words.  
   - Emphatic possessives: “na‘u” in “wahine na‘u” (“my wife”) intensifies Puali‘i’s claim.  
   - Negation and minimization: “He mea ‘ole ia mau mea” (“Those things are nothing”) employs “‘ole” to dismiss concerns.  
   - Coordination: “A ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘i me kāna kāne me Puali‘i” strings together three actors (Pōka‘i, her husband, and Puali‘i) with “me … me …” marking accompaniment.

3. Historical Significance  
   - The episode reflects how chiefly lines maintained alliances through marriage across districts; Puali‘i’s origin in Līhu‘e and Pōka‘ī’s residence on O‘ahu imply political and genealogical connectivity.  
   - The mo‘olelo (traditional narrative) preserves not only genealogy but also social practices—sexual freedom for high-ranking women and the regime of hospitality and honor afforded to a “man of good standing” who visits a chief’s household.  
   - By showing Pōka‘ī negotiating her desirability and consenting on her own terms, the text underscores the agency accorded to Hawaiian women of status in personal and political alliances.  
   - Finally, the vivid use of place-names and everyday language (“lawai‘a,” “hale,” “kula”) provides scholars today with snapshots of land use (fishing grounds, residential compounds, agricultural plains) in pre-colonial Hawai‘i.

Together, these linguistic and cultural layers offer a window into the norms of intimacy, inheritance, and inter-district relations that shaped Hawaiian chiefly societies prior to Western contact.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

Those gardens were called Nāmakaokapāo‘o until now. When the sweet potatoes were thoroughly roasted, Puali‘i spoke his solemn vow (ʻōlelo hoʻohiki): “When the head of the ulua is cooked along with the sweet potatoes, Puali‘i alone shall eat; afterward, the restriction shall be lifted (noa), and his wife, Pōka‘i, and the others may eat.” Then Puali‘i went down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish, that the catch might be eaten together with the sweet potatoes.","1. Cultural and Historical Context  
  • Land and Food Cultivation: The passage reflects the ancient Hawaiian practice of settling (noho) in a fertile place and developing multiple māla (gardens) for staple crops like ʻuala (sweet potato). ʻUala was a key introduction crop, prized for its storage and nutritional value.  
  • Place-Naming (Inoa ʻĀina): The naming of the gardens as Nāmakaokapāo‘o demonstrates how Hawaiians memorialized events, persons, or natural features by bestowing names that endure in oral and geographical memory. This practice anchors genealogy and history in the landscape.  
  • ʻŌlelo Hoʻohiki (Vow-Speech): Puali‘i’s declaration is an example of a formal vow, establishing a period of tapu (restriction). Only after the fulfilled condition—cooking the ulua head with the sweet potatoes—could food be shared (noa) with others. Such vows reinforced chiefly authority, regulated communal resources, and integrated ritual with daily life.  
  • Noa and Tapu: The sequence “eat—then noa—others eat” highlights the interplay of tapu (sacred restriction) and noa (lifting of restriction). This reflects a pervasive organizing principle in Hawaiian society, governing diet, social hierarchy, and spiritual purity.  
  • Fishing at Honouliuli: The descent “iho akula” to the seashore for lawaiʻa (fishing) illustrates the āina‐kanaka (land‐people) relationship, where marine and agricultural resources were managed in concert. Honouliuli remains a known locale on Oʻahu, linking the narrative to real geography.

2. Linguistic Features  
  • ʻIhola: An archaic marker indicating remote past (“long ago, at a time gone by”), often used in moʻolelo (traditional narratives).  
  • Mahi ʻAi vs. Mahi ʻĀina: “Mahi ʻai” here means to cultivate food generally, emphasizing subsistence.  
  • ʻUala Lōʻihi: “Long sweet potatoes,” possibly referring to a prized variety or simply emphasizing abundance.  
  • ʻOʻo ka ʻuala: ʻOʻo can mean “ripe,” “ready,” or “cooked through.” Contextually it signals that the tubers are done and suitable for the vow’s condition.  
  • ʻŌlelo Hoʻohiki: A specialized register—formal, almost juridical speech—marking a promise or oath with social and spiritual force.  
  • Noa: A technical term meaning “free,” “common,” or “lifted from restriction.” Here it marks the transition from tapu food (for the chief alone) to communal sharing.  
  • Iho akula: “Then he descended,” with akula adding emphasis to the action’s immediacy.  
  • E lawaiʻa: The infinitive verbal phrase “to fish,” showing purpose (“in order to fish… to eat”).

3. Historical Significance  
  • The account preserves an origin story for a place-name still recognized in oral tradition and perhaps in land‐survey records.  
  • It illustrates the integration of agriculture and fishing in Hawaiian subsistence systems, under the authority of aliʻi (chiefs) like Puali‘i.  
  • The episode exemplifies how chiefly vows regulated resource use and reinforced status, while ultimately redistributing food to the community once ritual conditions were met.  
  • Linguistically, the text offers snapshots of archaic forms and ritual language, valuable for reconstructing Old Hawaiian syntax and ceremonial registers.

Overall, this passage weaves together genealogy, place‐naming, ritual vocabulary, and subsistence practices, providing a rich window into precontact Hawaiian lifeways and the ways in which land, speech, and social order were inseparable.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

When they reached that sweet potato patch, she said to the children, “Pull up the clumps with their vines, bringing all the sweet potato leaves up; do not leave any that is still growing.” But the children were afraid, so they worked gently on the sweet potatoes and did not pull up the clumps.","1. Cultural-Historical Context  
– Puali‘i here is portrayed as the landowner whose fields (“māla ʻuala”) are being tended. Sweet potatoes (‘uala) were a staple crop in pre-contact Hawai‘i, often cultivated in small terraces and carefully managed.  
– Nāmakaokapāo‘o is more famously known in Hawaiian mythology as a sea deity and sister of Pele. In this version she appears in a human role, ill and dependent on children in the field. The number seventeen (“he ʻumi kumamāhiku”) employs the traditional Hawaiian counting pattern: “kumu” (ten) plus “māhiku” (seven).  
– The description of her body—“elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e”—refers to pox-like pustules. This vividly portrays an illness (ma‘i) still active (“ʻa‘ole i pa‘a kona ma‘i”), underscoring how disease could weaken even a chiefly or divine figure.  

2. Linguistic Features  
– A hala: a temporal marker meaning “when X had gone/past,” here introducing Puali‘i’s absence.  
– Ia wā … i hele ai: “at that time … went,” with the relative marker i after wā.  
– Aspect and mood:  
  • Continuous aspect “e lewalewa ana nō” (“still wasting away”);  
  • Imperative preceded by the direction “kēnā akula ia,” a colloquial marker akin to “then she said.”  
  • Negative imperative “mai waiho” uses mai + verb to forbid leaving any shoots behind.  
– The use of lā‘au (‘uala vines and leaves) in tandem with “pu‘e” (earth clod) reflects a close agricultural lexicon.  

3. Social Dynamics  
– The children’s fear (“maka‘u nō ua keiki”) likely blends respect for Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s illness and authority. Rather than risking her displeasure, they “kāohi mālie” (restrained themselves gently), revealing how social rank and wellbeing could shape labor practices in a family or communal setting.  

4. Significance  
This passage weaves together mythic names, everyday toil, and the reality of sickness. It preserves both genealogical memory (through named figures) and the lived experience of taro or sweet potato cultivation. Linguistically, it showcases Hawaiian’s rich aspectual system and oral-style narration, with vivid imperatives and culturally resonant terms for land division, crops, and illness.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

He did the same until both patches were stripped bare, and the sweet-potato foliage, lush as it was, covered an area about two kanahā (spans) wide.  Then Nāmakaokapāoʻo went back to kindle a fire, and laid four vines of sweet potato directly on the glowing embers to roast.  While he was roasting them, his father Kōlea returned home.  Immediately he asked his wife Pōkaʻī, “Has he eaten?”  She replied, “No.”  Then Pualiʻi said, “Yes—his head and his eyes shall feed on my sweet potatoes today.  Therefore, this is the very day he shall die for me.”","1. Names and Characters  
  • Nāmakaokapāoʻo: A figure in some Hawaiian genealogies and legends, here presented as a laborer who brazenly harvests and cooks sweet potatoes.  
  • Kōlea and Pōkaʻī: His father and mother—Kōlea returns to discover his son cooking the newly pulled crop; Pōkaʻī answers on his behalf.  
  • Pualiʻi: A third speaker, possibly an overseer or high-ranking family member, who invokes a death sentence once the kapu (sacred prohibition) has been broken.

2. Cultural Context  
  • Uala (sweet potato) was a staple root crop in pre-contact Hawaiʻi, valued for its storability and rapid growth.  Each ʻuala patch was treated as a sacred resource under kapu regulations.  
  • A first-harvest ceremony (usually involving the aliʻi or kahuna) was required before anyone might eat the new potatoes.  By stripping and cooking the vines without permission, Nāmakaokapāoʻo violates this kapu.  
  • Roasting on kapaʻili (hot stones) or directly on ʻahu (embers) is the traditional method of preparing ʻuala; the word ʻōhinu connotes the crackling sound of roasting tubers.

3. Key Linguistic Features  
  • Aspectual construction “noke … ana”: “noke aku ana” conveys continual, unremitting action—he persistently tugs the vines.  
  • Pēlā nō … ā pau: “and so he carried on until both patches were done.”  Repetition of tense-aspect markers (“-ana,” “ā”) is typical in oral narrative to create rhythm and emphasis.  
  • He + number + mea: “he kanahā āhua ka nui” uses he + measure word to describe the extent of leaf coverage.  A kanahā (span) is the distance from fingertip to elbow—roughly 10–12 inches—here plural to evoke breadth.  
  • Direct speech tags: nīnau akula … ʻĪ aku … ‘Ī aku Pualiʻi: Markers of rapid conversational exchange, drawing the listener into the drama.

4. Symbolism and Thematic Resonances  
  • The four vines (‘ehā ʻau) may allude to the four fundamental directions or to a small personal ration—roasting only four vines underscores Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s disregard for the community’s subsistence.  
  • “His head and his eyes shall feed on my sweet potatoes” combines metaphor and threat: the very organs that should see and speak truth become instruments of capital punishment.  
  • The invocation of death for kapu-breaking illustrates the absolute authority of sacred law in ancient Hawaiian society.  It also foreshadows later tensions under aliʻi rule between commoners and chiefs.

5. Historical Significance  
  • This passage comes from a traditional genealogical/legendary text—an early form of Hawaiian historiography called ʻaʻolelo nō ka ʻōlelo, where myth and history interweave to transmit social norms.  
  • Preservation of cultivation practices: details about planting, harvesting, roasting, and kapu protocol shed light on everyday life in pre-contact Hawaiʻi.  
  • The narrative encodes a moral lesson: the fruits of the land belong first to the gods and the aliʻi; to violate that order is to invite death.  Such stories undergirded the chiefly right to land and produce—later formalized under the Great Māhele (1848).

In sum, this passage dramatizes the vital role of kapu in regulating food resources, the ritualized economy of the sweet-potato crop, and the formidable power of the aliʻi and kahuna to enforce sacred law.  Its linguistic patterns—continuous aspects, measure phrases, rapid dialogue—preserve the cadence of Hawaiian oral tradition even as they convey a stark lesson on obedience and hierarchy.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p7,1,7,"Lālau akula ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi a hele akula ā  hiki i waena ā loa‘a o Nāmakaokapāo‘o e kunu ana  i nā ‘au ‘uala āna ‘ehā, i luna o ke ahi. ‘Ike maila nā  keiki a pau loa, holo akula lākou ā kū maila ma kahi  lō‘ihi no ka maka‘u ia Puali‘i. ‘Ōlelo akula ‘o Puali‘i  iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “‘Ē\!

All the children saw and scattered—running until they halted far off, for they feared Puali‘i.  
Puali‘i then called to Nāmakaokapāo‘o:  
“Hey! Behold the cleaver in my hand—it is meant to sever your head today. Your head will fall; then we’ll kalua it together with the sweet potatoes, and I shall eat it before anyone else. After that, peace will reign.”  
But Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no heed. Puali‘i spoke again, his second warning. He was about to strike when Nāmakaokapāo‘o began to chant his death prayer for Puali‘i. It ran as follows:

   “My fondest love is on the face of my beloved,  
   It swells, it bursts within me;  
   Whether to eat or to lay aside—  
   Let Nākukui‘aimakaokalani lie safe.  
   That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,  
   This is my dear companion,  
   Nāmakaokai‘a, great chief of Hawai‘i.  
   Let the octopus writhe, let the squid contort—  
   As men with spear,  
   As spear twined with drumbeat—  
   Verily, Nāmakaokapāo‘o will die.”","1. Cultural and Narrative Context  
  • Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o are figures in a traditional mo‘olelo of Hawai‘i, illustrating rivalries among ali‘i (chiefs) and the lethal seriousness with which insults or challenges were met.  
  • The “cleaver” (ko‘ilipi) is a heavy stone or iron blade used both in ritual killing and food preparation; here it blurs the boundary between warfare and feasting.  
  • Planting sweet potatoes above hot coals is a form of hāngi or imu preparation. That Puali‘i threatens to kalua (earth-bake) his rival’s head alongside ‘uala underscores the taboo of cannibalism in warfare—both literal and symbolic.

2. Linguistic Features  
  • “–akula” is an archaic continuative particle marking an action in progress (lēlau akula = “drew forth”).  
  • The vocative “ʻĒ!” alerts the listener and echoes in mele (chants) and ʻōlelo (speech) as a cry of challenge.  
  • Puali‘i’s speech is direct and formulaic: “he mea ‘oki no kou poʻo i kēia lā” (“it is a thing to cut off your head this day”), reflecting the style of formal threats in ali‘i discourse.  
  • Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s chant is a ka pule make (death prayer), structured in parallel lines, invoking both personal affection and cosmic imagery.  
  • Key terms:  
    – wahi pāʻoʻo (“beloved face”), a poetic allusion to the object of one’s deepest attachment.  
    – wahi aikāne (“seat or place of one’s dear companion”), recalling the practice of aikāne—intimate same-sex friendship among ali‘i.  
    – Olelo kūpuna (ancestral words) such as “e hapupuʻu, e hāpāpaʻa” employ reduplication for intensity (swelling, bursting).

3. Names and Symbolism  
  • Nākukui‘aimakaokalani and Kukui‘aimakaokalani: these names invoke the kukui (candlenut tree), a symbol of light and enlightenment, suggesting that even in death one may invoke guiding lights for the afterlife.  
  • Nāmakaokai‘a is styled “ali‘i nui o Hawaiʻi” (“great chief of Hawai‘i”), emphasizing his high rank and justifying the grandeur of his death chant.

4. Historical Significance  
  • This passage exemplifies the fusion of ritual, poetry, and power in Hawaiian chiefly culture. The threat to decapitate and feast on an enemy belonged to a ceremonial language of dominance.  
  • The recitation of a pule make at the moment of death speaks to the Hawaiian view that the dying could wield spiritual power through mele, shaping the fate of both killer and killed.  
  • Socially, the presence of children fleeing underscores how acutely public violence affected entire communities, not merely the ali‘i involved.

5. Broader Literary and Ethnographic Notes  
  • Scholars note that death chants like this often invoke sea creatures (he‘e, hōhē) as metaphors for the soul’s struggle or the flux of life and death.  
  • The interplay of weapons (ihe, the javelin) and instruments (pahu, the drum) in the chant ties physical combat to ritual performance, reminding us that Hawaiian warfare was as much about spiritual assertion as martial skill.  
  • Finally, the swift shift from violence (the cleaver) to poetic lament (pule make) exemplifies the literary fluidity of ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi—where speech acts could instantly move from threat to prayer, from the profane to the sacred.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Here we speak a little about those two names, namely Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻā. They were two high chiefs of Hawaiʻi: Nāmakaokalani was a father, and Nāmakaokaiʻā was a child; yet they entered into the prayer (pule) of Nāmakaokapāoʻo.","1. Cultural Context  
   - Aliʻi Nui (High Chiefs): In traditional Hawaiian society, aliʻi nui held both secular and sacred authority. By identifying Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻā as “mau aliʻi nui lāua no Hawaiʻi,” the text asserts their preeminence in the ruling lineage of the island.  
   - Genealogical Prayer (Pule): The term pule can denote a prayer, a chant, or even a sacred invocation of ancestral names. When chiefs are said to “komo i loko o ka pule” of an ancestor or priestly figure—here, Nāmakaokapāoʻo—it implies they have been invoked or embedded within a ritual genealogy that confers mana (spiritual power) and legitimizes their chiefly status.

2. Linguistic Features  
   - Name-Formation: All three names begin with Nāmaka, the name of the Hawaiian sea goddess.  
     • Nāmakaokalani = Nāmaka o ka lani, “Nāmaka of the heavens/sky.”  
     • Nāmakaokaiʻā = Nāmaka o kaiʻā (kai + ʻā), often glossed “Nāmaka of the restless sea” or “Nāmaka of the fierce sea.”  
     • Nāmakaokapāoʻo = Nāmaka o ka pāʻoʻo, “Nāmaka of the cliff or precipice” (pāʻoʻo).  
   - Grammatical Particles:  
     • ‘O ia ‘o … a me … marks a “namely” construction, introducing specific items in a list.  
     • He … lāua no Hawaiʻi uses he + noun + lāua (dual pronoun) to predicate identity (“they were …”).  
     • He makua kāne … a he keiki … contrasts father and child roles in brief apposition.  

3. Historical Significance  
   - Lineage Legitimization: By placing father and child in the pule of Nāmakaokapāoʻo—a presumably foundational ancestor or deity—the text underscores continuity of rank and divine favor across generations. Such insertion into a pule could have occurred during a formal investiture or the composition of a genealogical chant recited at key events (births, deaths, successions).  
   - Regional Anchorage: The mention of these aliʻi nui “no Hawaiʻi” anchors their power on the island of Hawaiʻi itself, distinguishing them from ruling lines on Maui, Oʻahu, or elsewhere. This localization speaks to inter-island politics, where each major island maintained its own high chiefs, often competing or allying through marriage and ritual.  
   - Preservation of Oral Tradition: The very act of pausing to “ʻōlelo iki” (speak briefly) about names indicates the text’s function as both a genealogical record and an educational narrative—preserving sacred names and their connections for future generations.  

In sum, this short paragraph not only names two eminent chiefs but situates them within the sacred genealogical chant of an earlier ancestor, thereby affirming their divine lineage, political authority, and the centrality of ritual invocation in maintaining aliʻi power.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p9,1,9,"A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o, i ia wā i  ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o, e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i  iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē.

Yet the blade’s edges turned back upon Puali‘i himself, and the head was severed and fell off to a place apart.  From that detached head Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Greetings to you, O Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Then Nāmakaokapāo‘o seized Puali‘i’s head and hurled it into the waters of Waipouli—a bay on the shore of Honouliuli, five miles in length.","1. Cultural and Mythological Context  
– Nāmakaokapāo‘o (“The Gaping-eyed Sea”) is a prominent figure in Hawaiian cosmology, often portrayed as a sea goddess and sister of Pele.  Her power over the ocean makes her both protector and avenger.  Puali‘i in this passage appears as a challenger or aggressor who dares to attack the deity during her sacred prayer (pule).  The episode exemplifies the fusion of ritual (the prayer), supernatural combat, and landscape, for Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s victory is immediately commemorated in geographic memory—Waipouli and Honouliuli.  

– The invocation and destruction of Puali‘i’s head, followed by its defiant farewell (“Aloha ‘oe…”), encapsulates two key Hawaiian values: the sanctity of pule (prayer/chant) and the mana (spiritual power) of names—even a severed head retains voice and identity.  That voice returns honor (“aloha”) to the victorious deity before its final disposal into the sea, symbolizing the ultimate triumph of divine order over mortal or chaotic force.  

2. Linguistic Features  
– Nominalization: ka pule ‘ana (“the praying,” “the prayer”) and ke ‘o‘oki ‘ana (“the act of cutting”), marked by the suffix ‑‘ana, turn verbs into nouns, a common Hawaiian strategy for expressing ongoing or completed actions.  

– Relative clauses with ai: i ia wā i ‘o‘oki ai Puali‘i… (“at the time when Puali‘i cut…”) uses the ai-clause to locate the action in time.  

– Instrumental and directional particles: e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i iā Puali‘i (“that the blades of the adze would turn toward Puali‘i”) features:  
 • e … aku — a purposive or irrealis marker indicating intention or eventual result;  
 • ā… — an instrumental marker emphasizing the means (“by the blades”);  
 • iā — the personal object marker, marking Puali‘i as the target of the turned blade.  

– Passive/resultative sense: moku ke po‘o (“the head was severed/shattered”) treats the head as the subject experiencing the cutting.  This is a concise way to state a violent result without naming the agent again.  

– Personification and dialogue: Pane mai ke po‘o o Puali‘i (“the head of Puali‘i answered”) attributes speech to the detached head, a dramatic device underscoring the residual mana of Puali‘i’s being.  The direct quote “Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o” preserves the vocative e-marker and the intimate greeting aloha—here used even at the moment of death as a mark of respect and closure.  

– Sequential actions: lālau akula … a kiola akula (“then she grasped…and then she threw”) uses the adverbial particle akula twice to signal a tight sequence—first one action, then immediately the next.  

3. Historical and Topographical Significance  
– The mention of Waipouli and Honouliuli anchors this myth in real ʻāina (land).  Honouliuli was an ancient ahupua‘a (land division) on O‘ahu’s leeward coast; Waipouli (“bitter water”) names a cove known for its brackish springs.  By assigning a precise length (“five miles”), the text preserves oral geographic knowledge and demonstrates how myth and place-memory intertwine in Hawaiian tradition.  

– This passage exemplifies how Native Hawaiian mo‘olelo (stories) serve multiple purposes:  
 • They transmit genealogies of gods and heroes.  
 • They encode cultural values around prayer, respect for the sacred, and the potency of language.  
 • They map the islands—linking supernatural events to identifiable landmarks.  

Together, these elements make the passage both a riveting narrative of divine justice and a miniature atlas of Hawaiian spiritual geography.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, was residing at Waikīkī. A man came all the way from Honouliuli to Waikīkī, where the chief was staying, and said:  
“O chief! There is a little child of exceptional strength—his father is dead, and his head was thrown far out to sea, five miles away.”  
When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he thought, “Since he has such strength I will kill him,” but then he added, “No, I will not kill him—he has no strength.” As he spoke these words in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard them.","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant.

But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",
