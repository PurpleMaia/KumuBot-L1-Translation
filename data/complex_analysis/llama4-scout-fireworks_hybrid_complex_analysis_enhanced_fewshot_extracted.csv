There was no one like him from Hawai'i all the way to Ni'ihau in his small stature and bravery. His father was Kauluakaha'i from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in Kahikinu'u. His mother was Pōka'ī. His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part god.","• This paragraph introduces the main protagonist, **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** (m) (the eyes of the pāo'o fish), described as a little boy and incredibly strong when he was very young, with no comparison from Hawai'i to Ni'ihau for his small stature and strength.

– The name **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** can be broken down into its components: *nā* (plural marker), *maka* (eyes), *o* (of), and *ka pāo'o* (the pāo'o fish). The pāo'o fish is a type of fish that was considered sacred in Hawaiian culture.

• The second part of the paragraph introduces the parents of **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o**: 
  – **Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i** (m) (the inspiration of Kaha'i) his father, from **Kahiki-papa ia-lewa** (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign country), a place in **Kahiki-nu'u** (Kahiki at the summit, a foreign country). 
  – **Pō-ka-'ī** (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high chief') his mother.

– **Kahikipapaialewa** and **Kahikinu'u** are likely references to mythical or ancestral places, possibly in a foreign country or a spiritual realm. **Kahiki** is a term used to refer to a mythical or ancestral place, often associated with the gods.

• The description of **Kauluakaha'i** as a high chief of **Kahikipapaialewa** and part god (*'ao'ao akua*) suggests that he holds a high status in society and has a connection to the divine.

– In Hawaiian culture, chiefs (*ali'i*) were considered to be descended from the gods and held important roles in society. The term *'ao'ao akua* suggests that **Kauluakaha'i** has a divine or semi-divine status.

• This paragraph sets the stage for the story, introducing the main protagonist and his family, and establishing their connection to the divine and their high status in society. 

– The use of mythical and ancestral places, as well as the description of **Kauluakaha'i** as part god, suggests that the story may be set in a mythical or legendary time period, possibly during the 'Ai Kapu era.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This chapter presents a rich and complex narrative that warrants a nuanced analysis of its themes, allegorical meanings, historical context, and cultural significance. At its core, the story of Nāmakaokapāo'o revolves around the life of a prodigious child born with extraordinary strength, whose existence is marked by violence, power struggles, and the transformation of the social and cultural landscape of Hawai'i.

One of the primary themes that emerges from this narrative is the tension between traditional Hawaiian values and the influence of external forces. The character of Nāmakaokapāo'o, with his incredible strength and bravery, embodies the ideal of a powerful leader, while his stepfather Puali'i represents a more mundane and ordinary individual. The conflict between these two characters serves as a metaphor for the struggle between traditional Hawaiian culture and the encroaching forces of Westernization and modernity.

The narrative also contains several allegorical references that warrant closer examination. The sweet potato patches, ʻNā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o,' in Keahumoa, Līhu'e, serve as a symbol of sustenance, nourishment, and community, highlighting the importance of land, food, and familial relationships in Hawaiian culture. The character of Puali'i, with his flawed and ultimately doomed attempt to assert dominance over Nāmakaokapāo'o, can be seen as a representation of the failed attempts of colonial powers to impose their will on Hawai'i.

The historical and cultural context of this narrative is crucial to understanding its significance. The story was first published in the Hawaiian language newspaper, *Ka Nūpepa Kū'oko'a*, in 1894, a time of great upheaval and transformation in Hawai'i. The overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai'i in 1893 had significant implications for the cultural, social, and economic fabric of the islands. The publication of this narrative during this period suggests that it may have been intended to serve as a form of cultural resistance or a means of asserting Hawaiian identity in the face of colonial encroachment.

The chapter's significance in Hawaiian literature and cultural analysis lies in its representation of the complexities and challenges faced by Hawai'i during this period. The narrative offers insights into the cultural values, historical events, and social dynamics that shaped the lives of Hawaiians during this time. Furthermore, the story's focus on the life of a powerful and extraordinary individual serves as a commentary on the nature of leadership, power, and authority in Hawaiian culture.

A closer examination of individual passages reveals a number of interesting insights. For example, Nāmakaokapāo'o's prayer for his death, which invokes the names of powerful chiefs and ancestral figures, highlights the importance of spiritual and cultural practices in Hawaiian society. The character of 'Ama'u, a chief from O'ahu, serves as a symbol of the established power structures that Nāmakaokapāo'o challenges and ultimately overthrows.

The temporal context of this narrative is also noteworthy. The story's publication in 1894, following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai'i, suggests that it may have been intended to serve as a form of cultural resistance or a means of asserting Hawaiian identity in the face of colonial encroachment. The narrative's focus on the life of a powerful and extraordinary individual, who challenges and ultimately transforms the social and cultural landscape of Hawai'i, can be seen as a commentary on the need for Hawaiian self-determination and cultural revitalization during this period.

In conclusion, this chapter presents a rich and complex narrative that offers insights into the cultural values, historical events, and social dynamics that shaped the lives of Hawaiians during this period. The story's themes, allegorical meanings, and cultural significance make it an important contribution to Hawaiian literature and cultural analysis."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Kauluakaha‘i then returned to his land, leaving Pōka‘ī pregnant and alone; later, she gave birth. Upon giving birth, Pōka‘ī and her child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, were extremely poor.","• **Paragraph 2:** This paragraph continues the story from the previous paragraph, providing more details about the circumstances surrounding the conception and birth of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish), and the social and economic challenges faced by his mother, Pō-ka-'ī (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high chief).
• The name 'Hō‘ae‘ae' likely refers to a place in 'Ewa, O‘ahu. 'Ewa was one of the most populated areas in Hawai'i during the 'Ai Kapu era, and it was also an area known for its rich agricultural land. The fact that Pō-ka-'ī and Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i (the inspiration of Kaha'i) conceived a child in 'Ewa suggests that they may have been visiting or residing there temporarily.
• The phrase 'launa kino ai me ka moe 'ana iho' describes the conception of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o through sexual intercourse. This phrase is noteworthy because it provides insight into the cultural attitudes towards sex and reproduction during the 'Ai Kapu era. In Hawaiian culture, sex was not considered a taboo topic, but it was viewed as a sacred act that required respect and responsibility.
• Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i, the father of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, returns to his land, leaving Pō-ka-'ī pregnant and alone. This event may symbolize the challenges faced by single mothers in Hawaiian society during the 'Ai Kapu era. 
– The departure of Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i may also be seen as a metaphor for the disconnection between the parents and the child's uncertain future.
• The birth of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is marked by extreme poverty, which is described as 'ilihune loa' (extreme poverty). This phrase highlights the difficulties faced by Pō-ka-'ī and her child, and it may serve as a commentary on the social and economic challenges faced by many families in Hawaiian society during this time period.
– The use of the phrase 'ilihune loa' to describe the poverty of Pō-ka-'ī and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may also be seen as a way of emphasizing the vulnerability and resilience of the characters.
• Overall, this paragraph provides valuable insights into the cultural and social context of the 'Ai Kapu era, and it sets the stage for the challenges that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and his mother will face in the story to come. 
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may be seen as a symbol of the child's connection to his parents and his cultural heritage. The pāo'o fish was a sacred animal in Hawaiian culture, and it was often associated with fertility and abundance. The use of this name may serve as a way of emphasizing the child's connection to the natural world and his role in the continuation of his family's lineage.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

He visited the home of Pōka'ī. Puali'i looked at Pōka'ī and liked her, and said, ""I'd like you to be my woman."" Pōka'ī replied, ""How can you possibly want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is ruined."" Puali'i said, ""Those things don't matter. If you like me, let's sleep together."" Pōka'ī agreed. And Pōka'ī, with her child and Puali'i, went to live on the plains of Keahumoa.","• This paragraph introduces Pua-li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described as a good man, from in-land at Lī-hu'e (Wāhiāwā), who had come to go fishing at Hon-o-uliuli (bay of many dark or secret things), likely a fishing location in 'Ewa, but somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-'ī was living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. 
– In the 'Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to every destination and it was normal to call in to the house of strangers and ask for food and water. It was normal to receive strangers at one's home and provide them with food and water, and it was considered rude to refuse generosity. 
– This is a custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the reason Pua-li'i called in at Pōka'ī's house and why Pōka'ī received Pua-li'i in her home, where he observed how she was living.

• Pua-li'i falls in love with Pō-ka-'ī and proposes a long-term relationship. 
– Pō-ka-'ī (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high chief') expresses hesitation due to a negative self-image, citing that she had given birth to a child and that her body was ruined.
– Pua-li'i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a long-term relationship and acknowledge each other as ʻkāne' (boyfriend, husband, long-term lover) and ʻwahine' (girlfriend, wife, long-term lover). 
– The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Lī-hu'e (Wāhiāwā), where Pua-li'i is from, to live.

• The conversation between Pua-li'i and Pō-ka-'ī shows that Pua-li'i is not concerned with Pō-ka-'ī's past or her current situation, and he is willing to accept her and her child.
– This reflects a cultural value in which relationships and family were highly valued, and people were often willing to form new relationships and create new families.

• This paragraph also highlights the changing values and social norms during the 'Ai Kapu era.
– Pua-li'i's willingness to accept Pō-ka-'ī and her child, and to form a new relationship with her, reflects a shift away from the strict social norms of the 'Ai Kapu era, in which social status and purity were highly valued.

• The names of the characters also provide insight into their personalities and roles in the story.
– Pua-li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line) is described as a good man, and his name reflects his chiefly or noble status.
– Pō-ka-'ī (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high chief') is a woman who has given birth to a child, and her name reflects her role as a mother and a woman. 

• The location of Ke-ahumoa (perhaps a heap of chickens or a place of many chickens) is also significant, as it reflects the rural or countryside setting of the story.
– The fact that the couple relocates to Ke-ahumoa suggests that they are seeking a new life or a fresh start in a rural or natural setting. 

• The story also highlights the importance of relationships and family in Hawaiian culture.
– The conversation between Pua-li'i and Pō-ka-'ī shows that relationships and family are highly valued, and that people are often willing to form new relationships and create new families.

• The story also provides insight into the cultural and social norms of the 'Ai Kapu era.
– The 'Ai Kapu era was a time of great change and upheaval in Hawaiian society, and the story reflects the shifting values and social norms of this time. 

• The use of the phrase ""e moe kāua"" (let's sleep together) also suggests a cultural practice in which relationships were formed through mutual agreement and consent.
– This phrase reflects a cultural value in which relationships were based on mutual respect and agreement, rather than on strict social norms or expectations.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories.

Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

When the sweet potatoes were ready, Puali'i said in his promise, ""When we two eat the head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato, then Puali'i will eat, and then his wife, Pōka'ī, and the others will eat."" So, Puali'i went to the shore of Honouliuli to go fishing to catch fish to eat with the sweet potatoes.","• This paragraph continues to describe the lives of Puali'i, Pōka'ī, and Nāmakaokapāo'o, emphasizing their agricultural activities and the cultural practices of the time. 
– The passage mentions ""ʻelua āna mau māla ʻuala lōʻihi"" (two long sweet potato patches), indicating that Puali'i and Pōka'ī were actively engaged in farming, which was a crucial aspect of Hawaiian subsistence and economy.
• The naming of the sweet potato patches by Nāmakaokapāo'o, ""ʻo Nāmakaokapāo'o ā hiki i kēia lā"" (Nāmakaokapāo'o [named them] and [the name] remains so to this day), suggests that Nāmakaokapāo'o has a significant role or connection to the land and the family's agricultural activities.
– The use of ""ā hiki i kēia lā"" (until this day) implies a sense of continuity and tradition, highlighting the importance of preserving cultural knowledge and practices.
• Puali'i's statement, ""Aia ā kālua ke poʻo o ka ulua me ka ʻuala, a ʻai ʻo Pualiʻi, a laila, noa, ʻai kāna wahine, Pōkaʻī a me nā mea ʻē aʻe"" (When we two eat the head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato, then Puali'i will eat, and then his wife, Pōka'ī, and the others will eat), reveals a cultural practice where the head of the ulua fish was considered a delicacy and was eaten in a ceremonial or ritualistic context.
– The mention of ""ke poʻo o ka ulua"" (the head of the ulua fish) and its pairing with ""ka ʻuala"" (sweet potatoes) may symbolize the balance and harmony between the sea and the land, which were essential aspects of Hawaiian cultural and spiritual practices.
– The term ""noa"" (free, unrestricted) in this context may indicate that the consumption of food was not restricted by the 'Ai Kapu rules, which dictated who could eat certain foods and when.
• Puali'i's decision to go fishing at Honouliuli, ""Iho akula ʻo Pualiʻi i kai o Honouliuli e lawaiʻa i iʻa ʻai pū me ka ʻuala"" (Puali'i went to the shore of Honouliuli to go fishing to catch fish to eat with the sweet potatoes), demonstrates the importance of fishing and seafood in the Hawaiian diet and economy.
– The location of Honouliuli, which is associated with 'Ewa, Oʻahu, may hold cultural significance, as it was an area known for its rich marine resources and was likely a site for fishing and other subsistence activities.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p5,1,5,"A hala ‘o Puali‘i i ka lawai‘a, i ia wā ‘o   Nāmakaokapāo‘o i hele ai me nā keiki he ‘umi  kumamāhiku i nā māla ‘uala a Puali‘i. ‘O ke kino o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ia wā, he kino ‘u‘uku loa, ‘elua  kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e, ‘a‘ole i pa‘a kona  ma‘i, e lewalewa ana nō.

Nāmakaokapāo'o's body at that time was incredibly small, not even two and a half feet tall, and his sickness was not cured, he was still ailing. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, he said to the children, ""Pull out the sweet potato vines and leaves completely from the ground, don't leave any growing."" However, the children were afraid, so they remained still by the sweet potatoes and did not pull out the vines.","• This paragraph provides further insight into Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's character and his influence on others, specifically children. 
– Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is described as having an incredibly small body and not being fully cured of his sickness, suggesting that he might still be in a state of vulnerability or weakness. 
– The fact that he is accompanied by sixteen children (he 'umi-kumamāhiku) to Pua-li'i's sweet potato patches suggests that he might be gathering a group to carry out a task or cause some sort of disruption. 
• The name Pua-li'i can be broken down into Pua- (child/descendant) and -li'i (chief/chiefly line), suggesting a connection to or descent from a chiefly lineage. 
– Puali'i's absence (hala 'o Puali'i i ka lawai'a) due to fishing activities implies that he might be preoccupied with providing for his family or community, leaving his sweet potato patches unattended and vulnerable to disruption by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and the children. 
• The instructions given by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o to the children to pull out the sweet potato vines and leaves completely from the ground (e huhuki i ka pu'e me ka lau 'uala ā pau loa i luna) can be seen as an act of destruction or chaos, possibly symbolizing a rejection of traditional practices or the existing social order. 
– The children's fear (maka'u nō ua keiki) and refusal to carry out Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's instructions (kāohi mālie nō ma ka 'uala, 'a'ohe huhuki i ka pu'e) suggest that they might be aware of the potential consequences of such actions or that they are loyal to Pua-li'i and his property. 
• This event could be seen as an allegory for the transition from the 'Ai Kapu era to a more modern or progressive time. 
– Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's actions, though destructive, might represent a necessary step towards change and growth, while Pua-li'i's adherence to traditional practices and property rights might symbolize the resistance to such change. 
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into Nā-maka- (the eyes of) and -o-ka-pāo'o (the pāo'o fish), possibly suggesting a connection to intuition, insight, or spiritual guidance, which could be guiding his actions. 
• The cultural context of this passage is likely rooted in the 'Ai Kapu era, a period of Hawaiian history characterized by a complex system of rules and prohibitions. 
– The 'Ai Kapu era was marked by a strong emphasis on tradition, social hierarchy, and spiritual practices, which might be reflected in Pua-li'i's fishing activities and his concern for his sweet potato patches. 
– Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's actions, on the other hand, might represent a challenge to these traditional practices and social norms, potentially symbolizing a shift towards a more modern or Westernized way of life. 
• The significance of sweet potatoes (uala) in this passage should not be overlooked. 
– Sweet potatoes were a staple crop in ancient Hawai'i and played a crucial role in the traditional Hawaiian diet and economy. 
– The destruction of the sweet potato patches by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o could be seen as a metaphor for the disruption of traditional ways of life and the need for adaptation to changing circumstances.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

He continued tearing them apart until both sweet potato patches were finished, and forty mounds of sweet potato leaves had risen. Then, Nāmakaokapāo'o went back, lit a fire, and broiled four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was broiling them over the fire, his stepfather arrived, and asked his mother, Pōka'ī: ""Not yet."" Puali'i said: ""Yes, his head and eyes are what I'll eat with my sweet potatoes today, so today is the day he will die.""","• In this paragraph, Nāmakaokapāo'o is described as engaging in destructive behavior, specifically targeting sweet potato patches, which were a crucial food source in ancient Hawaiian society. The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into – Nā-maka (the eyes) and – o-ka-pāo'o (of the pāo'o fish), suggesting a connection to the natural world and possibly a special status or role in the community.

• The action of yanking out sweet potato patches, tearing apart one on top of another, and creating forty mounds of sweet potato leaves, can be seen as an act of chaos and disruption. This behavior may be interpreted as a rejection of traditional practices and values associated with the 'Ai Kapu era, where sweet potatoes were a staple crop.

• The number forty (kanahā) may hold symbolic significance, as it is a multiple of the sacred number 4, often associated with the four cardinal directions, the four elements, and the four seasons.

• Puali'i's response to Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions, stating that he will eat the boy's head and eyes with his sweet potatoes, is a metaphorical expression of his anger and frustration. This statement can be seen as a reference to the 'Ai Kapu practice of human sacrifice, where humans were substituted for ulua fish in rituals. Puali'i's threat may be interpreted as a desire to revert to older, more traditional practices, whereas Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions represent a move towards a new, more progressive way of thinking.

• The character of Puali'i, as Nāmakaokapāo'o's stepfather, may represent a conflicting influence or perspective, one that is rooted in traditional practices and values. The name Puali'i can be broken down into – Pua (child, descendant) and – li'i (chief, royalty), suggesting a connection to the chiefly class and possibly a role as a guardian or protector of traditional knowledge and practices.

• The conversation between Puali'i and Pōka'ī highlights the tension between traditional and progressive values. Pōka'ī's response, "" 'A'ole"" (not yet), may indicate a sense of hesitation or uncertainty, while Puali'i's statement, ""'Ae, 'o ke po'o ona a me nā maka ka mea e 'īna'i ai ku'u 'uala i kēia lā"" (yes, his head and eyes are what I'll eat with my sweet potatoes today), underscores the conflict between these two perspectives.

• This paragraph can be seen as an allegory for the transition from the 'Ai Kapu era to a more modern, progressive way of thinking. Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions represent a rejection of traditional practices, while Puali'i's response symbolizes a desire to hold onto the past. The outcome of this conflict will likely have significant implications for the characters and the community.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw him and ran to a distance because they were afraid of Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Hey! Here is the adze in my hand, it is for cutting off your head today, and your head will be cut off, then we'll eat the sweet potatoes together, and I'll eat first, then you'll be free."" Nāmakaokapāo'o did not listen to Puali'i's words, so Puali'i spoke again. Puali'i was about to cut Nāmakaokapāo'o with the adze when Nāmakaokapāo'o prayed his death prayer for Puali'i. The prayer was like this: 
""Only the eyes of my pāo'o fish,
Hapupu'u and hāpāpa'a, 
Eat or spare,
Spare perhaps Nākukui'aimakaokalani,
Kukui'aimakaokalani is the one,
My little brother is this one,
Nāmakaokai'ā is the great chief of Hawai'i,
Distract, distract only the delusion,
The people are with the spear,
The spear is with the sounding board,
Death to Nāmakaokapāo'o.""","• Paragraph 7 opens with Pua-li'i seizing the adze and approaching Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, who was broiling his four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the children saw Pua-li'i and ran away because they were afraid of him. This fear is likely due to Pua-li'i's violent behavior and aggressive demeanor, which is consistent with his previous actions and words; 
– Pua-li'i threatens Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, saying that he will cut off his head with the adze and then eat the sweet potatoes together, with Pua-li'i eating first. This act of violence and cannibalism is a clear indication of Pua-li'i's disregard for human life and his adherence to the 'Ai Kapu culture, where human sacrifice was practiced; 
• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o does not respond or react to Pua-li'i's threat, which prompts Pua-li'i to prepare to cut him with the adze. However, at this moment, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o prays his death prayer for Pua-li'i; 
– The prayer recited by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is rich in symbolism and cultural references. The pāo'o fish is likely a reference to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's name, which means ""the eyes of the pāo'o fish."" The use of this imagery may be a metaphor for Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's own vulnerability and mortality; 
– The names Kukui'aimakaokalani and Nākukui'aimakaokalani are mentioned in the prayer, which may be references to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's own identity and lineage. The use of these names may be a way of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o asserting his connection to his family and ancestors; 
– The prayer also contains references to the people, spears, and sounding boards, which may be symbolic of the cultural and spiritual practices of the 'Ai Kapu era. The use of these images may be a way of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o invoking the power of his ancestors and the spiritual forces that govern the world; 
– The final line of the prayer, ""Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo'o,"" is a declaration of death for Pua-li'i. This line may be seen as a form of counter-curse or counter-magic, where Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is attempting to turn the tables on Pua-li'i and assert his own power and agency; 
• The use of prayer and spiritual practices in this passage highlights the importance of spiritual and cultural traditions in Hawaiian society. The 'Ai Kapu era was a time of great spiritual and cultural change, and the practices and rituals described in this passage reflect the complex and often contradictory nature of this era; 
• The character of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is portrayed as a powerful and resourceful individual who is able to use his spiritual and cultural knowledge to counter Pua-li'i's violence. This portrayal may be seen as a reflection of the importance of intelligence, strategic thinking, and spiritual power in Hawaiian culture.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

They were high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani was a father and Nāmakaokai‘a was a child. However, (the influence of) Nāmakaokapāo‘o had entered into (the thinking of) Nāmakaokai‘a.","• This paragraph provides additional background information on two chiefly individuals: Nā-maka-o-ka-lā-ni (the eyes of the sky) and Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish). 
– The prefix 'Nā-maka-o' in both names suggests a connection to the protagonist, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish), and may imply a familial or spiritual relationship.
– Ka-lā-ni: 'lā' (sun) and 'ni' (sky or heaven), suggesting an exalted or elevated status; 
– Ka-i‘a: 'i‘a' (fish), which could symbolize abundance, sustenance, or spiritual nourishment.
• The passage establishes that Nā-maka-o-ka-lā-ni was a high chief and the father of Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a. 
– The mention of 'Hawai'i' as their domain indicates that they were of high rank and possibly connected to the ruling class of the islands.
• The phrase ""ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo'o"" translates to ""(the influence of) Nāmakaokapāo'o had entered into (the thinking of) Nāmakaokai‘a.""
– This implies that Nāmakaokapāo'o's influence or power had begun to affect Nāmakaokai‘a, potentially altering his thoughts, actions, or decisions.
– This could be seen as a form of spiritual or psychological manipulation, where Nāmakaokapāo'o's presence or charisma had a profound impact on Nāmakaokai‘a.
• The 'Ai Kapu era in Hawaiian history was marked by a complex system of spiritual and social rules, which often involved the exercise of power and influence by ali'i (chiefs) and kāhuna (priests).
– The mention of Nāmakaokapāo'o's influence on Nāmakaokai‘a may allude to the ways in which spiritual and cultural forces shaped the lives and decisions of individuals during this period. 
– This could also suggest that Nāmakaokapāo'o was a charismatic or powerful figure, capable of exerting a profound impact on those around him. 
• The narrative may be using these characters and their relationships to explore themes of power, influence, and cultural identity during the 'Ai Kapu era. 
– By examining the interactions and dynamics between these characters, the story may be offering insights into the complexities of Hawaiian society and culture during this time.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The head of Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o, ""Aloha, Nāmakaokapāo'o."" Nāmakaokapāo'o picked up the head of Puali'i and threw it into Waipouli, a bay on the shore of Honouliuli, which was five miles away.","• This paragraph describes a pivotal event in the story, showcasing Nāmakaokapāo'o's extraordinary abilities and the consequences of Puali'i's actions. 
– The use of the adze (ko'ili) as a weapon is significant, as it was a common tool in ancient Hawaiian society, but also symbolizes the violent clash between characters.
• The phrase ""A pau ka pule 'ana a Nāmakaokapāo'o"" indicates that Nāmakaokapāo'o had finished praying, suggesting a connection between his spiritual practices and the events that unfold.
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its components: Nā-maka (the eyes) and o-ka-pāo'o (of the pāo'o fish), which may symbolize his connection to the spiritual realm and his extraordinary abilities.
• Puali'i's attempt to harm Nāmakaokapāo'o with the adze is thwarted, and the ko'ili instead strikes Puali'i, severing his head. 
– This event can be seen as a turning point in the story, highlighting Nāmakaokapāo'o's strength and potentially divine nature.
• The severed head of Puali'i speaks to Nāmakaokapāo'o, saying ""Aloha 'oe, e Nāmakaokapāo'o,"" which can be interpreted as a sign of respect, affection, or even a warning.
– The use of ""Aloha"" in this context is interesting, as it is often associated with love, compassion, and forgiveness in Hawaiian culture.
• Nāmakaokapāo'o then takes Puali'i's head and throws it into Waipou-li (spring water- li'i possibly a reference to a chief or a supernatural being), a location on the shore of Honou-li'uli (bay of dark- 'uli'uli possibly a reference to the spiritual realm or a place of darkness).
– The distance of five miles that the head travels is notable, potentially symbolizing the extent of Nāmakaokapāo'o's power and influence.
• This event may be seen as an allegory for the clash between traditional Hawaiian values and the imposition of foreign influences, with Puali'i representing the old order and Nāmakaokapāo'o embodying the new, spiritually empowered generation.
– The 'Ai Kapu era, during which human sacrifice was practiced, is referenced through the violent act of Puali'i and the subsequent consequences, highlighting the complexities of Hawaiian cultural history.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
