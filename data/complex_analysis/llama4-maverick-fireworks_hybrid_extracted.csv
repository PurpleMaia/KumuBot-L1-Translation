namakaokapaoo_ch1_p1,1,1,"He keiki ‘u‘uku loa ‘o **a)** Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a he  keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio, ‘a‘ohe ona lua  ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau, i ka  ‘u‘uku a me ke koa loa. **b1)** ‘O Kauluakaha‘i, kona   makua kāne, **c)** no Kahikipapaialewa, he ‘āina i  Kahikinu‘u. **b2)** ‘O Pōka‘ī ka makuahine. **c)** He ali‘i  nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa, a **b1)** he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a very small child, but he was a very strong child in his youth, and there was no one on these islands from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau who could match his small size and great strength. His father was Kauluakaha‘i, from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinu‘u. His mother was Pōka‘ī. His father was a great chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he was also of the godly line.","The passage introduces Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a figure of significance in Hawaiian cultural narratives, highlighting his extraordinary strength despite his small size. The text begins by establishing Nāmakaokapāo‘o's unique physical attributes and prowess, emphasizing that he was unmatched in strength among the islands from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau. This geographical reference encompasses the main Hawaiian Islands, underscoring Nāmakaokapāo‘o's exceptional status.

The mention of his parents, Kauluakaha‘i and Pōka‘ī, provides genealogical context, which is crucial in Hawaiian culture for understanding an individual's social status, spiritual connections, and ancestral lineage. The father's origin, Kahikipapaialewa in Kahikinu‘u, is significant as it ties Nāmakaokapāo‘o to a specific geographical and possibly spiritual or ancestral location. Kahikinu‘u is associated with the broader region of Kahiki, a term used in Hawaiian traditions to refer to places outside of Hawai‘i, often linked to ancestral homelands or spiritual realms.

The description of Kauluakaha‘i as a ""he ali‘i nui"" or great chief, indicates that Nāmakaokapāo‘o comes from a line of high-ranking chiefs, suggesting a connection to the ruling or noble class. The term ""ali‘i"" refers to the chiefly or aristocratic class in ancient Hawaiian society, who held significant power, wealth, and spiritual authority.

The phrase ""he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona"" or ""he was also of the godly line,"" is particularly noteworthy. It suggests that Kauluakaha‘i, and by extension Nāmakaokapāo‘o, have a divine or semi-divine ancestry. In Hawaiian culture, the concept of being ""of the godly line"" connects individuals to the akua (gods) and implies a sacred or spiritual dimension to their lineage and possibly their roles or destinies. This divine connection is a common feature in the genealogies of high-ranking chiefs and is used to legitimize their rule and authority.

Linguistically, the passage employs classical Hawaiian narrative style, characterized by the use of metaphorical language and genealogical references to establish the subject's identity and significance. The text assumes a level of cultural knowledge about Hawaiian genealogy, geography, and the importance of chiefly lineage, reflecting the oral traditions and historical narratives that were central to Hawaiian culture.

Historically, this passage reflects the importance of genealogy and ancestral connections in understanding an individual's place within Hawaiian society. It also highlights the cultural values placed on strength, lineage, and spiritual or divine connections, which were integral to the social and political structures of ancient Hawai‘i.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97).

Pōka‘ī was pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land. Pōka‘ī stayed with her pregnancy, and later, she gave birth. At this birth, Pōka‘ī and her child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, were extremely poor.","The passage provided is a narrative from Hawaiian oral tradition, detailing a significant event in the genealogy of a particular family or chiefly line. To understand its cultural, historical, and linguistic significance, it's essential to break down the elements within the passage.

1. **Cultural Context**: The passage revolves around the conception and birth of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, indicating the importance of genealogical lineage in Hawaiian culture. Genealogy was crucial for establishing chiefly legitimacy, tracing ancestry to gods, and understanding familial relationships. The narrative suggests that Nāmakaokapāo‘o's birth is significant, possibly marking the beginning of a notable lineage.

2. **Linguistic Features**:

The linguistic features and cultural practices described in the passage are characteristic of traditional Hawaiian storytelling, emphasizing the value of understanding such narratives within their cultural and historical contexts.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p3,1,3,"Iā lāua e noho ana, iho maila ‘o Puali‘i, he  kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e, i ka lawai‘a ma kai o  Honouliuli, kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka‘ī.

Puali‘i said, ""Those things are nothing, if you want me, we can lie together."" Pōka‘ī agreed. And Pōka‘ī returned with her husband and Puali‘i to the uplands of Keahumoa, where they lived.","The passage provided is a narrative from a traditional Hawaiian story, likely from a mo‘olelo (Hawaiian historical or legendary narrative). To understand its cultural, historical, and linguistic significance, it's essential to break down the content and context.

Culturally, this passage reflects the complex social dynamics and relationships within ancient Hawaiian society. The narrative involves Puali‘i, a man from Līhu‘e, who visits Pōka‘ī, a woman already in a relationship or married, and expresses his desire to be with her. Pōka‘ī is initially hesitant due to her having borne a child and concerns about her physical condition. This exchange highlights several cultural aspects:

1. **Attitudes towards relationships and marriage**: The passage suggests a certain fluidity in relationships. Puali‘i's direct approach to Pōka‘ī and her eventual agreement to be with him, despite being with another man, indicate that Hawaiian societal norms around marriage and relationships might have been more flexible or different from those in European cultures. However, it's also worth noting that the narrative does not necessarily condone or condemn Puali‘i's actions, presenting them in a matter-of-fact manner.

2. **Social and geographical mobility**: The characters' movements between different locations (e.g., from the sea off Honouliuli to the uplands of Keahumoa) reflect the mobility within ancient Hawaiian society. People moved for various reasons, including fishing, visiting, and relocating for social or economic reasons.

Linguistically, the passage is rich in features characteristic of the Hawaiian language:

1. **Verb-initial word order**: Hawaiian typically follows a verb-subject-object (VSO) word order, as seen in ""Iho maila ‘o Puali‘i"" (came down Puali‘i), where ""iho maila"" is the verb phrase indicating the action of coming down.

2. **Use of particles and grammatical markers**: Particles like ""iā"" (indicating the object of a verb or preposition), ""‘o"" (marking the subject of a sentence), and ""ia"" (object marker) are crucial for understanding the grammatical structure. For example, ""Iā lāua e noho ana"" uses ""iā"" to indicate the object of the verb ""noho"" (to live or stay), and ""e"" to mark the verb as being in a progressive or continuous aspect.

3. **Cultural and contextual vocabulary**: Terms like ""lawai‘a"" (fishing) and places like ""Līhu‘e,"" ""Honouliuli,"" and ""Keahumoa"" are not just geographical or occupational references but also carry cultural significance. They situate the narrative within a specific historical and geographical context, grounding the story in known Hawaiian places and practices.

Historically, this passage, while not dated, reflects aspects of pre-contact or early post-contact Hawaiian society. The lack of European loanwords or references to European customs or objects suggests it may be describing a period before significant European influence. The narrative's focus on traditional activities like fishing and the movement between different ecological zones (coastal to upland areas) also points to a time when Hawaiian society was organized around subsistence activities closely tied to the land and sea.

In conclusion, this passage offers insights into the social dynamics, linguistic characteristics, and cultural practices of ancient Hawaiian society. It highlights the complexity of relationships, the importance of geographical mobility, and the rich cultural context in which these narratives were told. Understanding such passages requires a nuanced appreciation of Hawaiian language, culture, and history, underscoring the value of preserving and studying Hawaiian mo‘olelo.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

And when the taro matured, Puali‘i said in his oath, ""When the head of the ulua fish and the taro are cooked, Puali‘i will eat, and then it will be free from kapu, and his wife, Pōka‘ī, and others will eat. Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat together with the taro.","The passage is rich in cultural, historical, and linguistic significance, offering insights into traditional Hawaiian practices, the importance of 'āina (land), and the spiritual and social protocols of ancient Hawaiian society.

Culturally, the passage highlights the significance of farming and fishing in Hawaiian subsistence practices. The mention of 'elua āna mau māla 'uala lō'ihi (two long taro patches) underscores the importance of taro ('uala) as a staple crop in Hawaiian agriculture and diet. Taro was not only a primary food source but also held spiritual and cultural significance, being associated with the god Kāne and considered a symbol of fertility and prosperity.

The naming of the taro patches as Nāmakaokapāo‘o indicates the practice of giving names to significant geographical or agricultural features, a common tradition in Hawaiian culture that connects people to the land and their ancestors. The persistence of the name ""to this day"" (ā hiki i kēia lā) suggests a continuity of cultural practices and memory.

The passage also illustrates the kapu system, a complex set of spiritual and social rules that governed ancient Hawaiian life. Puali‘i's 'ōlelo ho‘ohiki (oath or vow) establishes a kapu on the taro and fish until he has eaten, after which it becomes noa (free from kapu), allowing others, including his wife Pōka‘ī, to partake in the meal. This highlights the hierarchical and spiritual dimensions of food consumption in ancient Hawaii, where certain individuals, often of higher rank or spiritual significance, would eat first, and the act of eating was imbued with ritual and social protocol.

Linguistically, the passage is characterized by the use of classical Hawaiian vocabulary and grammatical structures. The text employs a formal, somewhat archaic style, reflective of the language used in traditional narratives and historical accounts. The use of specific terms like 'ōlelo ho‘ohiki for an oath or vow and the distinction between kapu and noa demonstrate the nuanced understanding of spiritual and social concepts in the Hawaiian language.

Historically, the passage provides a glimpse into the pre-contact or early contact period Hawaiian society, highlighting practices related to agriculture, fishing, and the kapu system. The specific location mentioned, Honouliuli, is an area on the island of O'ahu, indicating that the narrative is grounded in a particular geographical context, potentially linking the story to actual historical or legendary events or figures.

The narrative also reflects the interdependence of land and sea resources in Hawaiian subsistence strategies, as Puali‘i goes fishing to complement the taro from his patches. This interdependence is a recurring theme in Hawaiian cultural practices and is reflective of a broader ecological understanding that integrates human activity with the natural environment.

Overall, the passage is a valuable window into the cultural, historical, and linguistic practices of ancient Hawaii, offering insights into the daily life, spiritual beliefs, and social structures of Hawaiian society before significant external influences altered its trajectory.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, she told the children, ""Pull out all the sweet potato tubers and leaves, don't leave any to grow."" However, the children were afraid, so they were gentle with the sweet potatoes, and none of the tubers were pulled out.","The passage provided is a narrative snippet likely from a traditional Hawaiian story or historical account, given the context and the names mentioned. Let's break down the cultural, linguistic, and historical aspects of this passage.

1. **Cultural Context**: The passage involves characters named Puali'i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, with the latter being associated with a significant event or action involving children and a sweet potato ('uala) patch. 'Uala was a staple crop in ancient Hawaii, used for food and played a crucial role in the diet and economy. The act of going to someone else's 'uala patch and instructing children to pull out the tubers and leaves could imply a conflict, a test of authority, or a demonstration of power or control. The fact that Nāmakaokapāo‘o is described as being very small and having an unresolved illness adds a layer of intrigue, possibly highlighting her spiritual or supernatural strength despite her physical condition.

2. **Linguistic Features**: The passage is rich in Hawaiian linguistic features. For example, the use of ""he 'umi kumamāhiku"" to denote thirteen children is a traditional way of counting that reflects the indigenous method of enumeration. The phrase ""‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e"" (two and a half feet tall) demonstrates how measurements were described, using parts of the body (in this case, ""kapua‘i"" meaning foot or stride) as units. The verb ""huhuki"" (to pull out) is used in the context of harvesting or uprooting, showing the specific actions associated with agricultural practices.

3. **Historical Significance**: The narrative likely stems from pre-contact or early contact Hawaiian history, given the context of 'uala cultivation and the lack of any European or modern influences mentioned. The characters and events described could be part of oral traditions passed down through generations, offering insights into the social dynamics, agricultural practices, and possibly the spiritual or supernatural beliefs of ancient Hawaiians. Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a figure associated with Pele, the volcano goddess, in Hawaiian mythology, suggesting that this passage might be part of a larger narrative involving volcanic or supernatural themes.

4. **Analysis of Specific Terms and Phrases**:
   - ""A hala ‘o Puali‘i i ka lawai‘a"" suggests Puali'i was engaged in fishing, indicating a separation of activities possibly by gender or role within the community.
   - ""Nāmakaokapāo‘o i hele ai me nā keiki he ‘umi kumamāhiku"" indicates Nāmakaokapāo‘o's action of going with a specific number of children, which could symbolize a significant group or task.
   - The description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o's size and health (""he kino ‘u‘uku loa, ‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e, ‘a‘ole i pa‘a kona ma‘i"") is crucial as it contrasts her physical vulnerability with her ability to give instructions or exert influence.
   - The children's fear (""maka‘u nō ua keiki"") and their gentle handling of the 'uala (""kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala"") suggest a respect or fear towards Nāmakaokapāo‘o, possibly due to her identity or status.

In conclusion, this passage offers a glimpse into the cultural practices, linguistic nuances, and historical context of ancient Hawaii, highlighting the importance of understanding the indigenous perspective and the significance of traditional narratives in Hawaiian culture.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

In the same way, she pulled until both gardens were finished, and the appearance of the ‘uala leaves stood upright, the two gardens being about forty fathoms in size. Then Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned and lit a fire, and four bunches of ‘uala were roasted on the stove that was burning. While it was roasting on the fire, her father, Kōlea, returned home and asked his mother, Pōka‘ī: ""No."" Puali‘i said, ""Yes, his head and eyes are the things that will make my ‘uala finish today, so this is the day he will die by my hand.""","The passage provided is from a traditional Hawaiian narrative, likely from a historical or cultural text. To understand its significance, it's essential to break down the cultural context, linguistic features, and historical importance.

Culturally, this passage revolves around the character Nāmakaokapāo‘o and her interaction with her family members, specifically her father, Kōlea, and possibly her mother or another female figure, Pōka‘ī. The narrative highlights Nāmakaokapāo‘o's industrious nature as she works on pulling up or harvesting ‘uala (sweet potatoes) from two large gardens. The size of the gardens, described as being about forty fathoms (āhua) in size, indicates the scale of her labor. The act of roasting ‘uala on a fire is a traditional Hawaiian cooking method, underscoring the cultural practices described.

Linguistically, the passage is rich in traditional Hawaiian vocabulary and grammatical structures. The use of ""noke aku ana"" indicates continued action, translating to ""continued to."" The term ""āhua"" is used to describe the size or extent of something, in this case, the gardens, and is translated as ""fathoms,"" though it can imply a measure or extent. The narrative also employs a mix of active and passive voice, as seen in ""huhuki ā pau"" (pulling until finished), which highlights the completion of an action. The dialogue between characters is direct, with ""‘A‘ole"" (No) and ""‘Ae"" (Yes) being used to convey a disagreement or contrasting views between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i.

Historically, this passage reflects traditional Hawaiian agricultural practices and familial dynamics. The cultivation and preparation of ‘uala (sweet potatoes) are significant, as ‘uala was a staple crop in ancient Hawaiian society. The narrative also touches on themes of family, labor, and possibly conflict or tension, as hinted at by Puali‘i's ominous statement about the fate of Kōlea. The mention of specific characters and their interactions suggests that this passage is part of a larger story that may involve themes of family dynamics, revenge, or the consequences of actions.

The historical significance of this passage lies in its portrayal of traditional Hawaiian practices and the insight it provides into the social and cultural fabric of ancient Hawaiian society. The detailed description of agricultural practices and food preparation methods offers a window into the daily life and labor of Hawaiians in the past. Furthermore, the narrative's focus on character interactions and dialogue highlights the importance of family and interpersonal relationships in Hawaiian culture.

Overall, this passage is a valuable resource for understanding Hawaiian cultural practices, linguistic nuances, and historical contexts, providing a glimpse into the lives and traditions of Native Hawaiians.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw him and ran to stand at a distance, fearing Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, ""Hey! Here is the adze in my hand, it is a thing to cut off your head today, and when your head is cut off, then it will be cooked with taro, and I will eat it first, and then it will be free from kapu."" Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not listen to Puali‘i's words, and then Puali‘i spoke again, a second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut off Nāmakaokapāo‘o's head with the adze when Nāmakaokapāo‘o prayed his death prayer for Puali‘i. The prayer went like this: 
Pity the eyes of my dear one, 
They are closing, they are fixed, 
Perhaps they will eat, perhaps they will leave, 
Perhaps Nākukui‘aimakaokalani will leave, 
That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani, 
This is my dear companion, 
Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i, 
Slipping away, the lazy one slips away, 
It is people with spears, 
It is spears with clubs, 
Nāmakaokapāo‘o will surely die.","This passage is rich in cultural, historical, and linguistic significance, offering insights into ancient Hawaiian society, its values, and practices. Here's a breakdown of these aspects:

1. **Cultural Context**: The passage revolves around a confrontation between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, involving a threat of violence and a prayer. It highlights the importance of understanding the social dynamics and the kapu (taboo) system in ancient Hawaii. The mention of an adze (ko‘ilipi) and the act of roasting taro tops ('au 'uala) on the fire are indicative of everyday activities and the tools used. The fear exhibited by the children upon seeing Puali‘i with an adze underscores the gravity of the situation and the potential for violence.

2. **Linguistic Features**: The passage is characterized by the use of classical Hawaiian, which is distinct from modern Hawaiian due to its more complex grammatical structures and vocabulary. The use of ""akula"" and ""aila"" indicates a narrative progression and is typical of classical Hawaiian storytelling. The dialogue between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, particularly the threat and the subsequent prayer, showcases the poetic and metaphorical nature of Hawaiian oratory. The prayer itself is a fine example of Hawaiian poetic composition, with its use of metaphor (e.g., ""Pity the eyes of my dear one""), parallelism (""e hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei""), and invocation of specific names and concepts.

3. **Historical Significance**: The names mentioned, such as Puali‘i, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Nāmakaokai‘a, are significant as they relate to historical or legendary figures. Nāmakaokai‘a being referred to as the ""great chief of Hawai‘i"" suggests a connection to the ruling ali‘i class, indicating the passage's roots in historical or quasi-historical narratives. The content and structure of the prayer, with its references to specific individuals and the use of particular imagery, may also provide clues about the historical context and the cultural practices of the time.

4. **Analysis of the Prayer**: The prayer recited by Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a crucial element of the passage. It is a death prayer (pule make) aimed at Puali‘i, invoking various images and names that are not fully explained within the passage. The prayer's structure and content suggest a complex interplay of emotions, loyalties, and spiritual beliefs. The reference to ""Nākukui‘aimakaokalani"" and ""Kukui‘aimakaokalani"" may be related to specific deities or ancestral figures, highlighting the spiritual dimension of Hawaiian culture. The final lines, with their reference to ""people with spears"" and ""spears with clubs,"" followed by the assertion that ""Nāmakaokapāo‘o will surely die,"" indicate a fatalistic or prophetic tone, underscoring the gravity of the confrontation.

In conclusion, this passage offers a window into the cultural practices, linguistic nuances, and historical narratives of ancient Hawaii. Its analysis requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from Hawaiian language, history, and cultural studies to fully appreciate its significance.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Here, a little will be said about those two names, namely Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a; they were both high chiefs of Hawai‘i, Nāmakaokalani was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the child, but Nāmakaokai‘a was taken in by the prayers of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","The given passage is a snippet from a Hawaiian text that discusses the relationship between two chiefs, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, and their connection to another figure, Nāmakaokapāo‘o. To understand the cultural, historical, and linguistic significance of this passage, it's essential to break down its components.

Linguistically, the passage is written in a formal, narrative style characteristic of traditional Hawaiian storytelling. The use of ""Ma 'ane'i"" (Here) as an introductory phrase is typical in Hawaiian texts, serving to draw the reader's attention to the subject matter that follows. The phrase ""e 'ōlelo iki no"" (a little will be said about) indicates that the narrative will provide a brief discussion or explanation regarding the topic at hand, in this case, the names Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a.

The names Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a are significant because they are associated with high-ranking chiefs (""ali‘i nui"") of Hawai‘i. The term ""ali‘i nui"" refers to chiefs of the highest rank, who held considerable power and were often associated with divine lineage or mana. The relationship between Nāmakaokalani (the father) and Nāmakaokai‘a (the child) suggests a familial connection between two important figures, potentially indicating a succession or a significant event within the ali‘i lineage.

The mention of Nāmakaokapāo‘o and the phrase ""ua komo i loko o ka pule"" (was taken in by the prayers) is particularly noteworthy. ""Ka pule"" refers to prayers or spiritual practices, and the context suggests that Nāmakaokai‘a was either adopted or protected through the spiritual intervention of Nāmakaokapāo‘o. This could imply that Nāmakaokapāo‘o held significant spiritual or religious authority, or that the event was of considerable importance to warrant divine or spiritual intervention.

Historically, the passage hints at the complex social and familial dynamics among the ali‘i class in ancient Hawai‘i. The ali‘i were not only political leaders but also held important religious roles. The narrative suggests that spiritual practices and familial relationships were intertwined, with spiritual intervention playing a role in the lives and possibly the succession or protection of high-ranking chiefs.

Culturally, the passage reflects the importance of 'ohana (family) and the role of spiritual practices in ancient Hawaiian society. It also underscores the significance of understanding the genealogical and spiritual connections between individuals within the ali‘i class, as these connections were crucial to establishing legitimacy, authority, and mana.

In conclusion, this passage provides a glimpse into the complex societal structure of ancient Hawai‘i, highlighting the interplay between familial relationships, spiritual practices, and the ali‘i class. The linguistic features of the passage, including its formal narrative style and the use of specific Hawaiian terms, contribute to a nuanced understanding of Hawaiian cultural and historical contexts.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p9,1,9,"A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o, i ia wā i  ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o, e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i  iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē.

The head of Puali‘i responded to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: ""Aloha to you, Nāmakaokapāo‘o."" Nāmakaokapāo‘o seized the head of Puali‘i and threw it into the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the shore of Honouliuli, which is five miles long.","The passage provided is a narrative from Hawaiian oral tradition, likely from a mo‘olelo (historical or legendary account) or a ka‘ao (legendary tale). The story revolves around a confrontation between two figures, Nāmakaokapāo‘o and Puali‘i, and involves elements of violence, supernatural occurrences, and geographical references.

Culturally, this passage reflects several key aspects of Hawaiian tradition and society. Firstly, the use of an adze (ko‘i) as a weapon is significant. Adzes were not only tools used for woodworking and other crafts but also held spiritual and ceremonial importance. The fact that the adze turns against Puali‘i, severing his head, may symbolize a form of divine retribution or the manifestation of spiritual power (mana). The severed head continuing to speak is a motif found in various Polynesian cultures, often signifying the power and mana of the individual even in death.

The exchange of ""aloha"" between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and the severed head of Puali‘i is also noteworthy. ""Aloha"" is a complex term that encompasses love, compassion, and greeting. In this context, it may be interpreted as a sign of respect or acknowledgment between the two characters, despite their adversarial relationship.

Linguistically, the passage is rich in traditional Hawaiian vocabulary and grammatical structures. The use of ""i ia wā"" to indicate the timing of events (""at that time"") is characteristic of narrative devices used in Hawaiian storytelling to sequence events. The verb ""‘o‘oki"" (to strike or chop) followed by ""i luna pono"" (right on top) provides a vivid image of the action. The phrase ""e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i"" illustrates the use of causative verbs (""ho‘ohuli"" to cause to turn) and the incorporation of specific terms for parts of tools (""nā ‘oi"" referring to the sharp edge), showcasing the detailed and nuanced nature of the Hawaiian language.

Historically, the passage references specific geographical locations, such as Waipouli and Honouliuli, which are associated with the island of O‘ahu. Honouliuli is known as an ahupua‘a (land division) on the leeward coast of O‘ahu, indicating that the narrative is tied to specific places and potentially to the history or legends of that area. The mention of a cave (""ana"") at Waipouli, described as being on the shore, adds to the geographical and cultural detail, as caves often held spiritual or practical significance in ancient Hawaiian society.

The length of the cave, described as being ""‘elima mile ka loa"" (five miles long), is a notable detail. While this might be an exaggeration or a metaphorical expression, it underscores the significance of the location and possibly its perceived extent or importance.

Overall, this passage offers insights into Hawaiian cultural practices, linguistic nuances, and historical or legendary narratives. It highlights the complexity and richness of Hawaiian oral traditions and the importance of understanding these stories within their cultural and historical contexts.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
