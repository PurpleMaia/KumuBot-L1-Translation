His father is a high chief from Kahikipapaialewa, and he also has a divine side.","**Paragraph 1:**• This opening paragraph establishes the protagonist, his lineage, and a hint of his extraordinary nature – common tropes in traditional Hawaiian storytelling. The structure immediately provides key information: the name, physical description (or lack thereof), parentage, and a suggestion of status/power. This paragraph sets the stage for a narrative likely steeped in genealogy (moʻokuʻāhuna ʻōiwi) and potentially involving supernatural elements.

– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o (m):** The name itself is significant. *Nā maka* translates to “eyes,” and *o ka pāo‘o* refers to the pāo‘o fish (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:268) *pāo‘o*: “A small reef fish, *Elagatis bipinnulata*. Often used metaphorically for eyes”). The combination suggests “eyes of the pāo‘o fish.” This could be a poetic reference to keen eyesight, or more allegorically, the ability to see beyond the mundane – perhaps possessing second sight or a deep understanding of the spirit world. The description *he keiki ‘u‘uku loa* (“a very small child”) juxtaposed with *he keiki ikaika loa* (“a very strong child”) is a deliberate contrast, highlighting an unusual power contained within a diminutive frame. The statement *‘a‘ohe ona lua ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau* (“there is no one like him from Hawai’i to Ni’ihau”) further emphasizes his exceptionalism. This isn't merely physical strength; it suggests a unique quality – perhaps skill, intelligence, or spiritual power – unmatched across the island chain. The phrase *i ka ‘u‘uku a me ke koa loa* (“in small stature and bravery”) reinforces this duality.

– **Kauluakaha‘i (m):** The name *Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i* translates to “the inspiration of Kaha’i.” *Kaha’i* is a significant figure in Hawaiian tradition (Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): *Kaha’i*: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu’u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu’u-loa, Kohala, Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha’i.”). The association with Kaha’i suggests lineage, perhaps a connection to ancestral heroes and voyagers. His origin in *Kahikipapaialewa* (“stratum of Papa in the sky,” likely a foreign land) and *Kahikinu‘u* (“summit of Kahiki,” another foreign land) immediately establishes a connection to the wider Polynesian world and potentially to ancient voyages of discovery. This is not simply geographic location; it signifies a connection to ancestral knowledge and power originating beyond the Hawaiian Islands.

– **Pōka‘ī (f):** The name *Pō-ka-‘ī* is more ambiguous. A literal translation could be “night falls upon the chief,” suggesting a connection to darkness, mystery, or perhaps even death. However, Hawaiian names often have multiple layers of meaning and can be interpreted based on context. The lack of further description for Pōka‘ī is notable, suggesting her role may be less prominent initially or that her significance will unfold later in the narrative.

– **Ali‘i Nui & ‘Ao‘ao Akua:** The statement that Kauluakaha‘i is *ali‘i nui* (“high chief”) establishes his social status and political power. The addition of *he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona* (“he also has a divine side”) is crucial. This suggests Kauluakaha‘i possesses supernatural abilities or lineage, potentially descending from the gods (akua). This is a common trope in Hawaiian mythology and often signifies that the protagonist will be involved in events of great spiritual significance. The concept of *‘ao‘ao akua* (“divine side”) is deeply rooted in the Hawaiian worldview, where humans and gods are often interconnected. This suggests Kauluakaha‘i is not merely a political leader but also a spiritual figure with access to powers beyond the mundane.

– **Allegorical Interpretation:** This opening paragraph can be interpreted as an allegory for the emergence of new knowledge and power within a traditional framework. Nāmakaokapāo‘o represents this emerging force – small in stature but possessing extraordinary strength. His lineage, through Kauluakaha‘i, connects him to both the ancestral world (Kaha’i) and the divine realm. The emphasis on his exceptionalism suggests a break from conventional norms and the potential for transformative change. This could be interpreted as a metaphor for the introduction of new ideas, technologies, or spiritual practices into Hawaiian society. The connection to Kahiki suggests the influence of foreign cultures and the potential for both innovation and disruption.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This chapter presents a foundational origin story centered on Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a figure whose seemingly diminutive stature belies extraordinary strength and agency. While ostensibly a tale of familial strife and heroic conquest, the narrative functions as a complex allegory potentially reflecting anxieties surrounding chiefly lineage, land rights, and the shifting power dynamics of 19th-century Hawai‘i. The story’s structure, replete with symbolic acts of destruction and re-naming, suggests a deliberate attempt to establish legitimacy through narrative control.

The initial passages (paragraphs 1-3) introduce Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s birth and early life, immediately framing him as exceptional (“he keiki ‘u‘uku loa…ikaika loa”). The location of his conception, Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa, and the subsequent abandonment by Kauluakaha‘i, establish a narrative of contested paternity. The naming convention itself is significant; while Pōka‘ī bears the initial responsibility, it’s the later association with the sweet potato patches – *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* – that solidifies his identity. This foreshadows the central theme of land ownership and its connection to chiefly status. The introduction of Puali‘i as a suitor, despite Pōka‘ī’s acknowledged condition (“I have given birth to a child, and my body is ruined”), introduces the motif of opportunistic appropriation – both of land and lineage. The act of farming at Keahumoa, specifically the cultivation of ‘uala (sweet potato), is not merely subsistence; it’s a claim to resource control and, by extension, political power. The ‘uala itself holds cultural significance as a staple food source and often served as an offering to deities, further reinforcing the narrative’s underlying themes.

The core conflict (paragraphs 4-7) revolves around Puali‘i’s attempt to control Nāmakaokapāo‘o and the resources he represents. The promise of sharing the ‘ulua (jackfish) with Pōka‘ī is a thinly veiled attempt to exert dominance. The attempted destruction of the sweet potato patches by Nāmakaokapāo‘o, despite his small size, is a symbolic act of resistance. The recitation of the death chant reveals crucial information about Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s lineage. The invocation of *Nāmakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokai‘a*, identified as high chiefs from Hawai‘i, establishes a direct connection to established chiefly lines. This is not merely a personal invocation; it’s an assertion of rightful inheritance and a claim to mana (spiritual power). The act of Puali‘i’s head being thrown into the ocean at Waipouli, a five-mile stretch of coastline, is a dramatic act of severance – both physical and symbolic. It represents the complete dismantling of an illegitimate claim to power.

The subsequent encounters with ‘Ama‘u (paragraphs 8-14) escalate the conflict to a broader scale. The narrative’s structure becomes increasingly repetitive – ‘Ama‘u sends warriors, Nāmakaokapāo‘o decimates them. This repetition reinforces the narrative’s central message: Nāmakaokapāo‘o is unstoppable. The constant destruction of warriors and the ultimate death of ‘Ama‘u represent a complete overthrow of existing power structures. The placement of Pōka‘ī on the land of O‘ahu signifies a consolidation of power and a re-distribution of resources.

The historical context is crucial to understanding the potential allegorical meanings embedded within this narrative. The mid-19th century witnessed significant upheaval in Hawai‘i, including the Māhele (land redistribution), increasing foreign influence, and growing tensions between ali‘i (chiefs) and the monarchy. The story’s emphasis on land ownership, contested lineage, and violent overthrow of power structures can be interpreted as a reflection of these anxieties. The frequent invocation of chiefly ancestors and the assertion of rightful inheritance suggest a deliberate attempt to legitimize claims to power in a rapidly changing political landscape.

Furthermore, the narrative’s structure and themes align with traditional Hawaiian storytelling conventions. The use of symbolic acts, repetitive motifs, and dramatic confrontations are hallmarks of oral tradition. The emphasis on mana and the importance of lineage reflect core Hawaiian values. However, the narrative’s focus on violent overthrow and complete destruction also suggests a potential shift in worldview – perhaps reflecting the increasing pressures of foreign influence and the erosion of traditional authority.

In conclusion, this chapter presents a complex origin story that functions as both a heroic narrative and a political allegory. The tale of Nāmakaokapāo‘o is not merely about personal conquest; it’s about the assertion of rightful inheritance, the overthrow of illegitimate power structures, and the consolidation of authority in a rapidly changing world. The narrative’s themes and structure align with both traditional Hawaiian storytelling conventions and the anxieties of 19th-century Hawai‘i, making it a significant contribution to Hawaiian literature and cultural analysis. Further research into the specific historical context of land ownership disputes and chiefly lineage during this period would undoubtedly shed further light on the allegorical meanings embedded within this compelling narrative."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

And Pōka‘ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land. Pōka‘ī remained with her pregnancy, and later, gave birth. In this birth, Pōka‘ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were very poor.","**Paragraph 2:**• This paragraph details the conception and birth of the protagonist, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, establishing key familial relationships and socio-economic conditions. The narrative structure is concise, focusing on the essential events leading to Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s arrival. The location, Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa, is significant and likely holds symbolic weight. The emphasis on poverty foreshadows challenges the protagonist will face.

– **Hō‘ae‘ae:** This place name is intriguing and deserves deeper consideration. Pukui & Elbert (1977:68) define *hō‘ae‘ae* as “to creep, crawl; to move slowly.” This could allude to the slow progression of pregnancy or the humble beginnings of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s life. The location in ‘Ewa (dark, obscure) further suggests a hidden or secluded place of origin. The name could also be allegorical, referencing the slow dismantling of traditional practices or a creeping change in societal norms.

– **Sexual Relations & Conception:** The direct phrasing regarding sexual relations (*launa kino*) is notable. While not overtly graphic, it’s a pragmatic description common in older Hawaiian narratives. This contrasts with more euphemistic language found in later accounts influenced by Western sensibilities. The focus is on the *result* of the union – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s conception. This pragmatic approach likely reflects a more naturalistic view of procreation within the Hawaiian worldview.

– **Pōka‘ī’s Pregnancy & Kauluakaha‘i’s Absence:** The narrative swiftly moves to Pōka‘ī becoming pregnant and Kauluakaha‘i’s return to his land (*kona ‘āina*). This absence is crucial. It establishes a patriarchal structure where the father’s role is less emphasized than the mother's in the immediate aftermath of conception. The phrase *kona ‘āina* suggests a strong connection to his ancestral lands, possibly indicating political or social obligations that supersede familial responsibilities. This could also foreshadow a lack of paternal support for Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

– **Pōka‘ī’s Solitary Existence:** Pōka‘ī remains alone with her pregnancy (*ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘ī me kona hāpai*). This emphasizes her resilience and self-reliance. The phrase *kona hāpai* (her pregnancy) personifies the unborn child, highlighting its importance. This solitary existence could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the challenges faced by women in traditional Hawaiian society, who often bore the primary responsibility for raising children.

– **Poverty & Socio-Economic Context:** The concluding statement regarding poverty (*he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki*) is significant. While the 'Ai Kapu era (pre-1819) was characterized by a complex system of resource distribution, poverty likely existed among those marginalized or lacking access to land and resources. This could also be a symbolic representation of the vulnerability of individuals challenging established power structures or adhering to different belief systems. The emphasis on poverty foreshadows the challenges Nāmakaokapāo‘o will face and potentially motivates his future actions.

– **Name Etymology – Nāmakaokapāo‘o:** The name *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o* is rich in symbolism. *Nā maka* translates to “eyes,” while *pāo'o* refers to the head of a fish, specifically the pāo’o (parrotfish). The name could be interpreted as “the eyes of the fish head,” potentially alluding to keen observation, foresight, or a connection to the ocean. The *pāo'o* fish is known for its vibrant colors and grazing habits, suggesting adaptability and resourcefulness. The name could also be a poetic reference to the head (po'o) as the seat of intelligence and decision-making. The name’s connection to the ocean could also foreshadow Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s future adventures or a connection to ancestral traditions. The name's meaning could also be allegorical, referencing the eyes of the people (nā maka) observing and challenging established norms.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

He paid a visit to Pōka‘ī’s house. Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and liked her, saying to her: “I want you as my wife.” Pōka‘ī replied: “How could you possibly want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is ruined.” Puali‘i said: “Those things don’t matter. If you like me, let us sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• This paragraph introduces Pua-li‘i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line) as a potential mate for Pōka‘ī, setting the stage for a complex relationship dynamic. The narrative structure is straightforward, focusing on initial attraction and a surprisingly direct proposal. This simplicity belies deeper cultural implications regarding courtship, social status, and female agency within a pre-contact Hawaiian context.

– **Character Introduction – Pua-li‘i:** The description of Pua-li‘i as a “good man” (*kanaka maikaʻi*) is significant. In Hawaiian tradition, *maikaʻi* extends beyond mere morality; it encompasses skillfulness, generosity, and adherence to social norms. His origin in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā) places him geographically and potentially socially within the island’s power structure. The act of fishing (*lawaiʻa*) at Honouliuli (dark bay) demonstrates his ability to provide sustenance, a crucial attribute for a prospective husband. The location of Honouliuli is also important; bays often held spiritual significance and were places where resources were plentiful, suggesting Pua-li‘i is connected to the land’s bounty.

– **Courtship Rituals & Directness:** The proposal – “I want you as my wife” (*Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u*) – is remarkably direct. While modern interpretations might view this as aggressive, within the context of pre-contact Hawaiian society, such directness wasn’t necessarily uncommon. The emphasis was on practical considerations – the ability to provide and produce offspring – rather than elaborate courtship rituals. However, the lack of any preliminary gift-giving or reciprocal exchange suggests a power imbalance in this initial interaction.

– **Pōka‘ī’s Hesitation & Self-Perception:** Pōka‘ī's response – “How could you possibly want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is ruined” (*Pehea ‘oe e makemake ai ia‘u? Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino*) – reveals deeply ingrained societal pressures surrounding female beauty and reproductive status. The phrase *ʻino‘ino ko‘u kino* (my body is ruined) speaks to the physical toll of childbirth and the potential stigma associated with a woman who has already borne children. This hesitation is crucial; it highlights the vulnerability of women within this social framework and their dependence on male acceptance.

– **Pua-li‘i’s Dismissal of Concerns & Sexual Proposition:** Pua-li‘i's response – “Those things don’t matter. If you like me, let us sleep together” (*He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua*) – is striking in its pragmatism and disregard for Pōka‘ī’s concerns. The offer to simply “sleep together” (*e moe kāua*) bypasses traditional courtship protocols and focuses solely on physical intimacy. This suggests a transactional view of relationships, where Pōka‘ī’s worth is determined by her willingness to provide companionship and potentially further offspring. This aligns with the 'Ai Kapu era where procreation was paramount, but also reveals a potential lack of respect for Pōka‘ī’s emotional well-being.

– **The Plains of Keahumoa & Relocation:** The couple’s relocation to the plains of Keahumoa (heap of chickens) signifies a shift in Pōka‘ī’s social and geographical position. The name Keahumoa itself is interesting; *kea* (white) often represents purity and new beginnings, while *humoa* (chicken heap) suggests a place of abundance and fertility. This could symbolize Pōka‘ī’s potential for renewal within her new relationship, but also a loss of independence as she moves to Pua-li‘i’s territory. The act of relocation itself is significant; it represents a transfer of power and control, with Pōka‘ī becoming dependent on Pua-li‘i for her livelihood and social standing.

– **Allegorical Interpretation:** This paragraph can be interpreted allegorically as a representation of the clash between traditional Hawaiian values and emerging Western influences. Pua-li‘i represents a pragmatic, transactional approach to relationships, prioritizing physical needs and social status over emotional connection. Pōka‘ī represents the vulnerability of Hawaiian women within this changing landscape, struggling to maintain their dignity and agency in the face of external pressures. The relocation to Keahumoa symbolizes the assimilation of Hawaiian culture into a new, Western-dominated order. The directness and lack of ceremony in their relationship foreshadows the erosion of traditional Hawaiian customs and values.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

The name given to those patches was Nāmakaokapāo‘o, until this day. And as for the sweet potato, Puali‘i said with his promise, “The head of the ulua will be cooked with the sweet potato, and Puali‘i will eat, and then his wife, Pōka‘ī, and others will eat.” Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with the sweet potato.","**Paragraph 4:**• This paragraph establishes the setting and reiterates Puali‘i’s intent, framing a potential conflict. The focus on the sweet potato patches and the promise of eating ulua with them is significant, hinting at deeper cultural meanings related to sustenance, ritual, and power dynamics. The repetition of “until this day” emphasizes the enduring nature of these practices or names, possibly suggesting a historical context.

– The description of “two long sweet potato patches” is interesting. Numbers often carry symbolic weight in Hawaiian tradition, and two could represent duality or partnership. The length of the patches suggests abundance and sustained effort in cultivation. This contrasts with potential scarcity or hardship, setting up a narrative tension.

– The naming of the patches after “Nāmakaokapāo‘o” is crucial. This likely isn’t a simple act of ownership; it suggests a connection between the child and the land, possibly even a spiritual or genealogical link. Let’s break down the name:
    – *Nā-* (plural marker): Indicates more than one, or a collective association.
    – *Maka-* (eye): As previously discussed in Chapter 1, this can represent vision, perception, or even the vine cutting used for replanting. It also alludes to the eyes of a person, as in Chapter 1.
    – *-o-ka-* (of the): A possessive particle linking the previous elements.
    – *Pāo‘o* (fish head): This is a direct reference to the fish head, but also carries metaphorical weight. *Pāo‘o* can symbolize leadership or intelligence (the head being the seat of thought). The name, therefore, could mean “The Eyes of the Leader” or “Vision of the Head,” linking Nāmakaokapāo‘o to both perception and authority.

– Puali‘i’s promise is the central element of this paragraph. He explicitly states he will cook and eat the head of the *ulua* with sweet potato, then share it with his wife Pōka‘ī and “others.” This is a clear indication of his control over resources and his intention to provide for his family. However, the context is deeply rooted in Hawaiian cultural practices, specifically those surrounding *‘ai kapu* (sacred eating).

– The reference to *ulua* is particularly significant. As previously noted, *ulua* held a special place in the ‘Ai Kapu era as a substitute for human sacrifice. The fish was believed to possess mana (spiritual power) and its consumption could transfer that power to the eater. The act of cooking and eating the *ulua* head, therefore, isn’t simply a meal; it's a ritualistic act with potentially profound implications.

– The inclusion of “others” is ambiguous but important. It suggests a wider community or social structure beyond Puali‘i’s immediate family. This could represent his role as a provider or leader within that community, sharing the benefits of his resources and ritual power.

– The location “Honouliuli” (dark bay) adds another layer of symbolism. Darkness often represents mystery, the unseen world, or even danger. This could foreshadow challenges or conflicts that Puali‘i will face while fishing for *ulua*. The act of going to a “dark bay” could represent a descent into the spiritual realm or a confrontation with unseen forces.

– Allegorically, this paragraph represents a power struggle between traditional ‘Ai Kapu practices (Puali‘i’s promise) and potential shifts in societal norms. Puali‘i's insistence on consuming the *ulua* head could represent a clinging to old ways, while Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s connection to the land could symbolize a new generation challenging those traditions. The “others” represent the wider community caught in this conflict, potentially influencing the outcome. This paragraph sets the stage for a deeper exploration of these themes in subsequent chapters, hinting at a potential dismantling or reinterpretation of ‘Ai Kapu practices within the narrative.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo‘o's body at that time was very small, two feet and a half tall, he wasn’t strong, but rather slender. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, he told the children, “Tear out all the vines and leaves completely, don’t leave any to grow.” But the children were afraid, so they cautiously touched the sweet potatoes, not tearing out any vines.","**Paragraph 5:**• This paragraph marks a significant shift in the narrative, with Puali‘i’s failure at fishing serving as a catalyst for Nāmakaokapāo‘o's actions. The introduction of seventeen children is noteworthy, suggesting a collective agency and potentially foreshadowing further events. The description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s diminutive stature is crucial, contrasting his physical weakness with the destructive command he issues. The children's fear and reluctance to obey highlight a moral tension within the scene.

– **Puali‘i’s Failure:** The opening statement, “Puali‘i failed at fishing,” is deceptively simple. In traditional Hawaiian cosmology, success in resource acquisition (fishing being paramount) often reflects spiritual alignment and reciprocity with the natural world. Puali‘i’s failure could symbolize a disruption in this balance, perhaps due to his own actions or beliefs. This sets the stage for Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s intervention, which may be interpreted as an attempt to restore this balance or exploit the existing disruption.

– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s Physicality:** The description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as “two feet and a half tall” is significant. This diminutive stature emphasizes his vulnerability but also potentially masks his cunning or influence. The qualifier “he wasn’t strong, but rather slender” further reinforces this contrast. This physical description is likely allegorical, representing a force that appears weak but possesses hidden power or agency. The name *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o* (the eyes of the pāo’o fish) is also relevant. – *Pāo'o* (pāo’o fish) often symbolizes a head or face, and *maka* (eyes) represent perception and knowledge. Thus, Nāmakaokapāo‘o could be interpreted as a figure who “sees” or understands something that others do not.

– **The Seventeen Children:** The number seventeen is intriguing and likely holds symbolic weight. In traditional Hawaiian numerology, numbers often represent specific deities or concepts. While a definitive interpretation requires further research, seventeen could be associated with *Lono*, the god of agriculture and fertility. The children’s collective presence suggests a potential for growth or renewal, but their fear indicates that this potential is currently suppressed.

– **The Command to Destroy:** Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s command, “Tear out all the vines and leaves completely, don’t leave any to grow,” is overtly destructive. This act directly contradicts the principles of sustainable agriculture and resource management that were central to traditional Hawaiian culture. The command could be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to undermine the existing system or exploit Puali‘i’s failure. This act is particularly resonant when considered in the context of the 'Ai Kapu era, where specific crops held ritual significance and were often subject to strict regulations. The destruction of the sweet potato patches could symbolize a rejection of these traditional practices or an attempt to usurp their power.

– **The Children’s Fear:** The children's fear and reluctance to obey highlight a moral tension within the scene. Their hesitation suggests that they recognize the destructive nature of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s command and are unwilling to participate in it. This resistance could be interpreted as a symbol of hope or a foreshadowing of future conflict. The act of “cautiously touching” the sweet potatoes suggests a reverence for life and a reluctance to cause harm. This aligns with traditional Hawaiian values of *mālama* (caring for) and *aloha* (love and compassion).

– **Allegorical Interpretation:** The entire scene can be interpreted as an allegory for the disruption of traditional Hawaiian culture and the rise of new forces. Puali‘i represents the old order, struggling to maintain his livelihood and spiritual alignment. Nāmakaokapāo‘o represents the new forces, exploiting the existing weaknesses and challenging the established norms. The seventeen children represent the potential for renewal, but their fear indicates that this potential is currently suppressed. The destruction of the sweet potato patches symbolizes the undermining of traditional practices and the rise of new ideologies. This interpretation is further strengthened by the context of historical events, such as the arrival of Western missionaries and the subsequent decline of traditional Hawaiian culture. The scene could be seen as a warning against the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of preserving traditional values.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

He tore apart both sweet potato patches until there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty mounds in all from the two patches. Then Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather came back and reached him and asked Nāmakaokapāo‘o's mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said, ""No."" Puali‘i said, ""Yes, his head and eyes are what will go with my sweet potatoes today. Therefore, today is the day he will die for me.""","**Paragraph 6:**• This paragraph details a significant escalation of conflict and reveals Pua-li'i’s intent to harm Nāmakaokapāo‘o. The actions described are symbolic and likely represent a dismantling of traditional resource management practices, coupled with an allegorical threat to the protagonist. The numbers referenced – 2, 4, and 40 – are key to understanding the deeper meaning of this passage.

– **Destruction of the ‘Uala Patches:** Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s relentless tearing apart of the sweet potato patches (māla ‘uala) is not simply an act of childish rebellion. The ‘uala (sweet potato) held immense cultural and practical significance in ancient Hawai'i, serving as a staple food source and playing a role in ceremonial offerings. The act of destroying the patches represents a deliberate disruption of sustenance and potentially, a rejection of traditional agricultural practices. The repetition – “ā pau kekahi māla ‘uala ā luna o kekahi māla ‘uala” (tearing apart each sweet potato patch upon another) – emphasizes the thoroughness of this destruction.

– **The Significance of Numbers:** The numbers 2, 4, and 40 are not arbitrary.
    – **Two (2):** Likely represents duality – the two sweet potato patches, perhaps symbolizing opposing forces or perspectives. It could also allude to the parentage of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, with two primary caregivers (Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i).
    – **Four (4):** A sacred number in Hawaiian cosmology, often associated with the four major gods: Kāne, Kū, Lono, and Kanaloa. The four sweet potato vines being broiled could represent a sacrifice or offering to these deities, albeit in a distorted manner. It also represents the four cardinal directions and the completeness of the universe.
    – **Forty (40):** A number often associated with periods of trial, purification, or transformation. The forty mounds of sweet potato leaves could symbolize a period of hardship or cleansing that must be endured. It also represents the 40 days and nights of rain during the creation story, a period of significant change.

– **Broiling the Vines (ʻŌhinu):** The act of broiling the sweet potato vines (ʻau o ka ‘uala) is particularly telling. “ʻŌhinu” implies a wilting or scorching process, suggesting the destruction of potential growth and vitality. This is not simply cooking; it’s a deliberate act of rendering something unusable. The fire pit (kapuahi) further emphasizes the sacredness – and potential danger – of this act. The kapuahi was a central element in ancient Hawaiian religious practices, often used for sacrifices and offerings.

– **Pua-li'i’s Intent:** Puali‘i’s response – “‘A‘ole.” ‘Ī aku ‘o Puali‘i: “‘Ae, ‘o ke po‘o ona a me nā maka ka mea e ‘īna‘i ai ku‘u ‘uala i kēia lā, no laila, eia kona lā e make ai ia‘u.” (No. Yes, his head and eyes are what will go with my sweet potatoes today. Therefore, today is the day he will die for me.) – reveals his true intent: to harm Nāmakaokapāo‘o. The statement is chillingly direct, framing Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a sacrifice to accompany his meal.

– **The Symbolic Consumption:** The phrase “e ‘īna‘i ai ku‘u ‘uala” (to go with my sweet potatoes) is deeply symbolic. In the 'Ai Kapu era, human sacrifice was sometimes practiced to ensure a bountiful harvest or appease the gods. The ulua fish often served as a substitute for human sacrifice, representing the life force that was offered to the deities. Puali‘i’s statement suggests he intends to consume Nāmakaokapāo‘o – or at least, his life force – along with his sweet potatoes. This is a perversion of the traditional practice, framing Nāmakaokapāo‘o as an offering to satisfy his own hunger.

– **Name Etymology and Allegorical Meaning:**
    – **Pua-li'i (-a)li’i (child/descendant of a chief):** The name suggests lineage and potential power. However, his actions betray a lack of true leadership and a willingness to resort to violence.
    – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo'o fish):** The name is crucial. “Nā maka” (the eyes) represent perception, knowledge, and insight. The “pāo'o” fish is a deep-sea fish known for its large eyes and ability to see in the dark. This suggests Nāmakaokapāo‘o possesses a unique understanding of the world – perhaps an awareness of the injustices and inequalities that exist within it. The threat to his “maka” (eyes) is therefore a threat to his ability to see the truth.

– **Allegorical Interpretation:** This passage likely represents a conflict between traditional values and destructive forces. Nāmakaokapāo‘o embodies the potential for positive change, while Puali‘i represents a clinging to outdated and harmful practices. The destruction of the ‘uala patches symbolizes a rejection of sustainable resource management, while the threat to Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s life represents a suppression of knowledge and insight. The passage foreshadows a coming struggle between these opposing forces, with the fate of the land hanging in the balance.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw this and ran to stand far away out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Behold! The knife is in my hand, it’s a thing to cut off your head today, and your head will be severed, then cooked with the sweet potato, and I will eat it first, and then it will be free (noa).” Nāmakaokapāo‘o didn’t listen to these words of Puali‘i, and then Puali‘i spoke again – it was the second time. Puali‘i prepared to cut Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the knife, at which time Nāmakaokapāo‘o recited his death chant for Puali‘i. He chanted as follows:
Beloved is the eye of my pāo‘o, O hapupu‘u, you are holding it tight,
Eat perhaps, or leave perhaps,
Leave perhaps Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,
Nākukui‘aimakaokalani is that one,
That one is my beloved companion,
Nāmakaokai‘a the high chief of Hawai‘i,
Slide perhaps, slide the useless one,
A person indeed with a spear,
The spear indeed with a shield,
Die indeed Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","**Paragraph 7:**• This paragraph marks a critical escalation in the conflict between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, culminating in a direct threat of violence and Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s counter-offensive through the recitation of a death chant (oli make). The imagery is stark and symbolic, deeply rooted in Hawaiian cosmology and social practices. – Puali‘i’s possession of the ko‘ilipi (knife) is not merely a physical act but represents his assertion of power and intent to break the kapu (sacred law) by taking a life. The repetition of “eia” (“behold!”) emphasizes the gravity of the situation and serves as a warning. The children’s reaction – fleeing in fear – highlights the perceived danger of Puali‘i and his disregard for traditional protocols.

• The name Nāmakaokapāo‘o continues to be significant. – Nā-maka (eyes) references sight, perception, and knowledge; - o-ka (of the); - pāo‘o (pāo‘o fish). The pāo‘o fish is a deep-sea fish known for its large eyes and association with darkness, suggesting Nāmakaokapāo‘o possesses hidden knowledge or foresight. The name itself is a declaration of his identity and potentially a source of his power.

• Puali‘i’s threat to “cook” and “eat” Nāmakaokapāo‘o's head is a deeply disturbing act that echoes the practices of the 'Ai Kapu era. – In ancient Hawai'i, human sacrifice (kanu) was sometimes practiced to ensure fertility, success in warfare, or appease the gods. The head (po‘o) was considered a sacred part of the body, containing mana (spiritual power). The act of eating it would symbolically absorb that power. However, Puali‘i’s intent is not necessarily religious; it appears to be an act of revenge and dominance. The phrase “noa” (free, released) suggests a desire to break the kapu associated with death and consumption.

• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s response – reciting his oli make – is a powerful act of defiance and counter-magic. The chant itself reveals crucial information about his lineage, identity, and worldview. – “Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o” (Beloved is the eye of my pāo‘o) reaffirms his connection to his namesake and source of power. “Hapupu‘u” is a term referencing the mouth, suggesting an invocation to consume or absorb power. The repeated phrase “E waiho paha” (Leave perhaps) is a plea for release or mercy, but also a subtle attempt to weaken Puali‘i’s resolve.

• The name Nākukui‘aimakaokalani is particularly revealing. – Nā-kuku-i (descendant of a chief/chiefly line); - ai (to eat/consume); - maka-o-ka-lani (eyes of the heavens). This name suggests a lineage connected to high chiefs and divine knowledge. The invocation of Nākukui‘aimakaokalani could be a plea to ancestors for protection or intervention. The reference to “ku‘u wahi aikāne” (that one is my beloved companion) suggests a close relationship, possibly romantic or familial.

• The final lines – “O Nāmakaokai‘a ke ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i” (Nāmakaokai‘a the high chief of Hawai‘i) – are a declaration of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s own high status. The reference to “ihe” (spear) and “pahu” (shield) signifies his warrior prowess. The repetition of “Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (Die indeed Nāmakaokapāo‘o) is a final curse, but also a subtle attempt to reverse the spell and inflict death upon Puali‘i.

• Allegorically, this paragraph represents a clash between traditional 'Ai Kapu practices and emerging progressive thinking. Puali‘i embodies the old ways – a willingness to resort to violence, disregard for kapu, and belief in human sacrifice. Nāmakaokapāo‘o represents a new generation – one that values lineage, knowledge, and defiance of oppressive systems. The oli make is a powerful weapon – not necessarily to inflict physical harm, but to challenge Puali‘i’s worldview and ultimately dismantle the old order. The entire scene can be interpreted as a symbolic struggle for the future of Hawai'i, with Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing a path towards liberation and self-determination.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

Crucially, they are now “involved” (komo) in the prayer (pule) of Nā-makaokapāo‘o, suggesting a significant shift in the narrative and potentially foreshadowing conflict or manipulation. The use of “komo” is telling, implying an active participation rather than passive observation;

– **Name Etymology & Significance:** Both names share the root “Nā-maka,” meaning ""eyes"" or ""sight."" This is a common naming convention in Hawaiian culture, often referencing lineage, spiritual insight, or prophetic abilities. However, the suffixes differentiate their roles and potential destinies:
    • **Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (Eyes of the Heavens):** “Ka-lani” refers to the heavens, sky, or paradise. This name suggests a connection to the divine realm, ancestral spirits (akua), and perhaps a role as spiritual leaders or keepers of ancient knowledge. The name could also allude to the *Kahuna ‘Ōlolo*, priests who practiced divination by observing the stars and clouds.
    • **Nāmaka-o-kai‘a (Eyes of the Sea):** “Kai‘a” refers to the sea, ocean, or saltwater. This name suggests a connection to the earthly realm, the power of the ocean (mana), and potentially a role as warriors or navigators. The sea in Hawaiian cosmology is often seen as the source of life and a powerful force to be reckoned with. The name could also allude to *Kahuna Kai*, priests who practiced divination by observing the ocean currents and marine life.
– **Lineage & Social Hierarchy:** The description of these characters as *ali'i nui* is important. This denotes a high rank within the Hawaiian social hierarchy, likely indicating they held significant political and religious power. The father-child relationship further establishes a clear line of succession and potentially highlights the importance of maintaining social order. The fact that they are from Hawai'i Island is also significant, as this island was traditionally considered the most powerful and influential in the archipelago.
– **The Prayer & Potential Manipulation:** The involvement of Nā-maka-o-ka-lani and Nā-maka-o-kai‘a in the prayer of Nā-makaokapāo‘o is a pivotal moment. Given the destructive behavior already exhibited by Nā-makaokapāo‘o (tearing apart sweet potato patches), it is likely that this prayer is not benevolent. It could be a spell, incantation (hana ‘ana‘ana), or ritual designed to gain power, control others, or even cause harm. The use of “komo” suggests they are actively participating in this potentially dangerous act, raising questions about their motives and allegiances.
– **Allegorical Interpretation & the ‘Ai Kapu Era:** Considering the context of the narrative, it is possible that these characters represent forces within the traditional Hawaiian system (the ‘Ai Kapu era) being corrupted or manipulated by Nā-makaokapāo‘o. The ‘Ai Kapu system was characterized by strict social hierarchies, powerful priests (kahuna), and complex rituals designed to maintain order. Nā-makaokapāo‘o, with his destructive behavior and manipulative tactics, could be seen as a force challenging this system. The involvement of the *ali'i nui* in his prayer could symbolize the erosion of traditional authority and the rise of a new, potentially dangerous power. The names themselves could be allegorical: Nā-maka-o-ka-lani representing the fading power of the heavens and Nā-maka-o-kai‘a representing the earthly forces being drawn into his web. The prayer itself could be a metaphor for the disruption of the natural order and the abandonment of ancient values. This paragraph, therefore, sets the stage for a potential conflict between tradition and change, with potentially devastating consequences.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p9,1,9,"A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o, i ia wā i  ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o, e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i  iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē.

The head of Puali‘i replied to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Greetings, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o grabbed the head of Puali‘i and threw it into the ocean at Waipouli, a hole on the shore of Honouliuli, its length five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• This paragraph marks a pivotal moment in the narrative, signifying a symbolic death and rebirth. The act of cutting the coconut (niu) onto Nāmakaokapāo‘o is not a random act of violence, but rather a ritualistic severing. The coconut itself holds deep cultural significance in Hawaiian cosmology and daily life, representing sustenance, protection, and the cyclical nature of life. – The niu is often associated with *Kū*, the god of war and male potency, suggesting a challenge to Puali‘i’s authority or perhaps an attempt to transfer power. The act of cutting the niu *onto* Nāmakaokapāo‘o, rather than simply handing it to him, is crucial. It implies a forced transfer of something vital, possibly knowledge or mana (spiritual power).

• The speaking head is a clear indication of supernatural intervention and the dismemberment of Puali‘i’s physical form. This is not merely a decapitation; it's the separation of intellect and spirit from the body. – The head, in Hawaiian tradition, represents *po‘o*, the source of wisdom, genealogy (mo‘oku‘āhuna ‘ōiwi), and decision-making. The fact that it speaks independently suggests a continuation of Puali‘i’s consciousness, albeit in a fragmented form. The greeting (“Aloha ‘oe”) is ironic; it’s a conventional expression of respect, but delivered from a severed head. This could be interpreted as Puali‘i acknowledging Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s power, or a final attempt to communicate something important.

• The name *Puali‘i* is interesting and likely holds allegorical meaning. – *Pua-* (flower, blossom) suggests beauty, youth, and potential, while *-li‘i* could relate to *li‘ili‘i*, small or insignificant. This suggests a character who appears harmless but possesses hidden strength or influence. The name could also allude to the concept of *pua‘a*, pigs, which were central to the ‘Ai Kapu system as offerings and sources of sustenance. This connection reinforces the idea that Puali‘i represents a traditional worldview rooted in sacrifice and ritualistic practices.

• The act of throwing the head into the ocean at Waipouli is a symbolic return to the source. – *Kai* (ocean) represents creation, abundance, and the realm of the gods. Waipouli, described as a hole five miles long, is not merely a geographical location; it’s a portal or abyss. The length of the hole could represent the vastness of the unknown, or the depth of Puali‘i’s knowledge and influence. This act could be interpreted as a release of power back into the natural world, or a burial of the old ways.

• The location of Honouliuli (“dark bay”) is also significant. – *Hono-* (recess, cove) suggests a sheltered place, while *-uli* (dark) implies mystery and the unseen. This location could represent a transition zone between the physical world and the spirit realm, or a place where ancient knowledge is hidden. The overall context suggests that Puali‘i’s head is being returned to the source of creation, where it will continue to exert influence.

• Considering the broader narrative context, this paragraph likely represents a dismantling of the ‘Ai Kapu system and a shift towards a more progressive worldview. – Puali‘i, as a representative of the old ways, is being sacrificed to make way for Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s new vision. The act of throwing the head into the ocean could be interpreted as a symbolic rejection of human sacrifice and a return to natural principles. The length of the hole could represent the vastness of the potential for change, or the depth of the knowledge that is being released. The entire scene could be interpreted as an allegorical representation of a cultural revolution, where the old ways are being replaced by new ones. The 'Ai Kapu era was characterized by strict social hierarchies and ritualistic practices, including human sacrifice. This paragraph suggests a rejection of these practices and a move towards a more egalitarian society.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
