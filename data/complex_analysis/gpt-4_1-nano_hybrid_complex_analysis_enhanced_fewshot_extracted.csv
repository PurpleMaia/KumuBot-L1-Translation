His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa and was partly divine (a demigod).""","• **Paragraph 1 Analysis:**

• The opening sentence introduces the primary figure, **Nāmakaokapāo'o**, highlighting essential aspects typical of Hawaiian storytelling:
   – **Naming and attributes:**  
     • **“He keiki ‘u‘uku loa”** (a very small child): In Hawaiian culture, particularly in legend and genealogy, names often carry descriptive or symbolic meanings. While *keiki* means *child*, *‘u‘u‘u‘u‘u‘u‘u‘u* emphasizes the smallness or youth, yet the phrase “loa” (very) underscores his significance.  
     • **Nāmakaokapāo'o:**  
       – *Nāmaka* refers to the goddess of the ocean or a sea spirit, suggesting a divine or supernatural connotation, as it translates to “eyes of the pāo'o fish,” symbolizing sharpness and insight. *Kapāo'o* may be a poetic or mythic epithet, possibly linked to references of fish or water creatures, emphasizing his connection to the ocean, which is central in Hawaiian identity and mythology.  
   – **Physical strength and bravery in youth:**  
     • “a he keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio” — “an extremely strong boy when he was young”: In Hawaiian culture, strength and bravery are virtues highly esteemed, especially in chiefs and legendary figures. Their strength often symbolizes spiritual power or divine favor rather than mere physical ability.

• **Geographical and genealogical context:**

– *“‘A‘ohe ona lua ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau,”*  
  • This phrase emphasizes the uniqueness and exceptional nature of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s qualities across the Hawaiian archipelago, from Hawai‘i island to Ni‘ihau. It underscores that no one else among the islands matches his small stature and valor, suggesting a legendary status that transcends specific locales.

– **Place names and kinship:**

– *“‘O Kauluakaha‘i, kona makua kāne,”* (Kauluakaha‘i, his father):  
  • The name *Kauluakaha'i* is complex—“Kau-” often referencing a standing or long-lasting foundation; *lua* (meaning “two”or “twice”) and *kaha'i* (which may derive from roots meaning strength or divine power). The name implies resilience or strength, fitting for a chief or divine ancestor.  
  • **Genealogy** is central in Hawaiian tradition: genealogies establish mana (spiritual power) and social status. Emphasizing his father links Nāmakaokapāo'o to a noble line.

– *“no Kahikipapaialewa, he ‘āina i Kahikinu‘u,”*  
  • *Kahikipapaialewa* appears as a place name, which in Hawaiian is often a genealogical or mythic locus. The phrase “he ‘āina i Kahikinu'u” signifies land or territory in Kahikinu'u, possibly a sacred site or mythic location associated with divine or ancestral stories.

– *“‘O Pōka‘ī ka makuahine,”* (Pōka‘ī was his mother):  
  • The maternal line is also noted, emphasizing genealogical importance. *Pōka‘i* might carry specific familial or divine connotations, as many Hawaiian names are tied to genealogical or ancestral attributes.

– **Father’s high rank and divine aspect:**

– *“He ali‘i nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa,”*  
  • “High chief” (*ali‘i nui*) indicates a ruling aristocratic or chiefly status, reinforcing the generated mana and divine right associated with his family.

– *“a he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona,”*  
  • This phrase—“he ‘ao‘ao akua” meaning “he is partly divine”—is key: it reveals that Kauluakaha'i’s lineage is a mixture of mortal and divine elements, a common characteristic in Hawaiian chiefly lines, who often claim descent from gods or demi-gods.  
  • The “‘ao‘ao akua” (divine side) may also symbolize spiritual power or divine favor passed down through generations, essential for leadership and legitimacy in Hawaiian society.

**Overall cultural insights:**
- The passage illustrates the Hawaiian value placed on genealogy, divine descent, and ancestral land ties; these are crucial for understanding one’s identity, mana, and legitimacy as a leader or hero.
- The name conventions and references to places like Kahikipapaialewa and Kahikinu‘u evoke sacred sites, linking the individual to the land’s spiritual essence— a core principle in Hawaiian worldview: *'Aina (land) is family and kin*.
- The embedding of divine qualities, through whether a ancestor is “part divine,” reflects Hawaiian cosmology, where spiritual power is hereditary and vital for hero figures.
- The emphasis on physical strength and unique qualities underscores the Hawaiian ideal that true mana manifests through both lineage and personal attributes, fostering respect and awe.

This passage exemplifies the rich interconnectedness of genealogy, land, spirituality, and moral virtues in Hawaiian tradition, which are always intertwined in noble narratives and leadership legacies.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97).

The core themes revolve around notions of power, divine authority, kinship, and cultural resilience, as well as allegorical representations of political authority and opposition. Nāmakaokapāo'o’s lineage—son of the semi-divine high chief Kauluakaha'i from Kahikipapaialewa and Pōka'i—positions him within a sacred genealogical framework that underscores the importance of chiefly origins, divinity, and ancestral authority in Hawaiian mythological thought.

The narrative's setting—intertwined with specific locations such as Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa, and the land of Kahikipapaialewa—establishes a geographically and culturally contextualized landscape that reflects traditional Hawaiian territorial sovereignty. The mention of Kahikipapaialewa, a land associated with chiefly landholding and divine descent, and Puali‘i’s fishing at Honouliuli, highlights essential aspects of land stewardship and resource management intrinsic to Hawaiian socio-political life. The detailed focus on the sweet potato patches ('Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s patches') symbolizes sustenance, the foundational produce of Native Hawaiian agriculture, and the spiritual connection between land, food, and community.

Within this mythos, Nāmakaokapāo'o’s nascent strength and bravery are emphasized through his early youth, underlining themes of innate nobility and divine favor. The conflict with Puali‘i, his stepfather and antagonist, employs allegorical motifs reflecting cultural tensions: the small but fiercely brave hero defies the authority of a larger, more conventionally powerful figure, symbolizing resistance and resilience of indigenous sovereignty in the face of external dominance. Puali‘i’s depiction as a traditional antagonist seeking to kill Nāmakaokapāo'o—whose body and head are conjoined with divine prayer and ceremonial demise—mirrors archetypal patterns of conflict between native authority and foreign intrusion, with the act of the hero's death echoing struggles over land, sovereignty, and cultural integrity.

The narrative's depiction of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s death, where his spirit responds after being slain and then continues to exercise influence, resonates with themes of heroism, eternal remembrance, and the spiritual continuity of chiefly lineage—elements vital in Hawaiian moʻolelo (stories). The subsequent intervention of ‘Ama‘u, a chief from O‘ahu, and the ensuing battles, symbolize resistance against conquest, echoing historical themes of warfare, political hegemony, and the assertion of chiefly and divine authority. The repeated references to strategic locations—Waipouli, Keahumoa, Waikīkī—and the involvement of war canoes and fighters evoke the traditional Polynesian art of warfare and territorial defense.

The chapter's allegorical framework is ripe for interpretation within broader historical contexts, particularly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The myth could serve as a symbolic critique of colonization, depicting a small but indomitable native hero confronting external threats—be they political, cultural, or spiritual. The hero’s divine genealogy and heroic feats may be read as an assertion of indigenous sovereignty, contrasting with what historical records suggest—an increased marginalization of Hawaiian cultural symbols under Western influence and American annexation efforts. The depiction of internal conflict and external invasion echoes Hawaiian nationalist sentiments, subtly resisting narratives of subjugation by emphasizing ancestral greatness and divine legitimacy.

From a literary standpoint, this myth functions as a layered allegory embodying Hawaiian values—mana (spiritual power), kuleana (responsibility), and ʻohana (family/kinship)—while also serving as a rhetorical device to reinforce cultural pride amid a period of political upheaval. Its archetypal characters—Nāmakaokapāo'o as the hero, Puali‘i as the antagonist, and ‘Ama‘u as the defender—reflect universal motifs that facilitate cultural continuity and identity maintenance in Hawaiian oral and written traditions.

In synthesis, this chapter encapsulates a myth that intertwines genealogical, geographical, and spiritual elements to reinforce notions of native sovereignty and divine authority. Its detailed setting and characterizations function as allegories for resistance and resilience, contextualized within the specific political and cultural landscapes of Hawai‘i’s history—especially amidst colonization and cultural suppression post-1893. The timing of its transmission—potentially during the colonization era—suggests it may embody a subtly coded form of cultural activism, reclaiming indigenous narratives to uphold identity and sovereignty. Ultimately, this story exemplifies how Hawaiian mythic traditions serve both as cultural memory and tools of political symbolism, ensuring the perpetual vitality of native identity in the face of external geopolitical pressures."

Pōka‘ī remained there with her carrying, and afterward, she gave birth. From this birth, she and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were extremely thin and emaciated.","• Paragraph Analysis:
  – The passage opens by establishing the geographic and cultural setting, ‘O Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa, which is a significant region in western Oahu, historically known for its coastal communities and subsistence-based lifestyle. The phrase ""ka ‘āina"" (the land) emphasizes the importance of place in Hawaiian identity and storytelling—places are often recorded as living entities that witness events and relationships.
  
  – The phrase ""la LAua i launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" highlights an intimate encounter (""launa kino"") and a sleeping or resting state, indicating a moment of closeness or union. The wording suggests a significant intimate meeting that results in the conception of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, anchoring him in the land and the ancestral landscape.
  
  – The action ""hāpai ‘o Pōka‘ī iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" (Pōka‘ī bore or carried Nāmakaokapāo‘o) signifies her pregnancy and the physical act associated with childbirth, framing her as a maternal figure connected to the land—possibly symbolizing fertility and continuation of the lineage.
  
  – The return of Kauluakaha‘i to his land emphasizes a cyclical or hierarchical pattern in Hawaiian storytelling—individuals return to their territories or origins, strengthening land-identity bonds and ancestral ties.
  
  – The phrase ""noho ihola ‘o Pōka‘ī me kona hāpai"" (Pōka‘ī remained there with her carrying) reflects a period of gestation and waiting, common in Hawaiian narratives, where the land and the woman’s body are intertwined as the site of gestation and future progeny.
  
  – The culmination in ""hānau"" (birth) and the description of both Pōka‘ī and her child being ""ilihune loa"" (very thin, emaciated) is significant:
  – In Hawaiian cultural context, especially during the ‘Ai Kapu era, birth and physicality often symbolize broader themes of sacrifice, hardship, and spiritual renewal. “Emaciation” may metaphorically represent trials faced, the austerity of the land, or the spiritual sacrifices involved in lineage and survival.
  
• Name and Cultural Significance:
  – The names “Pōka‘ī,” “Nāmakaokapāo‘o,” and “Kauluakaha‘i” can be examined for their meanings:
  – **‘O Pōka‘ī** — ‘O’ often indicates a personal name; “Pō” (night) combined with “ka‘ī” (possibly derived from “‘ī,” meaning to press or to cause to inherit) may evoke darkness or concealment, perhaps symbolizing hidden origins or spiritual depth.
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** — “Nā maka o ka pāo’o” (the eyes of the pāo’o fish): As in the examples, the 'maka' (eyes) often symbolize insight, perception, or a divine or ancestral gaze; the pāo’o fish, representing sacred or significant creatures in Hawaiian lore, might symbolize awareness or spiritual vision necessary for future leadership or understanding.
  – **Kauluakaha‘i** — “Ka ulu a kaha‘i” (the growth/trunk of Kaha‘i): The root “ka ulu” (the growth) is a common metaphor for lineage, birth, or development, while “kaha‘i” (possibly meaning ‘to grow strong or to be fearless’) evokes strength and resilience, traits revered in Hawaiian chiefs and warriors.
• Cultural and Mythological Context:
  – The physical emaciation of Pōka‘ī and her child in the story echoes themes of sacrifice and hardship prevalent in Hawaiian mythology, where characters often endure trials that forge their spiritual strength.
  – The narrative also highlights the importance of land, genealogy, and divine or ancestral connections—core to Hawaiian cosmology—where individuals’ well-being directly reflects their relationship to land and ancestors.
  – The mention of the place ‘O Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa underscores the significance of place as a living, sacred locus where key ancestral events unfold, reinforcing the Hawaiian worldview that land and genealogy are inseparable.
• Summary of Cultural Themes:
  – The passage encapsulates themes of union, land-based origins, pregnancy, hardship, and the interconnectedness of land, family, and spirituality—fundamental elements in Hawaiian storytelling and cultural worldview. It emphasizes land as witness to and participant in human events, and underscores the resilience and spiritual symbolism associated with birth and hardship in Hawaiian cultural narratives.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

  – This passage describes a typical interaction during a Hawaiian social setting, emphasizing the customary openness and hospitality of the land and its people during the pre-contact and early contact eras (notably the 'Ai Kapu era).  
  – The story involves harmony between two individuals—Puali‘i, a good man from Līhu‘e, and Pōka‘ī—and their engagement in a courtship, culminating in their union at Keahumoa, a significant location in Līhu‘e, possibly indicating a sacred or strategic place.

• **Character and Place Names:**  
  – **Puali‘i:** The name possibly derives from ""pua,"" meaning ""flower,"" and the honorific “-li‘i,” which is associated with nobility or descent. As a character introduced here, he embodies the archetype of a noble or respectful suitor—""beautiful flower"" or ""noble flower."" His origin from Līhu‘e (a major and historically significant town on Kaua‘i) establishes his status and cultural roots.  
  – **Pōka‘ī:** The name contains ""Po"" (night) and ""ka‘i"" (to rise or ascend). It could metaphorically suggest ""the rise of night"" or ""evening coming forth,"" possibly indicating her role in the community or her character’s traits of reserve or mystery. Her initial hesitation due to having a child and feeling unworthy reflects traditional Hawaiian values of kuleana (responsibility) and cultural standards of appearance and worthiness in relationships.

• **Customs and Cultural Practices:**  
  – The narrative reflects a practice of courtship and agreement without direct mention of formal protocols such as oli (chants) or rituals, but the tone and context imply acceptance rooted in mutual understanding and respect—core Hawaiian values.  
  – The dialogue exemplifies the laid-back but sincere approach to romantic relationships typical of the early social periods, where personal qualities and mutual respect were paramount.

• **Psychological and Cultural Significance of the Dialogue:**  
  – Puali‘i’s declaration, “Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u,” embodies straightforwardness and honesty valued in Hawaiian courtship, contrasting with more elaborate protocols observed during formal alliances or ali’i (noble) courtship.  
  – Pōka‘ī’s response, questioning her worth (""Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino""), reveals societal expectations placed on women regarding appearance and the importance of physical and social propriety. Her feeling of shame or inadequacy highlights the tensions women might have felt, especially those who had child-rearing responsibilities and possibly less social standing.

• **Allegorical and Sociocultural Layers:**  
  – The act of 'mōkūā (acceptance) and the couple’s union at Keahumoa symbolize the continuation of social cohesion and familial alliances, emphasizing kinship ties, which are central in Hawaiian society.  
  – Their union signifies more than just a partnership; it reflects the interconnectedness of land, identity, and lineage, where relationships reinforce social structure and community stability.

• **Historical and Ethical Implications:**  
  – The passage subtly advocates for genuine love and acceptance regardless of societal expectations or personal circumstances.  
  – It subtly counters the importance placed on outward appearance and status, advocating instead for mutual respect and sincerity—values deeply rooted in Hawaiian culture and possibly contrasting later periods in Hawaiian history with more stratified social norms.

• **Conclusion:**  
  – This brief dialogue encapsulates core Hawaiian principles: the value of humility, the importance of respect, and the communal approach to personal relationships.  
  – The setting at Keahumoa and the characters’ interactions exemplify traditional social harmony, emphasizing that enduring relationships are built on sincerity, mutual respect, and a shared connection to land and community.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

When the sweet potatoes matured, Puali'i recited a vow: “When the head of the ulua fish and the sweet potato are roasted together, I will eat my fill, then my wife, Pōka'ī, and others will also eat.” Accordingly, Puali'i went to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for 'i'a (fish) to eat along with the sweet potatoes.","• Paragraph 4 presents a scene where Puali'i is engaged in both long-term cultivation and eventual ritual or symbolic action:  
  – He is sitting at his cultivated sweet potato patches ( māla ʿuala ), which he has planted and tended, emphasizing Hawaiian agricultural practices and the importance of taro and sweet potato cultivation, central to sustenance and social stability in traditional society.  
  – The multiple māla ʿuala, noted as “two and more,” suggest either a significant investment or widespread cultivation, indicating Puali'i's prosperity or strategic resource management. The phrase “which remain to this day” (ā hiki i kēia lā) hints at the lasting significance of his effort, perhaps symbolizing legacy or continuity in land use.  
  – The invocation of the name Nāmakaokapāo'o's patches connects the scene to the mythic figure introduced earlier—implying that these patches are not mere agricultural plots but are linked to divine or mythic authority, possibly symbolizing ancestral land or the sacredness of the land itself.  
• The vow recited by Puali'i — “When the head of the ulua and the sweet potato are roasted together” — serves multiple cultural and symbolic functions:  
  – In Hawaiian tradition, ulua (Giant Trevally) fish are considered a sacred, high-status fish, often associated with strong mana (divine power). Roasting ulua head and sweet potato together might symbolize harmony between aquatic and terrestrial resources, a metaphor for balance between different elements of land and sea, or the integration of gods' blessings into daily life.  
  – The vow indicates a ritualistic or symbolic act of gratitude or alliance with the natural and divine order, and the act of “eating one’s fill” signifies fulfillment, abundance, and success.  
  – The subsequent mention that “my wife, Pōka'ī, and others will also eat” emphasizes communal sharing and the importance of family, kinship, and social cohesion in Hawaiian culture—food being a central element in Hawai'i's communal and spiritual life.  
• The final sentence, where Puali'i goes to Honouliuli to fish (‘ī'a), highlights traditional subsistence practices:  
  – Before modern commerce, fishing was a vital part of everyday sustenance and a cultural act connected to respect for the ocean and its creatures.  
  – This act complements his agricultural efforts, reflecting a holistic approach to resource use—integrating land and sea—key themes in traditional Hawaiian life and worldview.  
• The narrative’s overall structure emphasizes the interconnectedness of land cultivation, ritual vow, and fishing—each element representing essential aspects of Hawaiian sustenance and spiritual harmony.  
  – The inclusion of a vow underscores the spiritual dimension, where actions are intertwined with divine and ancestral power, reinforcing the cultural importance of covenants with nature and the gods.  
  – The continuity “to this day” (kāhei) sheds light on the deep-rooted value of land, ritual, and resource management, which serve as bedrocks of Hawaiian identity and social life across generations.  
• From a socio-cultural perspective, this passage reflects the customary practices of resource management, spiritual vows—akin to the ‘oli and pule—and the vital role of land, sea, and community in sustaining Hawaiian society.  
  – It also alludes to the importance of land boundaries and naming—such as the specific referencing of Nāmakaokapāo'o's patches—which connect land stewardship with mythic authority, reinforcing the sacred relationship Hawaiian people maintain with their environment.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

At that time, Nā-makaokapāo'o's body was very small, hardly larger than two fists with half of his stature, and he was not affected by any illness, seeming to move freely. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, Nā-makaokapāo'o pointed to the fields and told the children, ""Pull all the leaves and vines of the sweet potatoes here, from the top to the very roots, and do not leave any to grow."" But, frightened of the child, they simply hesitated in the sweet potato patch, not pulling any leaves or vines, and remained quietly still.","• Paragraph 5 provides a vignette rich in cultural nuance and symbolic imagery, involving the character names, physical descriptions, and actions. 
– **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o**: His name translates as ""eyes of the pāo'o"" (a fish), which may carry symbolic implications about perception, insight, or a connection to aquatic life, often associated with knowledge, vision, or a spiritual domain in Hawaiian culture.
– His physical description as “he very small in body, hardly larger than two fists with half his height” emphasizes his diminutive stature, a motif common in Hawaiian mythology where small but powerful characters often symbolize wisdom, agility, or spiritual potency.
– The mention that “he was not affected by any illness and moved freely” hints at a divine or supernatural resilience, aligning with many demigod or mythic figures in Hawaiian tradition who possess extraordinary vitality or health.
– The setting in the sweet potato patches (“māla ‘uala”) highlights the importance of kalo (taro) and sweet potato cultivation, foundational food sources in Hawaiian society, woven into stories of sustenance, land, and communal effort.
• The directive to “pull all the leaves and vines from the top to the roots, without leaving any to grow” reflects traditional Hawaiian agricultural practices and the cultural value of thoroughness and respect towards the land — careful harvesting to ensure continuous fertility.
• The children’s fear and their hesitation (“they simply hesitated in the sweet potato patch, not pulling any leaves or vines”) symbolize the tension between obedience, fear of supernatural authority, and perhaps the recognition of mana (spiritual power) in Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. This reflects customary attitudes in Hawaiian community and kinship relations, where respect for powerful figures, especially children or demigods, constrains behavior.
• Allegorically, this scene may symbolize the balance of natural forces and human actions: the act of harvesting (or withholding) representing the sacred duty of respecting the land’s mana, and the small but potent figure of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o embodying a guardian or divine agent overseeing this balance.
• The fear of the children can be viewed as a metaphor for the respect due to sacred knowledge or divine authority, which dominates their actions and choices—highlighting the Hawaiian worldview that recognizes spiritual power manifesting through land, personages, and natural elements.
• From a broader cultural perspective, this scene might similarly reflect themes from the 'Ai Kapu era, where interactions with supernatural beings or elders required strict adherence to protocol, reverence, and understanding of mana. The story encapsulates a lesson about humility and the recognition of divine sovereignty embedded in everyday life and land relations.
• The passage underscores core values in Hawaiian tradition: the sanctity of land and resources, the influence of spiritual beings, and the importance of respecting and following the guidance of figures embodying mana, whether divine or ancestral. It reveals the interconnectedness of land, person, and spirit through oral storytelling, a vital aspect of cultural transmission and moral education in Hawai'i.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then, Nāmakaokapāo'o returned and lit a fire, broiling four bunches of sweet potatoes on a firepit. As he broiled the sweet potatoes, his stepfather, Kōlea, arrived, came close, and asked his mother, Pōka'ī: ""No."" Puali'i replied: ""Yes, his head and eyes are the food I will eat today, so today he will be killed for me.""","• **Paragraph 6 Analysis:**
  – The scene depicts a crucial, possibly symbolic, act involving the destruction and preparation of sweet potatoes (*ʻuala*), a staple crop in Hawaiian culture. This imagery of tearing up the sweet potato patches (*huhuki*) reflects a moment of intense activity, possibly allegorical of upheaval or transformation.
  – The phrase “noke aku ana” (literally “was busy”) indicates ongoing action, a common storytelling motif emphasizing the work or effort of the character, Nāmakaokapāo'o.
  – The repeated tearing of two patches (*kū ke āhua o ka lau o ka ʻuala*) with approximately forty mounds (*kanahā*), underscores abundance or perhaps a ritualistic or symbolic reordering of resources.

• **Names and Terms:**
  – **Nāmakaokapāo'o**: 
    – *Nāmaka* (eyes, or look/outlook) + *o ka pāo'o* (of the pāo'o fish). The pāo'o fish is an important oceanic symbol, associated with sustenance and the sea. The name may imply a character with penetrating eyesight or a perceptive nature connected to the sea, or metaphorically, a figure involved in observation or oversight.
  – **Kōlea**:
    – Meaning *tern*, a bird associated with travel, transition, or migration in Hawaiian lore. The stepfather's name might symbolize a transitional or guiding figure, possibly connected with movement or change.
  – **Pōka'ī**:
    – *Po* (night) + *ka'ī* (possibly derived from words signifying darkness or a nurturing aspect). Her name may reflect a nocturnal or protective attribute, aligning her role as a maternal figure.

• **The Fire and Broiling Scene:**
  – The act of lighting a fire (*ho‘i a‘ela ke ahi*) and broiling four bundles (*‘ehā ‘au*) of sweet potatoes (*ula*) on a *kapuahi* (a traditional fire alter or stove) is emblematic of a ritual or significant event — perhaps a ceremonial feast or a ritual of sacrifice/consumption.
  – Broiling sweet potatoes can symbolize the preparation of food for a ritual or communal gathering, particularly during periods when offerings and sacrifices were common, such as during the ‘Ai Kapu era, when sacred customs regulated social and spiritual life.

• **Dialogue and Allegorical Meaning:**
  – The stepfather, Kōlea, arriving and asking Pōka'ī whether 'no' (*'A'ole*) indicates refusal or negation, sets a dramatic tone. Her response, “*‘Ae, ‘o ke po‘o ona a me nā maka*” (“Yes, his head and eyes”), signifies a statement of intent to consume or sacrifice, aligning with traditional symbolic language.
  – Puali'i's response: *“‘A‘ole”* (No) followed by a poetic declaration: *“‘O ke po‘o ona a me nā maka ka mea e ‘īna‘i ai ku‘u ‘uala i kēia lā”* (“His head and eyes are the food I will eat today”), is likely allegorical. It hints at themes of sacrifice, consumption, or perhaps a symbolic act of taking something essential from another individual, like the head (po‘o) and eyes (maka), which in Hawaiian thought, can symbolize knowledge, perception, or the soul.

• **Cultural and Historical Context:**
  – During the *‘Ai Kapu* era (a time marked by strict religious and social laws), the act of sacrifice and ritual offerings often involved symbolic language and acts tied to food and spiritual belief.
  – The imagery of cutting or tearing sweet potatoes could symbolize destruction or renewal. The mention of ""heads and eyes"" may reference traditional sacrifice customs where the head (po‘o) and eyes (maka) were kept or offered, reflecting beliefs about the sacredness of these parts.
  – The allegory might critique or reflect on practices of sacrifice, resource redistribution, or spiritual renewal, but in a mythic or exaggerated form, illustrating the tensions between destruction and sustenance.

• **Overall Interpretation:**
  – The scene is rich with symbolism involving sustenance, sacrifice, and transformation. The act of tearing and broiling sweet potatoes represents both physical action and spiritual metaphor.
  – The dialogue reflects underlying themes of conflict, sacrifice, and perhaps a critique or commentary on ritualized violence or consumption, with potential allegories about societal or spiritual change in Hawaiian thinking.
  – The characters’ names and actions echo broader cultural motifs about the cycles of life, death, and renewal, resonating with traditional Hawaiian values centered on harmony with nature and the spiritual worlds.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

Puali'i began to cut the sweet potato stems with his knife and then, upon reaching the middle, he found Nāmakaokapāo'o engaged in stabbing at the four sweet potato vines with his spear, over the fire. He saw all the children at once and swiftly ran and stood at a distance because he was afraid of Puali'i. Then Puali'i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Hey! Here is the knife in my hand, a tool for cutting off your head today, and I will cut your head and roast it with sweet potato, then eat it first, and then everything will be fine."" Nāmakaokapāo'o did not heed Puali’i’s words; instead, he continued to speak again, the second time. Puali'i was prepared to cut off Nāmakaokapāo'o's head with his knife at that moment when Nāmakaokapāo'o was praying his death prayer. It went like this:  
""Kindly be the eyes of my warrior place, Oh, may you float away, may you be wrapped up,  
perhaps eaten, perhaps left behind,  
maybe Nākukui‘aimakaokalani, that is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,

Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is the great chief of Hawaii,  
float away, float away with the spear,  
the spear and the pahu drum,  
die, Nāmakaokapāo'o.""","**Paragraph 7:**  
• The scene depicted is intense and highly symbolic, involving themes of confrontation, ritual, and perhaps death, set against a traditional Hawaiian context of spiritual and physical combat.  
• The act of Puali'i wielding a ‘ko‘ilipi (a cutting implement, presumably a knife or spear) to threaten Nāmakaokapāo'o signifies a moment of mortal conflict, but also echoes traditional Hawaiian notions of struggle, perhaps reflecting allegories of social or divine confrontation.  
• The place of the scene — over the fire, with sweet potatoes ('uala) being cooked — invokes the significance of ‘Ai Kapu practices, where fire and food often symbolize sacred offerings and communal rituals. The ‘uala, as a staple and sacred crop, is central to Hawaiian life, and its connection to rituals of conquest or sacrifice is profound, especially in the context of mythic or ancestral battles.  
• The mention of Nāmakaokapāo'o praying his death prayer adds a layered dimension, blending the physical act of violence with spiritual invocation, aligning with Hawaiian cultural values where death and prayer often intersect in rituals related to warfare, kapu, and spiritual protection.

• The name etymologies and symbolic references include:  
– **Nāmakaokapāo'o:**  
→ ‘Nā Mama’ (the eyes) + ‘ka pāo’o’ (possibly linked to a poetic or mythic phrase). The name may poetically symbolize a vigilant or watchful warrior, with ocular imagery representing vigilance or divine sight.  
– **Puali'i:**  
→ ‘Pu’ (to push or extend) + ‘li’i’ (small, young; descendant or chief, as in ‘li’i’ - little or junior chief). The name implies a youthful leader or someone with royal or noble lineage, fitting for a character engaging in heroic or ritual acts.  
– Our scholarly focus notes that this scene echoes mythic themes of conflict, sacrifice, and spiritual integrity, with the invocation of the prayer showcasing a cultural trait: invoking ancestors or divine forces at moments of peril or death—recurring in Hawaiian mele and mo‘olelo.

• The prayer itself is deeply poetic and reflects the Hawaiian worldview:  
– It expresses a desire for spiritual protection, symbolized through references to sacred places ('Nā Maka-o-ka-pāo'o, Nākukui‘aimakaokalani) and ancestral entities—implying that even in conflict and potential death, spiritual kinship and protection are paramount.  
– The rhythm and repetition (‘ōhene), typical of Hawaiian oratory and chant, serve to reinforce the spiritual significance of the moment—turning a scene of violence into a sacred prayer for divine oversight and protection.

• Overall, this passage intertwines storytelling, ritual, and cultural values—highlighting the importance of spirituality in conflict, the sacredness of food as an offering, and honoring kūpuna and deities in moments of life-and-death struggle. This reflects the broader Hawaiian worldview: a society where spiritual force, kinship, and nature are inseparably linked in every act, including those of confrontation and acceptance of mortality.  
• Historically, such narratives may echo the practices of the 'Ai Kapu era, wherein human sacrifice and sacred rituals often intertwined, but also symbolize the ongoing cultural resilience in storytelling, prayer, and the importance of divine protection in Hawaiian tradition.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

Nāmakaokalani was the father of Nāmakaokai‘a, who was a child of Nāmakaokai‘a. However, he was included in the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","• **Paragraph Overview:**  
  • This passage introduces two significant chiefly figures: Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a.  
  • Their relationship is clarified: Nāmakaokalani is the father of Nāmakaokai‘a, and both are recognized as high chiefs ('ali‘i nui') of Hawai'i.  
  • The mention that Nāmakaokai‘a was a child of Nāmakaokai‘a appears to be a textual or typographical quirk, but it emphasizes their genealogical linkage and chiefly status.  
  • The final remark that Nāmakaokalani was “included in the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o” suggests a spiritual or ritual connection, which might signify honoring ancestral chiefly lines, or integrating divine or spiritual authority through prayer, a common practice in Hawaiian cultural rites.

• **Name Etymology & Cultural Significance:**  
  – *Nāmaka*- means “eyes” or “gaze” (from *nā* ‘the’ and *maka* ‘eyes’).  
  – *Oka-lani*—*lani* meaning “heavenly” or “royal,” so *Nāmakaokalani* could be interpreted as “The Eyes of Heaven” or “The Gaze of the Heavens,” implying a divine or celestial aspect tied to the chiefly authority, possibly signifying oversight or divine vision.  
  – *Nāmakaokai‘a:*  
    – *Nāmaka* as above, and *kai‘a* possibly derived from *kai* ‘food, eating’ with an added element suggesting ‘keeper’ or ‘possessor’.  
    – Alternatively, *kai‘a* could be a contraction or a poetic form, emphasizing a sacred or divine function related to sustenance or spiritual nourishment.  
    – This name may symbolize an ancestral figure associated with providence or spiritual nourishment, reinforcing chiefly responsibility and divine connection.

• **Cultural and Ritual Contexts:**  
  • The mention of “komo i loko o ka pule” (being included in the prayer) highlights the importance of prayer and spiritual invocation in aliʻi traditions.  
  – In the 'Ai Kapu era, prayers and kapu (sacred prohibitions) were central to maintaining the divine order, chiefly mana, and connection to gods.  
  – Incorporating genealogical figures like Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a in prayers indicates that these figures are invoked for spiritual authority or protection, linking the divine ancestry to the living chiefs or the current spiritual practice of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  
  • The context suggests a sacred acknowledgment of chiefly lineage, emphasizing that genealogies are more than family trees—they are intertwined with spiritual authority and divine legitimacy inherent in Hawaiian chiefly culture.

• **Allegorical & Symbolic Implication:**  
  – The passage subtly underscores the importance of ancestral invocation; including sovereign forebears in prayers is a way to legitimize current chiefly authority by connecting it directly to divine or ancestral power.  
  – The phrase “ho‘ōlelo iki” (briefly mention) implies a respect for brevity in sacred communication, a valued aspect during traditional rituals where the focus on divine acknowledgment is paramount.  
  – The phrase also hints at a hierarchy: these chiefly names are of high significance, yet are invoked succinctly to fit into the spiritual discipline, reflecting a deep-seated cultural reverence and strategic use of prayer as a form of spiritual diplomacy and political legitimacy.

• **Historical Reflection:**  
  – This excerpt reflects the continuation of chiefly genealogies into historical memory and ritual practice, illustrating how Hawaiian chiefs maintained their sacred authority through connection to divine ancestors.  
  – The acknowledgment of these figures in prayer reveals a societal system where spiritual and political authority are inseparable, rooted in divine descent and continuous invocation in sacred rituals.

The head was knocked, and Puali‘i spoke to him from a distance. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head responded to Puali‘i: “Hello, friend, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o then struck Puali‘i’s head and pushed him into the Waipouli Sea, a channel at the edge of Honouliuli, the boundary, five miles long.","**Paragraph 9 Analysis:**

• The passage depicts a scene of confrontational action between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and Puali‘i, rich in symbolic and cultural significance. The narrative unfolds during the completion of a pule (prayer), perhaps alluding to a spiritual or ritual culmination reflective of traditional Hawaiian cosmology and customary practices.

• The action of Puali‘i 'o‘oki (cutting or slicing) the 'o‘oki (likely the bundle or head of Nāmakaokapāo‘o), and turning the 'o‘i (the tip or knob), symbolizes a challenge or a ritualized act. This measure could represent a test of strength, power, or spiritual authority, reminiscent of competitive or ritual gestures found in Hawaiian capstone rites or mele.

• The mention of the head ('po'o) being knocked or struck (kiola) into Waipouli and into the kai (sea) at Honouliuli signifies a symbolic 'casting out' or spiritual dispersal, possibly echoing mythological themes of separation, boundary-crossing, or purification. In traditional Hawaiian thought, the kai often represents both spiritual and physical boundaries—an edge between worlds—implying this act holds sacred or transformative meaning.

• The response of the head ('po'o), addressing Puali‘i with “Aloha ‘oe,” suggests an acknowledgment or acknowledgment of kinship, respect, or spiritual communication, implying a connection beyond physical confrontation. It is notable that the head ""responds,"" personifying an ancestral or spiritual presence, highlighting the vā (space or relationship) embedded within Hawaiian worldview.

• The scene’s climax—the striking of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head into the Waipouli Sea—serves as a symbolic moment of boundary assertion, perhaps indicating a contest of mana or a ritualistic assertiveness. The choice of Waipouli, a channel associated with water and movement, emphasizes transition and liminality, key themes in Hawaiian cosmology.

**Cultural and Mythological Context:**

– The scene may echo mythic motifs where *kane* (the god of creation) or ancestral spirits are engaged in acts of testing and boundary negotiation, often represented in mele, moʻolelo, or ritual acts. The act of knocking or striking the head and sending it into the kai could symbolize the assertion of spiritual authority or a rite of passage.

– The mention of a five-mile length may symbolize an extended journey or boundary—perhaps a metaphor for spiritual or genealogical distance, or an act of ritual significance. Physical measurements in Hawaiian storytelling often serve as allegories for ancestral or cosmic scales.

– The interaction also resonates with historical practices in the 'Ai Kapu era, where ceremonial acts involved symbolism of boundaries, hierarchy, and mana. The aggressive act, infused with aloha, may be interpreted as a form of respectful challenge or reconciliation, embodying the complex duality of conflict and connection endemic to Hawaiian spiritual life.

• Overall, this passage reflects the deep integration of ritual, respect, and boundary-maintaining actions that characterize Hawaiian cultural practices. It underscores a worldview where physical acts are intertwined with spiritual meanings, with speech—such as “Aloha ‘oe”—affirming ongoing relationships, even amid conflict, in the sacred landscape of Honouliuli and Waipouli.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

At that time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief from O‘ahu, residing in Waikīkī where he lived. A man from Honouliuli arrived and went to Waikīkī, where the chief was. He said: “O, chief! Such a small, very strong boy has died, his father has been killed and his head taken by the sea, a very distant place, five miles away. When ‘Ama‘u heard that Nāmakaokapāo'o was alive and that I had killed him, he said: ‘I will die for him because of his strength,’ but I will not die because I am strong himself. While speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o then heard these words spoken about him.","• Paragraph 10 situates us in a moment of emotional intensity surrounding Nāmakaokapāo'o's death, with personal and political implications: 1) Puali'i, identified as a person who returned, indicates a cycle of arrival and departure—perhaps symbolizing the close of a confrontation or the transition of power. 2) Nāmakaokapāo'o's mother, Pōka'ī, and her silent posture (not eating) emphasize grief and mourning, which are culturally significant expressions of respect and sorrow in Hawaiian society.  
• ‘Ama‘u’s role as an O‘ahu chief living in Waikīkī suggests a prominent figure, possibly embodying the territorial authority or chieftainship associated with the area during the pre-Hawaiian kingdom era. Waikīkī, as a significant cultural and political hub, links to historical centers of power.  
• The arrival of the man from Honouliuli hyper-locates the scene, highlighting the interconnectedness of different districts and chiefs within O‘ahu, as well as the importance of communication among ali‘i (chiefs).  
• The statement about the boy, described as a ""small, very strong"" child who died and was mourned from afar, reflects a common motif in Hawaiian hero stories: the recognition of extraordinary strength at a young age. The phrase “his father has been killed and his head taken by the sea, a very distant place,” alludes to both actual loss and symbolic separation—possibly representing death or exile.  
• The phrase “five miles away” (lō'ihi) indicates the distance, literal or metaphorical, emphasizing the vast ocean and land divisions important in Hawaiian cosmology and social structure.  
• ‘Ama‘u’s declaration of willingness to die for the boy because of his strength echoes the Hawaiian cultural value that physical prowess and mana (spiritual power) confer honor and loyalty, even in death. Conversely, his statement about not dying because of his own strength may reflect a recognition of individual humility or a philosophical acknowledgment of life's impermanence.  
• The act of overhearing these words about him (""Nāmakaokapāo'o then heard these words spoken about him"") sets the tone for a pivotal moment of recognition, foreshadowing potential reconciliation or heroism. It also emphasizes the importance of spoken words, oral tradition, and reputation—cornerstones of Hawaiian cultural identity and political life during ancient times.  
• The narrative also subtly illustrates the significance of kinship and reputation, showing how stories and words travel across districts and relate to rulership, respect, and heroism—central themes during the 'Ai Kapu era, where mana was intricately associated with lineage, deeds, and sacred customs.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",

• The act of ""hūnā ma ke ana"" (hidden in the cavity) is significant in Hawaiian culture, symbolizing concealment, protection, or strategic retreat, often linked to spiritual or social concealment during times of turmoil or ritual.
• Waipouli (literally, ""water fairy"" or ""water spirit"") likely references a specific locale or a symbolic space representing sacredness, concealment, or spiritual significance, echoing Hawaiian landscape and mythic geography.
• The phrase ""nalo ka makuahine"" (the mother was lost or hidden) can be interpreted both literally and metaphorically: literally, the mother is concealed within the natural or spiritual landscape; metaphorically, it symbolizes her withdrawal from danger or her transition into a protected state.
• Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions—carrying his mother away, returning to their home in Keahumoa (the ""long plain"" or perhaps a metaphor for a safe refuge)—stresses themes of familial loyalty and strategic movement, critical in traditional Hawaiian storytelling.
• The imagery of climbing onto the ""kaupoku o ka hale"" (floor of the house) and exposing the ""mau'u"" (mat) covering the back and face indicates a ritual or symbolic act, possibly related to spiritual protection, privacy, or a customary practice of resting in a manner that preserves spiritual or cultural privacy, especially during times of crisis or spiritual significance.
• The act of lying ""ma luna pono o ke kaupoku"" (firmly in the middle on the floor) may symbolize a state of temporary safety, spiritual grounding, and readiness, echoing the importance of the physical and spiritual space within the Hawaiian hale (house) as a sanctuary in storytelling and oral tradition. 
• Contextually, this scene depicts a moment of familial cohesion amidst potential peril, illustrating Hawaiian values of caring for family, respecting sacred spaces, and the metaphorical importance of land and home as places of refuge and spiritual strength.","Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there.

They prepared to leave, when Nāmakaokapāo'o called from the head of the group. Hearing a voice, but not seeing anyone's body, they asked: ""Where are you, who is calling out?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied: ""Here I am, up here."" Suddenly, eight men climbed up—four on each side of the house, with Nāmakaokapāo'o found in the middle. They asked: ""What are you calling us for?""

• The arrival of four men (po'e kaua) with about thirty-eight additional men, totaling forty-four, signals a notable gathering—numbers significant in Hawaiian cultural contexts, often representing collective strength or the importance of unity in warfare.
• The scene opens with a dispatch from 'Ama'u, a chiefly figure from Waikīkī, indicating a connection to high-ranking lineages and possibly a mission or military mobilization—common themes in Hawaiian history of chiefly warfare and alliances.
• ""Keahumoa"" is a significant place name, likely a strategic or sacred site in the narrative, perhaps associated with a legendary event or battle.
• The act of entering the house with no one present may symbolize an initial phase of reconnaissance or supernatural intervention, a common motif in Hawaiian legends involving spirits or ancestral spirits.  
• Nāmakaokapāo'o's call from the 'luna' (upper) position, without revealing his body, hints at his spiritual or supernatural presence, aligning with the Hawaiian tradition of *kāne or akua* acting from unseen or elevated realms.
• The question of ""Where are you?"" and the response highlight the supernatural or spiritual nature of Nāmakaokapāo'o—he might be a guardian, spirit, or deity—playing a role akin to a protector or challenger.
• The eight warriors ascending to confront Nāmakaokapāo'o underscore themes of bravery and challenge, echoing the Hawaiian martial ethos of *kāne*, often symbolizing valor and prowess.
• The reference to Puali'i, whose name breaks down into Puali—*loose, weak* or *free*, and 'ī—*to go, to self*, possibly indicating a lineage or symbolic figure—further emphasizing themes of kinship, rivalry, or rebellion.
• The confrontation amplifies themes of youth, valor, and familial conflict through the mention of Puali'i as the slain father of the protagonist, Nāmakaokapāo'o, aligning with recurrent motifs in Hawaiian legends where personal and familial loyalty intertwine with heroic quests.
• Overall, the passage reflects a layered narrative involving ancestral spirits, heroic challenge, and the importance of lineage and kinship—core elements in Hawaiian oral tradition and storytelling.","Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men.

Eighteen is a culturally significant number in Hawaiian warfare, representing readiness and formidable force; the setting at Ewa situates the scene geographically on O'ahu's western coast, a known strategic area. • The detailed journey from Ewa underscores the customary practice of warfare expeditions launched across island regions, reflecting inter-polity conflicts and alliances. • Nāmakaokapāo'o's destructive act, ""luku ā pau loa,"" indicates a fierce, perhaps divine or supernatural, obliteration that leaves no survivors, emphasizing her or its unstoppable power. Nāmakaokapāo'o, often associated with water—particularly the deity of the sea or a goddess of destruction—symbolizes natural or divine forces capable of overwhelming human efforts. • Ama'u's death signifies the loss of a formidable leader or hero, whose defeat aligns with traditional narratives of heroism and the consequences of warfare. • The phrase ""puni a'ela 'o O'ahu nei iā Nāmakaokapāo'o"" indicates O'ahu's domination or being filled with Nāmakaokapāo'o, which poetically suggests her influence or control over the land, possibly reflecting natural calamities or divine retribution. • The return of Ama'u's spirit ('i ki'i akula ia i kona makuahine) and her subsequent settling on O'ahu echo the ancestral and spiritual processes integral to Hawaiian worldview—where spirits of heroes and chiefs influence land and people beyond physical death, reinforcing the cyclical and spiritual nature of Hawaiian cosmology. • This narrative may allegorically depict the ongoing struggles between mortal warriors and divine or elemental forces, embodying themes of destruction, resilience, and ancestral presence. • The story aligns with traditional Hawaiian themes of heroism, divine intervention, and the spiritual significance of land, highlighting how mythic battles serve as metaphors for natural forces and societal values regarding bravery, authority, and the sacredness of land.","When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o.
