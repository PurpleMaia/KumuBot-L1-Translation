His father was Kauluakaha‘i, from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinu‘u. His mother was Pōka‘ī. His father was a high-ranking chief from Kahikipapaialewa, and some of his aspects were divine.","The given passage introduces Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a figure notable for his extraordinary strength despite his small stature, as well as his lineage. This introduction is rich in cultural, historical, and linguistic elements that provide insights into ancient Hawaiian society.

Culturally, the passage highlights the importance of genealogy (‘ohana) and the concept of divine ancestry, which was crucial in establishing the status and legitimacy of chiefs (ali‘i) in Hawaiian society. The mention of Nāmakaokapāo‘o's parents, Kauluakaha‘i and Pōka‘ī, and the specification of their origins, underscores the significance of tracing one's lineage to assert claims of leadership and spiritual power.

Linguistically, the passage demonstrates several notable features of the Hawaiian language. The use of repetitive phrases and synonyms, such as ""he keiki ‘u‘uku loa"" (a very small child) and ""ke koa loa"" (great strength), emphasizes Nāmakaokapāo‘o's unique characteristics. The possessive pronouns and suffixes (e.g., ""kona makua kāne"" for ""his father"") show the complex system of possessor indexing in Hawaiian, which distinguishes between types of possession. The structure also illustrates the typical Hawaiian sentence pattern, where the topic is introduced at the beginning, followed by descriptive phrases that provide more information about the topic.

Historically, the reference to specific locations such as Kahikipapaialewa and Kahikinu‘u, and the islands of Hawai‘i and Ni‘ihau, places this narrative within the geographical context of the Hawaiian archipelago. It suggests that the story of Nāmakaokapāo‘o is rooted in the traditional knowledge and oral histories of the Hawaiian people, possibly dating back to a time before European contact. The narrative's focus on chiefs and divine ancestry also points to a pre-contact societal structure, where chiefs held both secular and sacred powers.

Furthermore, the mention of divine aspects ('ao‘ao akua) associated with Nāmakaokapāo‘o's lineage touches on the religious beliefs of ancient Hawaiians, who believed in a complex pantheon of gods and the concept of mana (spiritual power) that could reside in people, places, and objects. This belief system played a central role in governing Hawaiian society, influencing everything from daily life to political leadership.

In conclusion, the passage provides a window into the rich cultural heritage, linguistic nuances, and historical context of ancient Hawaiian narratives. It underscores the importance of understanding these stories within their original context to appreciate the depth and complexity of Hawaiian history and culture.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97).

Then Pōka‘ī carried Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, and Pōka‘ī stayed with his child, and later, gave birth again. In this birth, Pōka‘ī and his child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were extremely filled with spiritual power.","The provided Hawaiian passage is rich in cultural, linguistic, and historical significance. To comprehend its depth, it's essential to break down its various components. 

Firstly, the passage mentions several names and places that are integral to Hawaiian mythology and history. 'Ewa is a district on the island of Oahu, known for its historical and cultural importance. Hō‘ae‘ae, Pōka‘ī, Kauluakaha‘i, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o are figures within Hawaiian mythology, with roles that vary across different stories and contexts. Understanding their significance requires knowledge of the broader mythological narrative in which they are embedded.

Linguistically, the passage showcases the complexity and expressiveness of the Hawaiian language. The use of words like ""launa kino ai"" (had secretly given birth) and ""hānau 'ana"" (gave birth) highlights the language's capacity to convey nuanced actions and states with precision. The term ""'ilihune loa"" (extremely filled with spiritual power) is particularly noteworthy, as it touches on the concept of spiritual power or mana, which is central to Hawaiian worldview and cosmology.

The historical significance of this passage can be understood by considering the period in which it was written and the purpose it was meant to serve. Many Hawaiian texts, including myths and legends, were recorded in the 19th and early 20th centuries by native Hawaiians and European scholars. These recordings not only preserved the language and stories but also provided insights into Hawaiian culture, social structures, and religious beliefs before the significant changes brought about by European contact.

In terms of cultural context, the passage reflects several key aspects of Hawaiian society, including the importance of genealogy (through the mention of specific ancestors and descendants), the role of spiritual power (mana) in the lives of individuals, and the significance of land ('āina) as a basis for identity and community. The actions of the characters, such as the secretive birth and the eventual acknowledgement of the child, also hint at social dynamics and possibly the political structures of the time.

Furthermore, the story seems to intertwine elements of myth and history, a common feature in many indigenous cultures where the boundaries between these genres are not as rigidly defined as in Western traditions. This blending allows for a rich tapestry of cultural values, historical events, and supernatural elements that together form a comprehensive worldview.

In conclusion, the passage is more than a simple narrative; it is a window into the complex and vibrant culture of Hawaii, replete with historical, linguistic, and cultural insights that require careful consideration to fully appreciate. Its translation and analysis demand a multidisciplinary approach, combining linguistic expertise with historical and cultural knowledge to unravel its multifaceted meanings.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and was attracted to him, saying: ""I desire you as my woman."" Pōka‘ī replied: ""Why do you desire me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is worn out."" Puali‘i said: ""Those things are nothing, if you desire me, we can sleep together."" Pōka‘ī agreed. And then Pōka‘ī, his husband, and Puali‘i went to the plains of Keahumoa and lived.","This passage offers a glimpse into the social dynamics and cultural norms of 19th-century Hawaii, providing insights into the lives of Native Hawaiians during this period. The narrative revolves around the character Puali‘i, a man from Līhu‘e, who expresses his desire for Pōka‘ī, indicating a same-sex relationship, which is a significant aspect of Hawaiian cultural history.

Linguistically, the passage showcases the richness and complexity of the Hawaiian language. The use of pronouns and possessive markers (e.g., ""kāna kāne"" meaning ""his husband"") highlights the language's ability to convey nuanced relationships and social contexts. The narrative also employs a range of grammatical structures, including verb phrases (e.g., ""iā lāua e noho ana"") and sentence-linking particles (e.g., ""a""), demonstrating the language's flexibility and expressiveness.

The mention of specific locations, such as Līhu‘e, Honouliuli, and Keahumoa, situates the story within the geographical and cultural landscape of Hawaii. These places are significant not only for their historical importance but also for their role in shaping the identity and experiences of the characters.

The passage also touches on themes of desire, intimacy, and relationships, which are central to human experience. Puali‘i's declaration of desire and Pōka‘ī's response highlight the complexities of human connection and the ways in which individuals navigate their emotions and relationships.

Historically, this passage is significant because it provides a rare glimpse into the lives of Native Hawaiians during a period of significant social and cultural change. The early 19th century was a time of intense cultural, economic, and political transformation in Hawaii, marked by the influence of Western colonizers, the introduction of new technologies and ideas, and the erosion of traditional Hawaiian practices and beliefs.

The portrayal of same-sex relationships in this passage is also noteworthy, as it challenges dominant Western narratives about the history of sexuality and relationships. In Hawaiian culture, same-sex relationships were not uncommon, and the concept of ""mahū"" (a third-gender category) acknowledges the diversity of human experience and the complexity of gender and sexuality.

Overall, this passage offers a unique window into the cultural, historical, and linguistic context of 19th-century Hawaii, highlighting the importance of considering the diversity of human experiences and relationships in our understanding of the past.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

And when the sweet potatoes were ripe, Puali‘i would say in his habitual speech, “When the head of the ulua fish is cooked with the sweet potatoes, then Puali‘i eats, and his wife, Pōka‘ī, and their children, too, can eat without restriction.” Therefore, Puali‘i would go down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with the sweet potatoes.","This passage offers a glimpse into the daily life of Puali‘i, a prominent figure in ancient Hawaiian society, highlighting his connection to the land, his role as a provider, and the cultural significance of food in Hawaiian culture. The text is rich in linguistic features and historical allusions that provide insight into the social and cultural context of the time.

From a linguistic perspective, the passage showcases the complexity and nuances of the Hawaiian language. The use of words like ""māla"" (patch or garden) and ""‘uala"" (sweet potato) demonstrates the importance of agriculture in Hawaiian society. The phrase ""‘elua āna mau māla ‘uala lō‘ihi"" (having two large sweet potato patches) illustrates the use of descriptive language to convey the abundance and size of the patches. The name ""Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" is also noteworthy, as it suggests a deep connection to the land and the passing down of names and places from one generation to the next.

The cultural context of the passage is equally significant. The mention of sweet potatoes as a staple food source highlights the importance of agriculture in Hawaiian society. The fact that Puali‘i has two large patches of sweet potatoes suggests his status as a provider and a leader in his community. The reference to the ulua fish, a species highly valued in Hawaiian culture, adds another layer of cultural significance to the passage. The combination of fish and sweet potatoes as a meal also underscores the importance of balancing protein sources with staple crops in the traditional Hawaiian diet.

The historical significance of this passage lies in its portrayal of daily life in ancient Hawaii. The text suggests a sense of self-sufficiency and community, with Puali‘i providing for his family and possibly his broader community through his farming and fishing activities. The mention of specific locations, such as Honouliuli, also provides valuable information about the geography and place names of ancient Hawaii.

Furthermore, the passage offers insight into the social dynamics of ancient Hawaiian society. The fact that Puali‘i's wife, Pōka‘ī, and their children are mentioned as beneficiaries of his labor highlights the importance of family and community in Hawaiian culture. The phrase ""no laila, iho akula ‘o Puali‘i i kai o Honouliuli"" (therefore, Puali‘i would go down to the sea at Honouliuli) suggests a sense of routine and responsibility, with Puali‘i undertaking his fishing trips to provide for his family.

In conclusion, this passage provides a unique window into the cultural, linguistic, and historical context of ancient Hawaii. Through its description of daily life, agricultural practices, and social dynamics, the text offers a rich and nuanced portrayal of Hawaiian society, highlighting the importance of family, community, and cultural traditions.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo‘o's body at that time was very weak, with two swellings and a protruding navel, and her illness was not improving, she was very frail. When they arrived at the sweet potato field, Nāmakaokapāo‘o instructed the children, ""Remove all the vines and leaves from the sweet potatoes, don't leave any that are still growing."" However, the children were lazy, so they just pulled gently on the sweet potatoes, without removing the vines.","This passage offers a glimpse into the daily life and struggles of ancient Hawaiian individuals, particularly Nāmakaokapāo‘o, who is depicted as frail and ill. The mention of sweet potato fields, or ""māla ‘uala,"" highlights the importance of sweet potatoes as a staple crop in Hawaiian agriculture. The instruction to remove all vines and leaves from the sweet potatoes suggests a common farming practice aimed at promoting healthy plant growth and maximizing yields.

The characterization of Nāmakaokapāo‘o's physical condition, including her weak body, swellings, and protruding navel, may indicate a state of poor health or malnutrition, which could have been prevalent in ancient Hawaiian society due to limited access to healthcare and variable food availability. The fact that she is still involved in daily activities, such as overseeing the children's work in the fields, demonstrates her resilience and the importance of community and family in Hawaiian culture.

Linguistically, this passage features several notable aspects of the Hawaiian language. The use of the phrase ""i ia wā"" (at that time) and ""i nā māla ‘uala"" (in the sweet potato fields) illustrates the language's ability to convey specific temporal and spatial relationships. The employment of descriptive words like ""‘u‘uku loa"" (very weak) and ""‘elua kapua‘i"" (two swellings) showcases the language's capacity for vivid and detailed descriptions.

The passage also employs idiomatic expressions, such as ""e lewalewa ana nō"" (she was very frail), which adds to the narrative's emotional depth and cultural nuance. The use of the phrase ""kāohi mālie nō"" (they just pulled gently) to describe the children's actions conveys a sense of laziness and reluctance, highlighting the challenges of farming and the importance of diligence in agricultural work.

Historically, this passage may be significant in understanding the social and economic dynamics of ancient Hawaiian society. The mention of Puali‘i's fishing activities and Nāmakaokapāo‘o's involvement in farming suggests a division of labor and a reliance on both marine and terrestrial resources for sustenance. The narrative may also allude to the importance of ohana (family) and community in Hawaiian culture, as Nāmakaokapāo‘o is shown to be involved in the care and instruction of the children, despite her poor health.

Furthermore, the passage may be seen as a reflection of the cultural values of mahina ‘ai (farming and cultivation) and mālama ‘āina (caring for the land), which were essential to the survival and well-being of ancient Hawaiian communities. The emphasis on proper farming techniques, such as removing vines and leaves from sweet potatoes, highlights the importance of responsible land stewardship and the need for future generations to respect and care for the ‘āina (land).","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then, Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned and built a fire, and while the four corners of the taro were being cooked on the heating stone, she turned them. While she was turning them over the fire, her brother Puali‘i arrived, asked their mother, Pōka‘ī: ""Isn't it?"" Puali‘i said: ""Yes, the head and eyes are the parts that my taro is lacking today, therefore, here is its day to die for me.""","The passage provided offers a glimpse into Hawaiian mythology, specifically focusing on Nāmakaokapāo‘o and her interactions with her family. To understand the cultural context, it is essential to recognize that Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a figure associated with the gods and the creation myths of Hawaii. Her name, which translates to ""the eyes of Kapāo‘o,"" already hints at a deeper, mythological significance, possibly relating to the creation or the essence of the universe.

Linguistically, the passage showcases several features of the Hawaiian language. One notable aspect is the extensive use of possessive pronouns and suffixes, which denote relationships between entities. For example, ""kona makua kāne"" (her father) and ""kona makuahine"" (her mother) illustrate how relationships are central to Hawaiian language and thought. The language also exhibits a complex system of grammatical particles and prefixes that indicate tense, aspect, and mood, such as ""noke aku ana"" (went to gather), which combines a directional prefix ""noke"" with a verb ""aku"" (to go) and the aspect marker ""ana.""

Historically, the narrative likely dates back to a period before European contact, given its mythological content. The story of Nāmakaokapāo‘o and her taro patching and cooking activities may symbolize ancient Hawaiian agricultural practices and the spiritual connection Hawaiians had with the land and their crops. Taro, or 'uala, was a staple crop in Hawaiian agriculture and plays a significant role in Hawaiian culture, not just as a food source but also in spiritual and ceremonial contexts. The process of cultivating, preparing, and consuming taro was imbued with spiritual significance and followed strict protocols, reflecting the Hawaiians' symbiotic relationship with nature.

The interaction between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and her brother Puali‘i, along with their mother Pōka‘ī, offers insights into family dynamics and communication within a traditional Hawaiian setting. The dialogue, particularly Puali‘i's lament about his taro lacking a ""head and eyes"" and concluded that it must die, could be interpreted metaphorically. It might symbolize the challenges faced in agriculture, the cyclical nature of life and death, or even deeper philosophical themes about wholeness and completeness.

In conclusion, this passage not only provides a window into Hawaiian mythology and daily life but also demonstrates the richness and complexity of the Hawaiian language. The narrative weaves together cultural practices, familial relationships, and spiritual beliefs, offering a nuanced view of pre-contact Hawaiian society. Understanding such texts requires a multidisciplinary approach that considers linguistic, historical, and cultural contexts, highlighting the importance of preserving and studying indigenous languages and literatures.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw and ran to gather around, standing in a higher spot to gaze at Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Here is the adhesive in my hand, which will put an end to your haughtiness today, and then, I will cook with taro, and eat first, and then, it will be free.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not heed Puali‘i's words, and Puali‘i spoke again, with anger. Puali‘i was prepared to put the adhesive on Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time when Nāmakaokapāo‘o was chanting her death prayer for Puali‘i. The prayer went like this: 
My love is only for the shadowy valleys, 
A withered thing, a shriveled thing is coming, 
Perhaps eaten, perhaps left behind, 
Perhaps left behind is Nākukui‘aimakaokalani, 
That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,

Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i, 
Go, go, only the embryo, 
A human with a spear, 
A spear with a bell, 
Death to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","This passage offers a glimpse into the rich cultural, historical, and linguistic heritage of Hawaii. The narrative unfolds with Puali‘i confronting Nāmakaokapāo‘o, showcasing the complex dynamics of Hawaiian society, particularly in terms of power, respect, and the role of spiritual practices. 

Linguistically, the passage is replete with examples of Hawaiian language structures and vocabulary. The use of phrases like ""Lālau akula ‘o Puali‘i"" demonstrates the typical Hawaiian sentence structure, where the topic (Puali‘i) is followed by the verb (lālau), indicating an action or state of being. The inclusion of spiritual chants, such as Nāmakaokapāo‘o's death prayer, highlights the significance of oral traditions and ritual language in Hawaiian culture. These chants often employed metaphorical language, such as ""Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o,"" which translates to ""My love is only for the shadowy valleys,"" symbolizing the speaker's longing for a place of peace and tranquility, possibly in the afterlife or a spiritual realm.

Culturally, the passage touches on themes of respect, power, and the consequences of pride or haughtiness (as exemplified by Nāmakaokapāo‘o). The figure of Puali‘i, ready to use the adhesive (ko‘ilipi) as a form of revenge or to assert dominance, underscores the complex societal hierarchies and the importance of maintaining balance and harmony within the community. The mention of cooking taro and eating first also points to the significance of food and communal dining in Hawaiian culture, where sharing meals was not just about sustenance but also about social bonding and status.

Historically, this narrative likely reflects the societal values and challenges of pre-contact Hawaii, where spiritual leaders, ali‘i (chiefs), and the common people navigated a complex web of relationships, obligations, and spiritual beliefs. The reference to Nāmakaokai‘a as the ""great chief of Hawai‘i"" places the story within a specific historical context, possibly alluding to the period before the unification of the islands under a single ruler, highlighting the political and social dynamics of the time.

In conclusion, the passage provides a multifaceted view of Hawaiian culture, language, and history, weaving together themes of spirituality, social hierarchy, and the intricate relationships between individuals and their environment. It serves as a window into a rich and complex society, where spiritual beliefs, communal practices, and individual actions were deeply intertwined.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

The text mentions two significant figures, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, who are identified as great chiefs (ali‘i nui) of Hawai‘i. The relationship between these two individuals is clarified as parent and child, with Nāmakaokalani being the father and Nāmakaokai‘a being the child. 

Linguistically, this passage showcases the complexity and depth of the Hawaiian language. The use of the phrase ""Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki"" as an introductory statement indicates a shift in the narrative, signaling that the speaker is about to delve into a new topic or provide additional information. The employment of possessive pronouns and suffixes, such as ""‘o ia ‘o"" to indicate the subjects and their relationship, demonstrates the language's capacity for nuanced expression of kinship and genealogy.

The mention of these chiefs being included ""in the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" hints at the spiritual and ritual significance of these figures within Hawaiian culture. In Hawaiian tradition, prayers and chants often invoked the names of ancestors and deities to seek blessings, protection, or guidance. The inclusion of Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a in such a prayer suggests their importance as ancestral figures, whose spirits could influence the lives of their descendants and the community.

Historically, understanding the context of this passage requires knowledge of Hawaiian genealogy and the roles that ali‘i (chiefs) played in Hawaiian society. Ali‘i were not only political leaders but also spiritual guides, responsible for maintaining the balance and well-being of their people and the land through their connection with the divine. The fact that Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a are referenced as great chiefs underscores their influence and stature within their community.

Moreover, the passage highlights the importance of genealogy (mo‘okū‘auhau) in Hawaiian culture, where knowing one's ancestors and their stories is crucial for understanding one's identity, role in society, and connection to the land and the gods. The relationship between Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, as well as their inclusion in a prayer, illustrates the intricate web of familial, spiritual, and political relationships that defined Hawaiian society.

In conclusion, this Hawaiian passage offers a window into the complex cultural, linguistic, and historical dynamics of ancient Hawai‘i. It underscores the significance of genealogy, the role of ali‘i, and the spiritual practices that were integral to Hawaiian life, providing valuable insights into the beliefs, values, and traditions of the Hawaiian people.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Puali‘i's head was presented to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, saying: ""Farewell, Nāmakaokapāo‘o."" Nāmakaokapāo‘o then took Puali‘i's head and threw it into the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the coast of Honouliuli, which is five miles long.","This passage is rich in cultural, linguistic, and historical significance. The narrative revolves around the encounter between Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a legendary figure, and Puali‘i, which ultimately leads to the demise of the latter. The use of the word ""pule"" (prayer) in the passage highlights the spiritual and cultural practices of the ancient Hawaiians. The act of prayer is a significant aspect of Hawaiian culture, and its inclusion in this narrative underscores the importance of spiritual rituals in the lives of the indigenous people.

The arrival of Puali‘i and the subsequent violent act of striking Nāmakaokapāo‘o with a ""ko‘ilipi"" (stone adze) is a pivotal moment in the passage. The ""ko‘ilipi"" is an important tool in Hawaiian culture, often used for both practical and ceremonial purposes. Its use as a weapon in this context underscores the intensity and brutality of the encounter between the two characters.

The exchange between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, particularly the phrase ""Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" (Farewell, Nāmakaokapāo‘o), is significant. The word ""aloha"" is often mistranslated as simply ""hello"" or ""goodbye,"" but in this context, it carries a deeper meaning, implying a sense of respect, affection, and possibly even mockery. The use of ""aloha"" in this passage highlights the complexity of the Hawaiian language and the nuances of its vocabulary.

The geographical references in the passage, such as Waipouli and Honouliuli, provide valuable insights into the historical and cultural context of the narrative. These locations are likely significant to the indigenous people of Hawaii, and their inclusion in the story serves to ground the narrative in a specific time and place.

Linguistically, the passage showcases the unique features of the Hawaiian language, including its grammatical structure, vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions. The use of words such as ""lālau"" (to take or carry) and ""kiola"" (to throw) demonstrates the language's distinctiveness and expresses the dynamic and often violent nature of the encounter between the characters.

Historically, this passage may be significant in understanding the cultural and social dynamics of ancient Hawaiian society. The narrative may be seen as a reflection of the conflicts, power struggles, and spiritual practices that were prevalent during that time. The inclusion of legendary figures and supernatural elements also suggests that the passage may be part of a larger cultural or mythological narrative, which could provide valuable insights into the beliefs, values, and traditions of the indigenous people of Hawaii.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
