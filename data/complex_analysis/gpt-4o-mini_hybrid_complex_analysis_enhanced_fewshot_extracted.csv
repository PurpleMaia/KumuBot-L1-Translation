namakaokapaoo_ch1_p1,1,1,"He keiki ‘u‘uku loa ‘o **a)** Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a he  keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio, ‘a‘ohe ona lua  ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau, i ka  ‘u‘uku a me ke koa loa. **b1)** ‘O Kauluakaha‘i, kona   makua kāne, **c)** no Kahikipapaialewa, he ‘āina i  Kahikinu‘u. **b2)** ‘O Pōka‘ī ka makuahine. **c)** He ali‘i  nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa, a **b1)** he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona.","""Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little child, and he was incredibly strong during his youth. There was no one like him in these islands from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau in his small stature and great bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his father, from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he had divine lineage as well.""","**Paragraph 1:** 
• This passage introduces the main character, **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**, establishing foundational aspects of Hawaiian storytelling: **a)** a description of his character traits, **b)** his parentage, and **c)** the origins of his family. This sets the stage for the protagonist's challenges and adventures ahead. 

• **Nāmakaokapāo‘o (m)** (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) embodies both physical prowess and an unexpected juxtaposition of stature and bravery, suggesting a theme often found in Hawaiian narratives where outward appearances may not reflect one’s true strength or capabilities. His title invokes a connection with nature, particularly aquatic life (pāo'o fish), which points to the spiritual significance of fish in Hawaiian culture as symbols of abundance and resourcefulness.

• The father, **Kauluakaha‘i (m)** (a variant of Kauluakahi, where ‘kaha‘i’ may suggest an inspiration or influence), reflects high nobility and potentially divine ancestry. His association with **Kahikipapaialewa** indicates a lineage deeply rooted in the mythos and history of the Hawaiian Islands. This name connotes the idea of a sky or realm from another world, suggesting that the family's narratives may intertwine with the divine or ancestral spirits, characteristic of many high chiefs who were believed to possess mana (spiritual power). 

• The mention of **Kahikinu‘u** (which likely translates to the pinnacle of the land or Heaven) associated with **Kahikipapaialewa** suggests an interplay between different realms—earth and sky—reflecting traditional Hawaiian beliefs in the connectivity of these domains. This also implies that the narrative may delve into themes of aspiration and guidance from the sky, a common motif in Hawaiian storytelling.

• **Pōka‘ī (f)** (perhaps meaning ‘Night falls upon the high chief’), his mother, is briefly mentioned here; however, her unnamed qualities further amplify the idealization of women in Hawaiian culture—holding strength and being pivotal in the lineage. While not explicitly defined in this section, it is likely she embodies nurturing qualities, central to familial bonds.

• The familial structure is further emphasized with the term **ali‘i nui**, meaning high chief, signifying the importance of genealogy and status among Hawaiian families. This insight into **Kauluakaha‘i’s** lineage not only situates Nāmakaokapāo‘o within a noble heritage but highlights the significance of local governance and leadership roles in the community's moral framework, reflecting a period when lineage and kinship defined much of Hawaiian society.

• The phrase **he ‘ao‘ao akua** (a divine lineage) echoes the intertwined nature of politics and spirituality in traditionally governed Hawai‘i. It suggests that this character may possess inherent spiritual attributes that can play a role in forthcoming events in the narrative. This hints at the complex belief system where rulers, by virtue of their divine ancestry, wield both secular and spiritual authority.

• In summary, this introduction sets a rich tapestry of interrelationships, infusing character development with cultural and spiritual significance that resonates through generations in Hawaiian narratives, exemplifying the importance of character heritage—both genetic and spiritual—within the community. It becomes evident that while Nāmakaokapāo‘o may be small, he is destined for greatness through his lineage, strength, and bravery, laying a foundation for greater adventures to come.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This chapter unfolds the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a child described as possessing extraordinary strength and remarkable bravery, positioning him within a lineage of high chiefdom, further enhancing the themes of divinity and nobility that are prevalent in Hawaiian oral traditions. The initial passages establish a foundational understanding of the character's origins, noting his parents—Kauluakaha‘i, a high chief, and Pōka‘ī—who faced poverty upon his birth (Paragraphs 1 and 2). The socio-economic struggles depicted reflect the greater historical narrative of native Hawaiians during times of political upheaval and the transition to a new, colonized identity.

The narrative progresses to portray Pōka‘ī in a relationship with Puali'i, suggesting themes of agency, choice, and resilience, even amidst social stigmas associated with motherhood and physical changes post-birth (Paragraph 3). This coupling evokes the dynamics of power and affection within traditional Hawaiian society, revealing how romantic relationships intersect with societal hierarchies and personal aspirations.

The youthful exploits of Nāmakaokapāo‘o introduce motifs of strength and heroism through his actions in the sweet potato patches, where he displays not only physical prowess but also foreshadows conflicts that will arise within the narrative (Paragraphs 4 and 5). His interactions with peers, especially their trepidation in following his directives, resonate with themes of leadership and assertion of will against societal expectations.

The chapter also critically examines the impending violence as Puali'i turns against Nāmakaokapāo‘o, intending to take his life as part of an allegorical struggle for dominance (Paragraph 6-9). Nāmakaokapāo‘o's prayer, which juxtaposes imagery of death with themes of notable Hawaiian chiefs, serves as a significant cultural reference, indicating the intertwining of mortal struggle with divine lineage. It signals the import of cultural memory with names like Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, embedding the narrative within a larger historical framework of leadership and lineage that would resonate with the readers of the time.

The subsequent conflict that arises invites a deeper analysis of colonial narratives in Hawaiian literature. Nāmakaokapāo‘o engages with warriors sent to challenge him (Paragraph 12), depicting the struggle between indigenous Hawaiian values and the encroaching forces of Western influence, a theme that would have been particularly poignant given the historical context of the late 19th century. The chapter’s emphasis on the physical embodiment of strength and conquest reinforces the notions of identity and agency amidst colonial rejection and warfare.

The culmination of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s violent encounters leads to the systematic extermination of foes and a form of dominance over O‘ahu, effectively suggesting both a reclamation of power and a layered commentary on the loss of agency faced by Hawaiians in the wake of annexation and colonialism (Paragraphs 13-14). The power dynamics reflected in Nāmakaokapāo‘o's actions may symbolize a complex negotiation of identity, resistance, and the struggle against cultural displacement.

The chapter, therefore, serves as a critical text for understanding Hawaiian literature's role as a means of cultural preservation and political resistance. It highlights the ongoing tensions between indigenous identity and external influence, inviting interpretations that consider the contemporary implications of colonial narratives. Synthesizing the themes of duality in strength and vulnerability, agency amidst subjugation, and ultimately a narrative of resilience creates a rich tapestry reflective of Hawaiian cultural history and advocacy for native sovereignty.

In conclusion, this chapter presents a multifaceted allegory intertwined with historical realities of Hawaiians during the period of colonial transition, offering insightful reflections that resonate with the current discourse on identity, power, and cultural heritage in the Hawaiian context."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. A hāpai ‘o Pōka‘ī iā   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i i kona  ‘āina, noho ihola ‘o Pōka‘ī me kona hāpai, a ma hope, hānau. Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o  Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","“Hō‘ae‘ae is the land in ‘Ewa, where they engaged in physical intimacy with the procreation of Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Pōka‘ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, while Pōka‘ī lived with her pregnancy, and afterward, she gave birth. In this birth, Pōka‘ī was extremely impoverished, along with her child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”","**Paragraph 2:** 
• The passage introduces an essential thematic element of Hawaiian stories: the connection between place and relationship. The name **Hō‘ae‘ae** (from the root 'hō‘ae' which means 'fertile' or 'productive') indicates a location abundant with resources, tied to the acts of procreation and intimacy that lead to birthing a significant character, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.
  
– The reference to **‘Ewa** (which translates to 'the set of desired things'); depicts a geographic context that serves as the backdrop for the protagonists' relationship and represents historical land affiliations which were significant in traditional Hawaiian society.  
  
• The phrase **launa kino ai** translates as 'to engage in physical intimacy,' a euphemism that reflects the sacredness of the union in Hawaiian culture, accentuating the importance of procreation and lineage, commonly revered themes in the context of Hawaiian mythology and genealogy.
  
– This could also suggest a broader cultural practice where private matters such as intimacy are openly acknowledged in folklore, reinforcing familial connections and human relationships through storytelling.

• **Hāpai** (to become pregnant) emphasizes the significant roles of women in Hawaiian culture, as the act of bearing children is highly regarded. **Pōka‘ī** (potentially alluding to 'pile or heap from the uniqueness of the night') thus takes center stage. The characterization of Pōka‘ī as **‘ilihune loa** (extremely impoverished) serves to highlight contrasts within the narrative—a common literary device within the tradition to provoke empathy and explore the struggles of characters in their sacred quests.

– Pōka‘ī’s poverty suggests themes of resilience and determination frequently encountered in Hawaiian mythology, where an “ali‘i” (chief) may face trials that test their strength and integrity. The plight of her and her son reveals the complexities of motherhood and the socioeconomic conditions of early Hawaiian society. 

• This birth narrative also places strong emphasis on the lineage of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, marking him not merely as a child but as a progenitor of significant socio-cultural implications. The involving of **Kauluakaha‘i** (the hero or vanquisher of Kaha‘i, echoing traits of a demigod) returning to his own land while Pōka‘ī remains with child encapsulates the dynamics of gender roles of the time where men might venture away for responsibilities while women often maintained family and domestic ties. 

– The return of Kauluakaha‘i to his land might symbolize the cyclical nature of Hawaiian cosmology, intertwining liberation and the obligations tied to one’s location. There is an interconnectedness to migrate, explore, and the responsibilities that arise from familial ties, anchoring the tale within the broader framework of Hawaiian values correlating with land, family, and identity.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p3,1,3,"Iā lāua e noho ana, iho maila ‘o Puali‘i, he  kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e, i ka lawai‘a ma kai o  Honouliuli, kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka‘ī.

A ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘ī me kāna kāne me  Puali‘i ā ke kula o Keahumoa, noho.","While they were living together, Puali'i, a good man from Līhu'e, came down to fish at the shore of Honouliuli and visited the home of Pōka'ī. He looked at Pōka'ī and liked her, saying, ""I would like you to be my woman."" Pōka'ī replied, ""How could you want me? I have given birth to a child and my body is ruined."" Puali'i said, ""Those things are nothing. If you like me, let us be together."" Pōka'ī agreed. Then she returned with her partner Puali'i to the fields of Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 1:** 
• This passage introduces Puali'i, a man characterized as ""a good man"" (kanaka maika'i), suggesting qualities of kindness and morality, attributes highly valued in Hawaiian culture. The location, Līhu'e, situates him historically and geographically, emphasizing his connection to a specific community and identity. 

• The setting of Honouliuli (dark bay) and its significance as a fishing ground illustrates the deep relationship Hawaiians have maintained with the sea as a provider of sustenance. Fishing is not merely an economic activity but a cultural practice connected to heritage and sustenance, particularly among the Hawaiian people who have relied on these resources for generations.

**Paragraph 2:**
• Puali'i's visit to Pōka'ī's home signals a customary social interaction in Native Hawaiian culture, where sharing food and visiting neighbors reflects the values of ‘ohana (family) and mana (spiritual power). This is in line with the etiquette that was common during the 'Ai Kapu era, which stressed community, sharing, and hospitality.

• When Puali'i expresses his desire for Pōka'ī to be his wahine (woman), it underscores the expectations surrounding romantic and social relationships in Hawaiian society, often marked by partnerships that involve more than mere affection but also community recognition and familial ties.

**Paragraph 3:**
• Pōka'ī's response, highlighting her perceived flaws—her motherhood and the change in her body—reveals a culturally contextual perspective of beauty and femininity. In traditional Hawaiian culture, physical attributes and the ability to bear children are significant, yet they also weigh heavily on women's self-esteem—a duality that Pōka'ī grapples with. The phrase “ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino” (my body is ruined) reflects a societal pressure on women to maintain a certain image, which is still relevant today.

• Puali'i’s reassuring response, “He mea ‘ole ia mau mea” (those things are nothing), emphasizes his inclination to look beyond physical appearance and past circumstances. This reinforces themes of compassion and understanding in relationships, connected to the value placed on inner qualities over superficial attributes in Hawaiian cultural discourse.

**Paragraph 4:**
• The agreement between Pōka'ī and Puali'i to be together indicates a resolution of doubts regarding her worthiness as a partner. Her decision to return to the fields of Keahumoa with him signifies an acceptance of familial bonds and cultural practices surrounding marriage, where the relationship involves not just the two individuals but their respective families and communities.

• Keahumoa, meaning ‘the “heap of chickens,” reflects both a physical place and a metaphor for abundance and fertility. This deeply connects the narrative back to themes of sustenance and agrarian life central to Hawaiian culture, underscoring how the land and community are interwoven into personal relationships. Thus, Pōka'ī’s movement toward a life with Puali'i also symbolizes rebirth and new beginnings, milestones in the cycle of life rooted in Hawaiian tradition.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

No laila, iho akula ‘o Puali‘i i kai  o Honouliuli e lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala.","**Paragraph 4:** 
• The scene opens with a description of Nāmakaokapāo'o's connection to the land, indicating his agricultural operations: ""Noho ihola i laila, mahi 'ai"" (He was living there, farming). 
– This indicates a sustained relationship between the protagonist and the sacred practice of cultivation, which is central to Hawaiian life and spirituality. 
– The mention of the ""mau māla 'uala lō'ihi"" (long sweet potato patches) emphasizes agricultural stewardship and abundance, foundational elements of Hawaiian subsistence.

• The sweet potatoes are notably named after Nāmakaokapāo'o, which reflects the traditional Hawaiian practice of assigning significant names to land and crops, often as a means of honoring cultural heritage. 
– The etymology of “Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) suggests a connection to strength, oversight, and the remarkable traits of this mythical creature, indicating that these patches are not merely crops but embedded with identity and legacy.

• Puali'i's declaration: ""Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala"" (There are two heads, one of the ulua and one of the sweet potato) introduces an invitation to ritual and symbolic consumption.
– The ulua (Caranx ignobilis) here represents strength and is intricately tied to the concept of ‘Ai Kapu, a time when food sharing between genders was regulated, highlighting societal norms around gender roles in subsistence and food gathering.

• He states, “a ‘ai ‘o Puali‘i” (and he eats), which can be interpreted as a challenge to the norms by stating that he will partake in what is traditionally reserved for certain circumstances (indicating that he breaks from the norm).
– “Pōka‘ī a me nā mea ‘ē a‘e” suggests that Puali'i’s actions are meant not only for himself but to also provide for his women and others, demonstrating hospitality and generosity; both key Hawaiian values.

• The directive to “iho akula ‘o Puali‘i i kai o Honouliuli” (Puali‘i went down to the coast of Honouliuli) emphasizes both movement and community. 
– The name Honouliuli (dark bay) indicates a specific geographical locale, enhancing the narrative’s ties to real places, thus grounding mythic narratives in physical geography. 
– The act of going to gather ""i‘a ‘ai pū"" (to fish for food with the sweet potatoes) illustrates a blending of agricultural and oceanic resources, reinforcing the interconnectedness of land and sea in Hawaiian cosmology.

• Overall, this segment illustrates the balance between traditional practices of farming and fishing, highlighting Puali'i's embodiment of the resourceful Hawaiian spirit. It frames the characters within a critical cultural space where nourishment, societal roles, and identity intertwine, resonating with historical practices and modern sensibilities around land stewardship and sustainability rooted in Hawaiian ideologies.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

The body of Nāmakaokapāo‘o at that time was quite small, with two skies (clouds) and half of his height not firm, and he was swaying. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, he told the children, “Pull up the mounds and all the sweet potato leaves on top, do not leave any that can still grow.” However, the children were afraid, thus they quietly stood by the sweet potatoes, and did not pluck the mounds.","**Paragraph 5:** 
• The introductory actions set a significant tone for Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a character still in formative years yet taking initiative to lead ten children to Puali‘i’s sweet potato patches, embodying traits of leadership and a degree of authority. His name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, suggests ""The Eyes of the Pāo'o fish,"" perhaps referring to keen insight or awareness of his surroundings, indicative of his leadership role, albeit among younger companions.
  
• The detailed description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o reveals both his physicality and his vulnerability: 
  – ""he kino ‘u‘uku loa"" (a very small body), indicates he is still a child, emphasizing themes of innocence and growth.
  – The phrase ""elua kapua‘i"" (two clouds), metaphorically might refer to his potential or ideas that are not yet fully formed, suggesting his capability is still emerging, hinting at duality in his character which may evolve throughout the narrative.
  – The phrase ""hapa kona ki‘eki‘e"" (half of his height not firm) indicates lack of maturity and instability—both physically and perhaps emotionally—hinting at a transitional phase in childhood. ""E lewalewa ana nō"" (was swaying) symbolizes unsteadiness, emblematic of the childish recklessness or naïveté which is often present in youth coming into their own.

• The interaction with the children is telling:
  – ""E huhuki i ka pu‘e"" (pull up the mounds), is not merely an instruction but tied strongly to agricultural practices, specifically the harvesting traditions associated with the sweet potato (uala), a staple of Hawaiian sustenance. This relates to the 'Ai Kapu era where land management and cultivation were sacred and tied closely to community survival.
  – The command to not leave any ""that can still grow"" speaks to a sense of urgency or perhaps desperation, indicating a lack of understanding of sustainable practices among his young companions. This contrasts with traditional wisdom, showcasing the potential conflicts between youthful impulse and the wisdom often borne from experience.
  
• The children's fear:
  – The phrase ""makau nō ua keiki"" (the children were afraid) introduces a critical perspective of the young characters, highlighting their hesitation to engage in what is a typically necessary agricultural practice, thus perhaps foreshadowing future events of resistance to leadership or established norms. Their reluctance to act showcases youthful inexperience and their vulnerability in the face of potential consequences of their actions.
  – ""kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala"" (thus they quietly stood by the sweet potatoes), presents a poignant image of passivity amidst uncertainty. This passivity contrasts sharply with Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s initiative, hinting at potential themes of leadership, accountability, and the burden of expectation versus the fear of consequence within community dynamics.

This passage effectively serves as an allegory for growth, responsibility, and the interplay between youthful bravado and the collective wisdom of the community, highlighting critical tensions in the pursuit of tradition versus genuine learning.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Thus he tore apart both patches until there arose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty mounds in all from the two patches. Then, Nāmakaokapāo'o went back and lit a fire to broil four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather came back and reached him and asked Nāmakaokapāo's mother, Pōka'ī, and she said, ""No."" Puali'i said, ""Yes, his head and eyes as food to go with the sweet potatoes that I'll eat today. So, today I will kill him.""","**Paragraph 6:**  
• The passage reveals significant themes in Hawaiian culture, particularly regarding the relationship between land, sustenance, and familial authority.  
– Nāmakaokapāo'o, the young protagonist, engages in the act of removing 'uala (sweet potato) from the earth, showcasing the sustenance role of this tuber in traditional Hawaiian agriculture. Sweet potatoes are often considered a staple food, and their cultivation is reflective of the sacred connection between the land (āina) and the people.  
– The act of tearing apart the sweet potato patches can be viewed both as a literal and symbolic expression of wastefulness; it may indicate youthful recklessness or perhaps a challenge to traditional values of stewardship over the land. The number ""forty"" could also signify completeness or fullness in some Hawaiian contexts, amplifying the magnitude of the destruction he initiates.

• The sequence of Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions—tearing out the sweet potatoes, lighting a fire, and preparing to cook the vines—exemplifies the lifecycle of cultivation, harvesting, and consumption, which is central to Hawaiian agricultural practices.  
– The use of a fire pit (kapuahi) for cooking reinforces the importance of fire in traditional Hawaiian culinary practices, often associated with rituals of warmth and transformation. The concept of 'ōhinu (broiling or wilted) refers not only to the physical act of cooking but also hints at the cultural transformation of natural resources into nourishment, embodying the idea that food must be prepared and respected.

• The dialogue exchange between Puali'i and Pōka'ī introduces themes of tension and parental authority. Puali'i’s threat against Nāmakaokapāo'o can be interpreted as a reaction to the boy's actions of destruction.  
– Here, the name Puali'i (an indicator of nobility or high rank: ""puā"" suggests a flower, while ""li'i"" refers to smallness or youth) signifies no mere mortal but rather a figure representing the protective, and sometimes violent, authority of the adult world in relation to youth misconduct.  
– Pōka'ī's response of '“A'ole” (no) displays a mother's instinctive defense of her child; yet Puali'i’s assertive “Ae” (yes) in response indicates a shift in authority where reverence towards Pā'i can mean acceptance or compliance with the ultimatum issued by an elder. This reflects the complex dynamics often present in familial relationships within Hawaiian culture.

• The metaphorical significance in the threats of cannibalism (eating the ‘po'o’ and ‘nā maka’) brings a heavier, allegorical layer to the narrative.  
– Eating the head (po'o) and eyes (nā maka) of Nāmakaokapāo'o could imply a deeper criticism of how energetic, youthful transgressions can threaten the community or familial structure, suggesting the potential for internal dissolution. This reflects broader cultural themes of identity, autonomy, and societal responsibility, particularly in the context of the 'Ai Kapu (sacred eating) era, where consumption held multi-dimensional significance beyond mere sustenance.

• Overall, this narrative illustrates a rich tapestry of cultural practices surrounding land management, culinary traditions, familial authority, and the need for communal harmony in pre-contact Hawaiian society. It is particularly noteworthy how these themes echo the values and beliefs that helped shape Hawaiian identity historically, weaving together the sentiments of connection to 'āina, family, and social dynamics.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw and they ran off, standing in a long line out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, 'Behold! Here is the ko‘ilipi in my hand; it is for cutting off your head today and severing your head, then I will roast it with the sweet potato and eat it first, and then be free.' Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not heed the words of Puali‘i, then Puali‘i spoke again, 'This will be the pit.' Puali‘i was ready to cut Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the ko‘ilipi at the time Nāmakaokapāo‘o was praying for his death concerning Puali‘i. Instead, his prayer went: 'Only the eyes of my pāo‘o friend, I receive, I shall crave for, shall consume, shall be left behind, shall be left behind, the one who is Nākukui‘aimakaokalani, Kukui‘aimakaokalani is that, my love, Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i, let it be, let the spear be but a mere poke, the people indeed with the spear, the spear indeed with the drum, death is certain for Nāmakaokapāo‘o.'""","**Paragraph 7:** 
• In this passage, the narrative escalates with a direct confrontation between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, emphasizing themes of violence and fear within personal relationships. 
– **Puali‘i** (a name that means ""to gather or collect"") embodies the role of the aggressor, while **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish) represents a target of Puali‘i's wrath. The notion of a knife (**ko‘ilipi**) in his hand signals a rite of passage, indicative of a potential act of revenge or resolution of personal conflict.
• The cultural context here highlights the significance of **ko‘ilipi**, traditionally a tool for both practical use and ceremonial functions, including the slaying of a pig for offerings, linking to sacrificial practices in the 'Ai Kapu era.
– The act of preparing sweet potatoes on fire has implications beyond mere sustenance; it also acts as a symbolic preparation for violence—cooking food associated with the land while simultaneously threatening death. Sweet potato growth represents sustenance and prosperity in Hawaiian culture, but the twist of imminent violence underscores the significant tensions between the characters.
• The children witnessing the encounter and fleeing in fear illustrates societal expectations regarding bravery and cowardice, suggesting that fear of violence can override communal bonds—an important lesson in traditional Hawaiian values.
• Puali‘i's words reflect a sense of urgency and determination, highlighting the ‘Ākau (North) direction of action—signifying a goal-oriented mindset often associated with malevolent intentions. The exactness of his threats underscores the single-minded ambition to sever ties with Nāmakaokapāo‘o through both literal and symbolic destruction.
• Additionally, the prayer recited by Nāmakaokapāo‘o before his impending demise reflects deeper cultural beliefs surrounding life, death, and the interconnectedness of relationships. The invocation of names like **Nākukui‘aimakaokalani** and **Kukui‘aimakaokalani** indicates a connection to celestial ancestors or deities, reinforcing their protective and vengeful attributes.
– The phrasing highlights the intertwined relationship dynamics of love, violence, and mortality, which are recurrent themes in traditional Hawaiian lore, suggesting that one’s affection (or adversarial feelings) can possess transformative power.
• Ultimately, the passage conveys the intense themes of rivalry and potential violence against the backdrop of familial expectations and societal hierarchies, reflecting the complexities of interaction and allegiance that characterize Hawaiian folklore.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","“Now I will speak briefly of those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, who were both great chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani was the father of Nāmakaokai‘a, but they were brought into the chant of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”","**Paragraph 8:** 
• This passage introduces two significant characters, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, both identified as ali‘i nui (high chiefs) of Hawai‘i. 
  – **Nāmakaokalani** (the eyes of heaven): suggests a divine or elevated status, with “nāmaka” referring to ""eyes"" or ""sight,"" and “kalani” connoting ""heaven"" or ""sky."" This name implies a chief whose presence is heavenly or authoritative, reinforcing his high status and possibly divine ancestry.
  – **Nāmakaokai‘a** (the eyes of the sea): similarly employs the term “nāmaka,” with “kai‘a” indicating ""the sea."" This suggests a connection to the ocean, which has immense cultural and practical significance in Hawaiian life, including navigation, subsistence, and spirituality. The ocean, as a name element, may symbolize adaptability, depth, and resourcefulness.
• The relationship between Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a is critical: 
  – Nāmakaokalani is described as the father of Nāmakaokai‘a, establishing a lineage that is important in Hawaiian culture, where genealogy often denotes status and identity.
  – The mention of familial ties indicates the strong influence of kinship in Hawaiian society, particularly amongst the ali‘i, where lineage determines power dynamics and social roles.
• The reference to their materials being brought into the pule (chant) of Nāmakaokapāo‘o indicates the importance of storytelling and oral traditions in preserving history and culture: 
  – Chanting (pule) is a sacred practice that honors and remembers ancestors, significant events, and legends. This inclusion signifies that the contributions or stories of these ali‘i were considered essential in the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, suggesting a lineage of power, legacy, and potential conflict or unity. 
• Nāmakaokapāo‘o, likely the central figure in this narrative, appears to be a bridge connecting these two notable ali‘i, thus bringing forth themes of legacy, conflict, and resolution relevant in Hawaiian tradition, where ancestry and stories often intertwine to create a rich tapestry of cultural identity.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

• In this passage, we see Nāmakaokapāo'o in a moment of transition or change. It begins by describing the conclusion of a pule (prayer or chant) after which Puali'i (Child/Descendant of Chiefs) asserts his dominance by ‘o‘oki (to cut), showcasing a common practice in Hawaiian culture where ritual and physical action converge.  
  – The phrase “a pau ka pule ‘ana” indicates that the prayer's ending serves as a significant ceremonial marker, setting the stage for subsequent events.   
• The act of ‘o‘oki by Puali‘i, who is noted to ‘ho‘ohuli’ (turn over) the ko‘i (adze) that had been positioned over Nāmakaokapāo‘o, suggests assertiveness and power. This action could symbolize altering control over the new context in which Nāmakaokapāo'o finds himself, possibly hinting at cultural shifts from traditional values to newer forms of human interactions.  
  – The terminology “ko’i lipi” (a sharp tool) may also imply deeper meanings related to craftsmanship and the importance of skill in Hawaiian society; the sharpness of the ko‘i parallels the clarity or decisiveness in decision-making.  
• “Moku ke po‘o” conveys the notion of Puali'i's head (po‘o) being cut off or demolished, with 'moku' meaning to break or cut; this could imply a significant loss of stature, identity, or power—themes central to many Hawaiian narratives. The introduction of the greeting “Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o” by Puali'i signifies an intimate, albeit complex relationship, where that phrase can denote both affection and a form of finality.  
  – 'Aloha' is a term rich with meanings like love, compassion, peace, and mercy; it is a greeting that signifies connections but can also symbolize parting.  
• In the actions and interactions that follow, we witness the physicality of Nāmakaokapāo'o, who “lālau akula” (seizes) the head of Puali'i and subsequently thrusts it to the waters of Waipouli—a location known for its beauty and cultural significance.  
  – Waipouli (Water of the Little) and Honouliuli (dark bay) are both noted places, suggesting a transition from land to sea, which is significant in Hawaiian cosmology where the ocean embodies the source of life and strength. The distance of “he ana ma kahakai o Honouliuli, ‘o kona loa, ‘elima mile ka loa” (stretching along the shore of Honouliuli, its length being five miles) evokes a sense of vast separation, possibly symbolizing the cultural chasm between the characters and the loss of traditional societal values.  
  – This can be seen as an allegory for the destruction of natural beauty and heritage as represented by the strong, young boy who in his recklessness enacts change that is irreversible; the number five (’elima) traditionally symbolizes the five main islands of Hawai'i and can be connecting to broader themes of connectivity and disruption within and among the islands.  
• Overall, this passage highlights the complexities of relationships and the transformative nature of actions in Hawaiian cultural storytelling, serving as a reminder of the intertwined nature of spirituality, physical space, and personal identity in the narrative. It reflects the tension between traditional values, the consequences of individual actions, and the impact of evolving societal norms during the ‘Ai Kapu era and beyond.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
