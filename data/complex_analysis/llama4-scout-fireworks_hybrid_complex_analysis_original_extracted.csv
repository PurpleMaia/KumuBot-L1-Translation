Understanding the genealogical connections and the lands associated with Nāmakaokapāo‘o and his family provides insights into the socio-political structure of ancient Hawaii. The emphasis on strength and the absence of equals across the islands also reflects the value placed on martial and physical abilities among ali’i.

The mention of specific geographic locations and ancestral ties serves to authenticate Nāmakaokapāo‘o's heritage, illustrating how historical figures were often legitimized through their connections to land, ancestry, and demonstrated prowess. This kind of narrative is crucial for understanding the historical and cultural contexts of Hawaii before European contact.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97).

namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Pōka‘ī impregnated Nāmakaokapāo‘o, then Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, and Pōka‘ī stayed with his pregnant [partner], and after some time, gave birth. At this birth, Pōka‘ī and his child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were very destitute.","This passage is rich in cultural, historical, and linguistic significance, drawing on various elements of traditional Hawaiian narratives and language.

Culturally, the passage revolves around the themes of procreation, parenthood, and social status. The story introduces Pōka‘ī and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, who engage in a romantic and procreative relationship. The fact that Nāmakaokapāo‘o was asleep when Pōka‘ī had physical relations with her might imply a non-consensual or unexpected nature of their encounter. However, given the context, it may be more likely that this detail serves to emphasize Pōka‘ī's agency and perhaps even divine intervention in their union. The narrative further notes that after becoming pregnant, Nāmakaokapāo‘o is abandoned by Pōka‘ī, who returns to his land, leaving her to care for herself. This separation and subsequent hardship may be reflective of traditional Hawaiian societal structures, where family and kinship ties were crucial, but also where mobility and geographic dispersal were common.

The passage also sheds light on traditional Hawaiian family dynamics and childbirth practices. Pōka‘ī's impregnation of Nāmakaokapāo‘o and his subsequent abandonment leave her destitute, suggesting that single parenthood or non-traditional family arrangements were stigmatized or difficult in traditional Hawaiian society.

Linguistically, this passage showcases various grammatical and syntactical features of the Hawaiian language. The use of the possessive pronoun 'o (e.g., 'o Nāmakaokapāo‘o) indicates that Nāmakaokapāo‘o is the one being referred to. Additionally, the use of ka and kona as articles and possessive markers (e.g., ka ‘āina, kona ‘āina) helps to establish relationships between characters and their environments.

Furthermore, historical significance can be inferred from this passage. The mention of specific geographic locations, such as Hō‘ae‘ae and ‘Ewa, suggests that these places held cultural or familial importance in traditional Hawaiian society. Additionally, the narrative may be seen as reflecting or influencing societal attitudes toward family, procreation, and social status in pre-colonial Hawaii.

The utilization of kinship terms and familial relationships also adds another layer of complexity to the narrative. The characters' actions and interactions suggest that traditional Hawaiian societal structures were organized around kinship ties, geographic dispersal, and issues of status and power.

Overall, this passage serves as a rich example of traditional Hawaiian storytelling, reflecting a complex interplay between cultural, historical, and linguistic elements that demand a nuanced and multidisciplinary analysis.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puali'i looked at Pōka'ī and liked her, and said: ""I want you to be my wife."" Pōka'ī replied: ""How can you want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is defiled."" Puali'i said: ""Those things do not matter; if you want me, let us sleep together."" Pōka'ī agreed. Then Pōka'ī, along with her husband and Puali'i, returned to the land of Keahumoa and stayed.","This passage provides valuable insights into the cultural, linguistic, and historical aspects of ancient Hawaiian society. 

### Cultural Context
The narrative revolves around Puali'i, a kanaka (Hawaiian person) from Līhu'e, and Pōka'ī, a woman who has given birth to a child. The passage highlights the significance of physical attraction and marriage in ancient Hawaiian culture. Puali'i's immediate desire for Pōka'ī upon seeing her and his willingness to overlook her past childbirth and what he considers her 'defiled' state demonstrate the importance of relationships and alliances in traditional Hawaiian society.

In ancient Hawaii, marriage was often viewed as a means of forming alliances between families or securing land and resources. The fact that Puali'i is willing to take Pōka'ī, who has a child and considers herself 'defiled,' suggests that social and cultural norms may have varied across different regions or communities.

### Linguistic Features
The passage showcases various linguistic features characteristic of the Hawaiian language. For instance:

- **Iā lāua e noho ana**: This phrase uses the possessive pronoun ""lāua"" (their) and the verb ""noho"" (to stay), illustrating the Hawaiian language's focus on possession and action.
- **Iho maila 'o Puali'i**: The use of ""iho"" (to go) and ""maila"" (directional particle indicating movement towards the speaker) highlights the Hawaiian language's rich system of directional particles, which provide essential context to actions and movements.
- **Makemake akula 'o Puali'i iā Pōka'ī**: This sentence demonstrates the use of ""makemake"" (to want or love) and ""akula"" (a particle indicating completed action), showcasing the language's unique grammatical structures.

### Historical Significance
This passage offers a glimpse into the lives of common people in ancient Hawaii, providing insight into their relationships, cultural values, and daily experiences. The narrative also alludes to the complexities of ancient Hawaiian society, including the significance of land ('āina) and the connections between people.

The mention of specific locations, such as Līhu'e, Honouliuli, and Keahumoa, adds historical significance to the passage, as these places may have held cultural or geographical importance in the context of ancient Hawaiian history.

Overall, this passage provides a unique window into the cultural, linguistic, and historical aspects of ancient Hawaiian society, highlighting the complexities and nuances of traditional Hawaiian relationships, values, and experiences.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

When the ‘uala was ready, Puali‘i said in his promise, “When the head of the ulua fish and the ‘uala are cooked, Puali‘i will eat, and then his wife, Pōka‘ī, and others can eat. Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for food to eat with the ‘uala.","This passage from Chapter 1, Paragraph 4, provides valuable insights into Hawaiian cultural practices, linguistic features, and historical context.

Culturally, the passage highlights the significance of taro ( ‘uala ) cultivation in traditional Hawaiian society. Taro was a staple crop and a vital source of food, and its cultivation was often associated with spiritual and ceremonial practices. The fact that Puali‘i's taro patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, still exist until this day underscores the enduring importance of the land and the cultural heritage.

The passage also showcases the importance of food sharing and reciprocity in Hawaiian culture. Puali‘i's promise to eat with his wife, Pōka‘ī, and others only after he has eaten signifies the cultural value placed on sharing food and ensuring the well-being of family and community members.

Linguistically, the passage features several notable elements. The use of the phrase ""noho ihola"" (stayed there for a long time) illustrates the Hawaiian concept of time and duration, which is often expressed through verb phrases rather than specific time measurements. The term ""māla ‘uala lō‘ihi"" (taro patches of long ‘uala) highlights the importance of taro varieties and their classification.

The passage also employs traditional Hawaiian narrative structures, such as the use of sequential clauses (""a o‘o ka ‘uala..."") to convey a series of events. The incorporation of direct speech (""‘ōlelo ‘o Puali‘i..."") adds to the narrative's authenticity and provides insight into Puali‘i's thoughts and feelings.

Historically, the passage provides a glimpse into the lives of Hawaiians prior to European contact. The mention of specific locations, such as Honouliuli, and the practice of fishing and taro cultivation, suggest a thriving and self-sufficient community. The passage also alludes to the significance of spiritual and ceremonial practices, as evidenced by Puali‘i's promise and the ritualistic connotations of sharing food.

Overall, this passage offers a rich and nuanced exploration of Hawaiian culture, language, and history, highlighting the importance of taro cultivation, food sharing, and community reciprocity in traditional Hawaiian society.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p5,1,5,"A hala ‘o Puali‘i i ka lawai‘a, i ia wā ‘o   Nāmakaokapāo‘o i hele ai me nā keiki he ‘umi  kumamāhiku i nā māla ‘uala a Puali‘i. ‘O ke kino o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ia wā, he kino ‘u‘uku loa, ‘elua  kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e, ‘a‘ole i pa‘a kona  ma‘i, e lewalewa ana nō.

Nāmakaokapāo‘o's body at that time was very small, only two and a half feet tall, his illness not contained, and he was hanging on. When they arrived at that taro patch, he ordered the children, “Dig up all the taro shoots and leaves up high, don't leave any growing.” But the children were afraid, so they stayed quietly among the taro, and did not dig up the shoots.","This passage from Chapter 1, Paragraph 5, provides insights into the cultural, historical, and linguistic aspects of ancient Hawaiian society. 

#### Cultural Context
The passage illustrates a scene of everyday life in traditional Hawaii, specifically focusing on tasks related to food production and family or communal activities. The mention of ""lawaia"" (fishing) and ""māla 'uala"" (taro patch) highlights the importance of subsistence activities in Hawaiian culture. Taro was a staple crop in ancient Hawaii, crucial for survival and deeply embedded in Hawaiian spiritual and cultural practices.

The character of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, described as being very small in stature and ill, yet issuing commands, could imply a person of authority or spiritual significance. In traditional Hawaiian society, people with certain physical conditions or spiritual roles might be viewed with a mix of reverence and fear.

#### Linguistic Features
- **A hala ‘o Puali‘i i ka lawai‘a**: The use of ""hala"" to indicate Puali‘i's action of going fishing introduces a narrative technique common in Hawaiian storytelling, where actions and events are sequenced. ""Hala"" can be translated as ""went"" or ""proceeded to,"" and its usage here sets the scene for the actions that follow.
- **I ia wā ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o i hele ai me nā keiki he ‘umi kumamāhiku**: This sentence demonstrates the Hawaiian way of expressing time and action in narrative. The specification of ""umi kumamāhiku"" (seventeen) children accompanying Nāmakaokapāo‘o emphasizes the involvement of a considerable number of people, possibly implying a significant event or a communal activity.
- **‘O ke kino o Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ia wā, he kino ‘u‘uku loa, ‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e**: The description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o's physical condition is detailed and vivid. The measurement of his height as ""‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e"" (two and a half feet) is culturally specific and historically relevant, providing a tangible image of his stature.
- **Akā, maka‘u nō ua keiki, no laila, kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala, ‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e**: The children's fear and their decision not to dig up the taro shoots reveal a dynamic of obedience and fear in response to Nāmakaokapāo‘o's commands. The use of ""maka‘u"" (fear) and ""kāohi mālie"" (staying quietly) in this context illustrates the emotional and behavioral responses of the characters.

#### Historical Significance
This passage can offer insights into the social and economic structures of pre-contact or early contact Hawaiian society. The emphasis on taro cultivation and fishing as primary activities underscores the self-sufficiency and resourcefulness of Hawaiian communities. Additionally, the portrayal of characters with special conditions or roles hints at the complex social hierarchies and the importance of spiritual or ceremonial leaders.

The detailed descriptions of actions, measurements, and emotional states also reflect a narrative style that values specificity and the sharing of knowledge through storytelling. This style is characteristic of Hawaiian oral traditions, where stories serve as a means of passing down history, cultural values, and practical knowledge.

Overall, this passage is a small but revealing window into the rich cultural landscape of ancient Hawaii, showcasing the language's expressiveness and the society's values and practices.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned and started a fire and roasted four bunches of taro on the burning fire. While he was roasting the taro on the fire, his older brother Kōlea arrived, and asked their mother, Pōka‘ī: “Has he?” Puali‘i said: “Yes, his stubbornness and his eyes are what will cause my taro to perish today, therefore, today is the day he will die.”","The provided passage offers rich insights into Hawaiian culture, language, and historical narratives. Let's break down the elements of this passage.

#### Cultural Context
The narrative revolves around Nāmakaokapāo‘o, who appears to be engaged in agricultural activities involving taro (‘uala), a staple crop in ancient Hawaiian society. Taro was not only a food source but also held spiritual significance. The meticulous description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o going from taro patch to taro patch and then roasting taro suggests a scene of everyday life and the importance of taro cultivation.

The character dynamics, especially the interaction between Nāmakaokapāo‘o, his brother Kōlea, and their mother Pōka‘ī, along with Puali‘i's statement, hint at familial relationships and possibly a conflict or prophecy related to Nāmakaokapāo‘o's actions or nature. This familial interaction underscores the importance of family and community in Hawaiian culture.

#### Linguistic Features
- **Proper Nouns**: Names like Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Kōlea, Pōka‘ī, and Puali‘i are significant as they often carry genealogical and historical information. In Hawaiian culture, names can signify characteristics, origins, or destinies.
- **Directional and Locative Particles**: Words and particles indicating movement and location (e.g., *ā* indicating dispersal or distribution) showcase the language's capability to express spatial relationships and actions precisely.
- **Verbs and Action**: The use of verbs like *huhuki* (to go around), *ho‘i* (to go), and *ōhinu* (to roast) provides a vivid description of actions. 
- **Numeral Incorporation**: The mention of *kanahā* (forty) patches indicates a specific quantity, suggesting that numerical systems were in place for counting and possibly for economic or social transactions.

#### Historical Significance
This passage likely originates from an oral tradition or written accounts of Hawaiian mo‘olelo (stories or histories), which are crucial for understanding Hawaiian history, mythology, and values. The detailed description of taro cultivation and its significance echoes the reliance of ancient Hawaiian society on agriculture and their deep connection with the land.

The mention of specific individuals and their actions hints at the ancestral and genealogical narratives that are central to Hawaiian identity and property rights, especially concerning land and resources.

The prophecy or statement by Puali‘i about Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s fate tied to his ‘stubbornness and eyes’ causing the taro to perish and consequently leading to his death, illustrates themes of destiny, accountability, and the consequences of one’s actions, which are common in Hawaiian literature and philosophy.

In conclusion, this passage serves as a window into the daily life, cultural values, and linguistic richness of ancient Hawaiian society, highlighting the importance of taro cultivation, family dynamics, and the interconnectedness of actions and destiny.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw him and ran to a distance because they were afraid of Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāoʻo: ""Behold! The dagger is in my hand, which will cut off your head today, and your head will be severed, and then we will boil the sweet potatoes, and I will eat first, and then I will set you free."" Nāmakaokapāoʻo did not listen to these words of Puali'i, and then Puali'i spoke again for the second time. Puali'i was prepared to cut off Nāmakaokapāoʻo with the dagger, at that moment Nāmakaokapāoʻo prayed his death prayer for Puali'i. The prayer was like this: 
""Only the eyes of my people have pity,
Oh, press down, trample down,
Whether to eat or leave,
Leave perhaps for Nākukui'aimakaokalani,
Kukui'aimakaokalani is that one,
This is my little brother,
Nāmakaokai'a is the great chief of Hawai'i,
The spear may slip, the spear may turn,
The people are with the spear,
The spear is with the club,
Death to Puali'i.""","##### Cultural Context
The passage provided is rich in cultural context, illustrating a moment of conflict and the invocation of spiritual intervention in traditional Hawaiian society. The story involves characters such as Puali'i and Nāmakaokapāoʻo, who seem to be engaged in a confrontation that may have been common in the periods of ali'i (chiefly) rule in Hawai'i. The mention of a 'dagger' (ko'ilipi) and a 'death prayer' (pule make) highlights the seriousness of the situation and the significance of spiritual beliefs in times of crisis.

The prayer recited by Nāmakaokapāoʻo is particularly noteworthy. It invokes various deities and familial relationships, showcasing the complex spiritual and kinship structures of ancient Hawaiian society. The reference to 'Nāmakaokai'a ke ali'i nui o Hawai'i' suggests that Nāmakaokapāoʻo is claiming a connection to a high chief, possibly indicating his own status or appealing to a higher authority for protection.

##### Linguistic Features
The passage demonstrates several linguistic features characteristic of the Hawaiian language:
- **Use of Directional Particles**: Words like 'akula' (toward the speaker or toward a specific direction) indicate movement and direction, which are crucial for understanding the spatial dynamics of the narrative.
- **Politeness and Formality**: Although the situation is tense, the language used, especially in the prayer, exhibits formal and ritualistic elements, reflecting the importance of maintaining decorum and respect even in dire situations.
- **Repetition for Emphasis**: Puali'i's repetition of his threat and Nāmakaokapāoʻo's structured prayer highlight the use of repetition for emphasis and to convey gravity.

##### Historical Significance
This passage provides insights into the social and spiritual practices of pre-contact or early contact Hawaiian society. The conflict between Puali'i and Nāmakaokapāoʻo, and their respective actions and prayers, reflect the complexities of chiefly rule, personal honor, and the role of spiritual beliefs in everyday life and death. The detailed description of a 'death prayer' is particularly valuable, as it offers a glimpse into the spiritual strategies individuals might employ in life-threatening situations.

The historical significance also lies in the names and potential references to actual historical or mythological figures. Identifying these figures could provide further insights into specific historical events or the legendary history of Hawai'i.

In conclusion, this passage is a valuable window into the cultural, linguistic, and historical contexts of ancient Hawaiian society. It demonstrates the intricate relationships between spiritual beliefs, social hierarchy, and personal interactions within the framework of traditional Hawaiian values and practices.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Here at this place, I will mention briefly those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a. They were two high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the child. However, Nāmakaokai‘a had entered into the care or protection of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

###","This passage from Chapter 1, Paragraph 8, offers a glimpse into the genealogical and socio-political structures of ancient Hawai‘i, reflecting both cultural norms and historical depth.

#### Cultural Context
- **Genealogy and Chiefs**: In ancient Hawaiian society, genealogy was crucial for determining social status and leadership roles. Chiefs (ali‘i) were categorized based on their genealogical purity and proximity to the gods, with higher-ranking chiefs having more divine connections. The mention of Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a as ali‘i nui (high chiefs) indicates their significant status within Hawaiian society.
- **Family Relationships**: The mention of Nāmakaokalani as the makua kāne (father) and Nāmakaokai‘a as the keiki (child) highlights the importance of familial relationships in establishing social hierarchies and alliances. Family ties were often pivotal in securing or challenging leadership positions.
- **Pule (Protection or Spiritual Power)**: The phrase ""ua komo i loko o ka pule"" translates to having entered into the protection or spiritual power of another. In this context, it suggests that Nāmakaokai‘a was under the care, protection, or possibly the spiritual guidance of Nāmakaokapāo‘o. This could be a strategic move for protection, alliance-building, or gaining additional mana (prestige or spiritual power).

#### Linguistic Features
- **Use of ‘Ōlelo**: The term ‘ōlelo (speech, language) in ""e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua"" emphasizes the act of speaking or mentioning, indicating a deliberate choice of words or names to invoke certain meanings or connections.
- **Proper Nouns**: The names mentioned, such as Nāmakaokalani, Nāmakaokai‘a, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, are rich in meaning. For example, ""Nāmaka"" could relate to eyes or looking, ""okalani"" could mean the sky or heavens, and ""okai‘a"" could imply the sea or a chief of the sea. These names reflect the cultural practice of naming that often referenced nature, ancestry, or notable characteristics.
- **Syntax and Politeness**: The use of ""ma ‘ane‘i"" (here) and ""e ‘ōlelo iki"" (to mention briefly) shows a respectful and measured approach to discussing important figures, suggesting a formal or respectful tone.

#### Historical Significance
- **Historical Chiefs**: While the passage itself does not specify a particular historical period, the reference to specific chiefs and their relationships hints at the complex socio-political landscape of pre-contact or early contact Hawai‘i. Understanding these relationships can provide insights into how alliances were formed, how power was distributed, and how Hawaiian society was structured before European influence.
- **Preservation of Genealogy**: The emphasis on genealogical lines indicates the importance of historical record-keeping in Hawaiian culture, not just for family histories but also for land rights, leadership succession, and cultural continuity.

This passage, therefore, serves not only as a brief genealogical note but also as a window into the cultural, social, and historical contexts of ancient Hawai‘i, highlighting the significance of kinship, strategic alliances, and the complex hierarchies of Hawaiian society.

###","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i.

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The head of Puali‘i responded to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Aloha to you, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o grasped the head of Puali‘i and threw it into the ocean at Waipouli, a distance of five miles along the shore of Honouliuli.","This passage from Chapter 1, Paragraph 9, of an unspecified Hawaiian text, presents a rich narrative filled with cultural, historical, and linguistic elements characteristic of ancient Hawaiian storytelling. Here's a breakdown of its components:

#### Cultural Context
- **Violence and Conflict**: The passage describes a violent act between two individuals, Nāmakaokapāo‘o and Puali‘i, involving an adze (a traditional Hawaiian tool). This act signifies conflict, which was a part of Hawaiian society, often tied to power struggles, land disputes, or personal grievances.
- **Spiritual and Supernatural Elements**: The severed head of Puali‘i continues to speak, indicating supernatural elements that are common in Hawaiian mythology. This reflects a belief in the spiritual nature of the soul (or life force) that could exist independently of the body.
- **Expression of Aloha**: Despite the violent context, the use of ""Aloha ‘oe"" (love to you) by Puali‘i's severed head to Nāmakaokapāo‘o shows the significance of maintaining respect and proper etiquette even in extraordinary and adverse circumstances.

#### Linguistic Features
- **Use of Hawaiian Vocabulary**: The passage utilizes specific Hawaiian terms such as ""pule ‘ana"" (chanting), ""ko‘ilipi"" or more commonly ""ko‘i"" (adze), and ""moku ke po‘o"" (his head was severed). These terms are deeply rooted in Hawaiian culture and are essential for understanding the narrative's details.
- **Directional and Locational Terms**: Phrases like ""e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i"" (to turn so that the sharp edge of the adze faces) demonstrate the language's capability to describe actions and positions with precision.
- **Geographical References**: The mention of ""Waipouli,"" ""kahakai o Honouliuli,"" and a specific distance (""‘elima mile"") provides geographical context, suggesting that these events are tied to specific locations on the island, likely O‘ahu given the reference to Honouliuli.

#### Historical Significance
- **Historical or Legendary Narrative**: This passage appears to be part of a historical or legendary narrative, possibly from the early contact or pre-contact period given the absence of introduced European elements. It might reflect actual historical events or be a mythical story meant to convey moral lessons or explain natural phenomena.
- **Cultural Practices and Beliefs**: The text offers insights into traditional Hawaiian beliefs about the soul, conflict resolution (or lack thereof), and the use of everyday tools as weapons. It also highlights the importance of chants and spiritual practices.
- **Language Preservation**: The use of Hawaiian language in this passage aids in the preservation of the language and culture. It demonstrates the richness and expressiveness of the Hawaiian language, which is crucial for understanding Hawaiian history and worldview.

In conclusion, this passage is a fascinating example of Hawaiian literature that intertwines violence, spirituality, and cultural practices. It not only provides insights into historical and mythological narratives but also showcases the linguistic depth and cultural richness of ancient Hawaiian society.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

There is a very strong little child, his father has died and his head was thrown into the sea, it is a very long distance, five miles long. Hearing this, 'Ama'u thought to himself, ""If I were to fight him, I would surely die; but if I do not fight him, then he has great strength."" While he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o heard these words about him.","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant.

The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me.
