namakaokapaoo_ch1_p13,1,13,"'Ī aku 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Ua 'ike au, he kanaka nui nō 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o, a ua hele aku nei ma Ko'olau, a 'o wau he inoa nona."" 'Ī mai lākou: ""'A'ole, 'o 'oe nō, pela ko makou lohe, no laila, e make ana 'oe iā mākou, 'a'ole 'oe e ola."" 'Ī aku 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Ho'i aku ho'i hā kākou i lalo e hakakā ai."" A hiki lākou i lalo, e hao aku ana 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o, pau loa i ka make, a koe aku ho'okahi kanaka, 'o ia ka i holo aku ā loa'a 'o 'Ama'u ma Waikīkī, 'ōlelo akula ia i ka make o lākou a pau loa, a koe ia i 'āha'ilono e lohe ai 'o 'Ama'u.","Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him."" The soldiers said, ""No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive."" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""Well, let's go down and fight."" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
