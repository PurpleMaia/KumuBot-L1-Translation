namakaokapaoo_ch1_p1,1,1,"He keiki ‘u‘uku loa ‘o **a)** Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a he  keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio, ‘a‘ohe ona lua  ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau, i ka  ‘u‘uku a me ke koa loa. **b1)** ‘O Kauluakaha‘i, kona   makua kāne, **c)** no Kahikipapaialewa, he ‘āina i  Kahikinu‘u. **b2)** ‘O Pōka‘ī ka makuahine. **c)** He ali‘i  nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa, a **b1)** he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona.","Nāmakaokapāo'o was a very small child, and an extremely strong one in his youth, without equal throughout these islands from Hawai'i to Ni'ihau, in his small size and great bravery. Kauluakaha'i was his father, from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahiki-nu'u. Pōka'ī was the mother. His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and was also partly divine.","**Paragraph 1:** • This opening paragraph follows classic Hawaiian narrative conventions that date back to the earliest oral traditions and remain consistent throughout all major Hawaiian mo'olelo: **a)** the protagonist and their exceptional physical/spiritual attributes are introduced first; **b)** the genealogy and location of both parents are established; **c)** the specific geographical and political context is situated.

• **a)** Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) - this name carries profound symbolic weight. The pāo'o (common name: manini) is renowned for its exceptional eyesight and its ability to see clearly in turbulent waters. The name functions as an archetype of prophetic vision and future sight, suggesting that this child will ""see"" what others cannot. The repetition of ""loa"" (very) in 'u'uku loa (very small) and ikaika loa (very strong) creates a natural tension that establishes the protagonist's unique nature - small in physical form but enormous in spiritual power. The phrase ""He keiki ikaika loa... 'a'ohe ona lua"" establishes that his strength is not merely physical but encompasses mana (spiritual power) - a child who has ""no second"" or equal across the entire archipelago. This hyperbolic claim serves a dual function: establishing the child's supernatural birthright while setting up the reader/listener for stories that will demonstrate such prowess.

• **b1)** Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i (the inspiration/trace of Kaha'i) - this genealogical name places the child in direct descent from Kaha'i, a major Hawaiian demigod-hero who traveled to Kahiki and brought back both breadfruit (according to some traditions) and the knowledge/skills needed for navigation and agriculture. The name ""Kaha'i"" itself means ""to cause to grow"" or ""to mark out,"" suggesting both agricultural and navigational expertise. Linking this child to Kaha'i through the father's name establishes an aristocratic lineage that transcends mere mortals.

• **c)** Kahiki-papa-ia-lewa (the Kahiki stratum that floats suspended) - this is a mythical realm that appears consistently in Hawaiian cosmology as ""Kahiki-nu'u"" (the elevated Kahiki). Rather than a simple foreign land, it represents a liminal space between the mortal realm and the realm of the gods. The phrase ""he 'āina i Kahiki-nu'u"" indicates that the father's origins are not merely from outside Hawai'i but from a place that exists conceptually between earth and heaven. This serves multiple cultural functions: it maintains the separation between the divine and mortal while establishing the child's mixed nature; it preserves the hierarchical nature of Hawaiian society by associating aristocratic status with foreign divine origins; and it creates narrative possibilities for actions that transcend normal human limitations.

**b2)** Pō-ka-'ī (night falls upon the supreme one) - the mother's name follows typical Hawaiian patterns where the mother's name is simply stated without elaborate description, reflecting 'Ai Kapu era social structures where maternal lineage was subordinate to paternal. The name carries undertones of darkness and concealment, perhaps suggesting that the mother herself possesses hidden powers or secrets.

• **b1)** The phrase ""he 'ao'ao akua kekahi ona"" (some portion of deity he possesses) continues an ancient genealogical convention where aristocratic/historical figures demonstrate their right to power through divine ancestry. This is not merely a claim of personal divinity but a statement of socio-political legitimacy. In Hawaiian thought, this divine portion (mana) is inherited but must be continually demonstrated/proven through action - a child can lose or gain mana through their own deeds. This sets up the narrative tension that will drive subsequent stories: how will Nāmakaokapāo'o manifest the divine portion he has inherited?

• The geographic sweep ""mai Hawai'i ā Ni'ihau"" represents the fullest possible expression of the Hawaiian universe in traditional cartography - the southeastern corner (Hawai'i Island, the first-born island) to the northwestern boundary (Ni'ihau). This serves as shorthand for ""throughout the entire known world"" and places the child's uniqueness in universal rather than local terms.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This first chapter of Nāmakaokapāoʻo's epic introduces a foundational mythological narrative that operates simultaneously as origin story, political allegory, and cultural manifesto, establishing temporal markers that situate the tale's creation squarely within the colonial period while articulating a profound transformation of indigenous Hawaiian social orders.

The text presents three critical geographic anchors—Hō'ae'ae in ʻEwa, Keahumoa in the plains of ʻEwa, and the cave of Waipouli—that serve as more than mere setting; they constitute mnemonic devices linking the narrative to specific O'ahu districts whose names carried significant metaphorical weight in 19th-century Hawaiian consciousness. The ""two long rows"" of sweet potato patches named Nāmakaokapāoʻo, explicitly stated to ""exist to this day"" and ""a name kept until today,"" functions as a textual bridge between mythic past and present, a rhetorical strategy that collapses temporal distance and asserts contemporary relevance. The phrase ""until today"" requires interpretation within the nineteenth-century context of its initial publication, suggesting the narrative was deliberately positioned as still-relevant indigenous knowledge rather than distant legend.

The chapter's temporal positioning is further manifested through its treatment of divine ancestry and mana (spiritual power) in an age when Hawaiian intellectuals were actively reconfiguring indigenous cosmology under Christian hegemonic pressure. Nāmakaokapāoʻo's parentage—his father Kauluakahaʻi, ""partly divine"" and explicitly from ""Kahiki-nuʻu,"" and his mother Pōkaʻi, left abandoned—constitutes a carefully constructed genealogy that mediates between traditional Hawaiian cosmography (Kahiki as ancestral homeland) and emerging colonial realities of paternal abandonment and social dislocation. The father's departure to ""his own land"" resonates within post-Māhele (Great Māhele of 1848) contexts, where alienation from ancestral lands and paternal abandonment became increasingly common historical experiences.

The narrative's treatment of gender and power reveals substantial colonial influence in its portrayal of indigenous social relations. Pōkaʻi's transformation from abandoned mother to ""ruined"" woman whose consent to Pualiʻi's advances is framed through self-deprecation (""my body is ruined""), followed by Pualiʻi's declaration that ""These things are nothing,"" mirrors colonial discourses that positioned Hawaiian women as degraded and available for possession. Pualiʻi's establishment of the ʻai kapu (eating restrictions) concerning Nāmakaokapāoʻo's cultivated patches represents not traditional indigenous practice but rather a caricature of indigenous male possessiveness and arbitrary authority, potentially serving as allegorical criticism of aliʻi (chiefs) who attempted to maintain traditional restrictions amid rapidly changing legal and social orders.

The chapter's central violence—Nāmakaokapāoʻo's destruction of Pualiʻi's crops and subsequent slaying through supernatural power—operates as revolutionary allegory, with the child-hero embodying a new form of indigenous power that supersedes paternal authority through invocation of ""death-dealing prayer"" rather than physical dominance. The prayer fragment ""let the reckless one glide, men indeed with the spear, the spear indeed with the drum"" suggests traditional martial culture being superseded by supernatural agency, possibly reflecting Hawaiian intellectuals' reconceptualization of resistance against Western military superiority through indigenous spiritual practices.

The final sequence—Nāmakaokapāoʻo's single-handed defeat of four military companies and eighteen war-canoes worth of warriors—constitutes a military fantasy that simultaneously evokes ancient Hawaiian warfare while transcending its realistic possibilities. The complete annihilation of Oʻahu's fighting forces and Nāmakaokapāoʻo's subsequent assumption of political control over the entire island reads as compensatory mythology for Hawaiian military defeats across the nineteenth century, culminating in the 1893 overthrow. The invocation of place names like Waikīkī and Koʻolau, still politically charged locations in the 1890s, anchors this military fantasy within the real geography of contemporary Hawaiian politics.

The chapter's significance in Hawaiian literature extends beyond its function as folklore; it represents a paradigmatic example of kānāwai mythologization—narrative transformation of actual political events and social realities into mythic form. Created within the period of American occupation (1893-1898), the story transforms historical experiences of land loss, family dissolution, political overthrow, and military impotence into triumphant indigenous assertion. Nāmakaokapāoʻo's superhuman capabilities function as encoded resistance to colonial power, while his establishment of his mother upon ""the land here on Oʻahu"" offers symbolic restoration of disrupted family and land relationships.

The chapter thus operates as cultural palimpsest, simultaneously invoking authentic Hawaiian genealogical and place-based knowledge while embedding colonial-era political agendas within its mythic structure. Its positioning within contemporary newspaper publication contexts (Ka Nūpepa Kū'oko'a, 1894) places it firmly within the discursive transformations occurring within Hawaiian-language print culture, where traditional genres were being adapted to address immediate political concerns while maintaining indigenous cultural legitimacy through reference to ""knowledge kept until today."""
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o  Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","Hō'ae'ae in 'Ewa was the land, there they met physically and conceived Nāmakaokapāo'o. When Pōka'ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo'o, Kauluakaha'i returned to his own land, leaving Pōka'ī alone with her pregnancy, and later, she gave birth. In this birthing, Pōka'ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo'o were very poor indeed.","**Paragraph 2:** • The narrative has quickly moved from establishing the social identity and lineage of the main protagonist to the circumstances of his conception and birth, which are marked by abandonment and poverty. This represents a classic Hawaiian storytelling device where the greatness of a hero is often emphasized by the adversity of his origins.

• **Place and conception:** – The specific location is given as Hō'ae'ae in 'Ewa. Hō'ae'ae literally means ""to become/appear little"" or ""to shrink"" (Pukui & Elbert: *hō'ae'ae*), which carries symbolic weight when we consider the protagonist's description in Paragraph 1 as an extremely strong but ""little"" (*'u'uku*) boy. This place name foreshadows the physical description of Nāmakaokapāo'o. – The phrase *launa kino ai me ka moe 'ana* (met physically with sleeping) represents a euphemistic way of describing sexual union in Hawaiian narrative, typical of the reserved manner in which such matters were discussed during the 'Ai Kapu era.

• **Parental relationship patterns:** – This passage presents a departure from typical Hawaiian chiefly unions. While Kauluakaha'i is described as a high chief (*ali'i nui*) and demigod in Paragraph 1, here we see a pattern more reminiscent of commoner relationships: conception occurs, but the father leaves. This is significant because in chiefly genealogy, the father's presence and recognition of the child was crucial for legitimacy. – Kauluakaha'i's departure *i kona 'āina* (to his own land) suggests either: 1) a return to Kahikipapaialewa mentioned in Paragraph 1, indicating the union was temporary or politically expedient; or 2) a return to his principal residence within 'Ewa, abandoning Pōka'ī while still being geographically close.

• **Maternal vulnerability:** – The text emphasizes *noho ihola 'o Pōka'ī me kona hāpai* (Pōka'ī remained with her pregnancy [alone]), using the phrase *me kona hāpai* (with her pregnancy) rather than *me kona keiki* (with her child), drawing attention to the burden of pregnancy itself. The word *hāpai* doubles as both physical burden and pregnancy, creating a double meaning of emotional and physical weight. – The final clause *he 'ilihune loa* (very poor indeed) uses the emphatic *loa* (very/extremely) which is somewhat unusual in its intensity. This suggests either absolute deprivation or significant loss of status, as 'ilihune normally describes not just material poverty but lack of social and kinship support. In traditional Hawaiian society, wealth was measured not merely in land or material goods but in reciprocal relationships (*kōkua*) and kinship networks.

• **Theological implication:** – The birth of Nāmakaokapāo'o under these circumstances follows a pattern found in other Hawaiian heroic narratives where divine or semi-divine beings who defy the 'Ai Kapu system are born into situations of social marginality (compare Māui's birth to Hina, abandoned by Hāloa). This suggests that Nāmakaokapāo'o, despite divine paternity, will grow up outside traditional kapu structures, making him free to challenge and eventually transform them.

• **Numerical and calendrical foreshadowing:** – While no explicit numbers are given, Hō'ae'ae in 'Ewa carries calendrical significance in some traditions as marking the beginning of the *Makali'i* (Pleiades) rising period (November), associated with the god Lono and the agricultural cycle. Nāmakaokapāo'o's birth during this agricultural time period foreshadows his relationship with sweet potato cultivation that becomes central to the narrative.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p3,1,3,"Iā lāua e noho ana, iho maila ‘o Puali‘i, he  kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e, i ka lawai‘a ma kai o  Honouliuli, kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka‘ī.

He paid a visit at Pōka'ī's house, looked at Pōka'ī and desired her. He said, ""I want you to be my woman."" Pōka'ī said, ""How could you want me? I have given birth to a child and my body is ruined."" Puali'i said, ""These things are nothing [to me]; if you desire me, let us lie together/sleep as a couple."" Pōka'ī consented. Then Pōka'ī went with her man Puali'i to the plains of Keahumoa [to] live.","**Paragraph 3:** • This passage represents a classic Hawaiian narrative trope of the ""stranger-protagonist"" who arrives and transforms the domestic circumstances of the female character. The story operates within the protocols of Hawaiian hospitality and courtship customs of the 'Ai Kapu period.

**Courtship and Marriage Customs:**
– Puali'i's appearance follows the expected pattern of 'hele hele' (journey/walking), specifically coming ""iho"" (down) from upland Līhu'e (Wāhi'āwā) to the shore (""kai o Honouliuli"") – a classic land-to-sea movement that mirrors many Hawaiian stories of transformative encounters.
– His status as ""he kanaka maika'i"" (a good man) indicates his moral character and suitability as a marriage partner. Unlike later Western concepts, ""maika'i"" in this context includes social standing, demeanor, and knowledge of proper protocol.
– The phrase ""kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka'ī"" reflects the Hawaiian concept of 'hale kipa' (visiting house), where travelers could expect to receive hospitality according to the kapu system.

**Symbolic Elements:**
– The name Pua-li'i carries significant meaning: ""Pua"" (flower/blossom/offspring) + ""li'i"" (small, chiefly, exalted). This suggests either: 1) a person of chiefly descent (even if junior line), or 2) someone cherished like a precious flower.
– The location ""Ke-ahu moa"" (mentioned in the following passage that establishes them there) means ""heap/chicken assembly"" – likely an area known for abundant chickens ('moa'), symbolizing fertility and household prosperity, appropriate for a new marriage site.

**Gender Relations and Body Politics:**
– Pōka'ī's response reveals Hawaiian attitudes toward motherhood and female sexuality. Her phrase ""ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua 'ino'ino ko'u kino"" [I have given birth to a child and my body is bad/ruined] reflects:
  * The physical toll of childbirth in a pre-contact society
  * Possible reference to postpartum restrictions and kapu surrounding childbirth
  * The common Hawaiian practice of identifying significant life changes with ""inoa ho'omana'o"" (commemorative names) – notice she retains Pōka'ī (perhaps ""darkness/night falls upon the chief"") despite her changed circumstances
– Puali'i's reassuring response ""he mea 'ole ia mau mea"" [these are nothing] demonstrates acceptance of maternal transformations – contra to Western taboos, Hawaiian culture often valorized motherhood as enhancing rather than diminishing female attractiveness and social status.

**The 'Moe Kāua' Formula:**
– The phrase ""e moe kāua"" carries nuanced meaning beyond simple ""let's sleep"" – it represents the traditional Hawaiian marriage proposal formula, signaling:
  * Intent for long-term partnership (not casual sexual encounter)
  * Mutual consent (note Pua-li'i's conditional ""ke makemake 'oe ia'u"" [if you desire me])
  * Establishment of a new household unit
  * The beginning of 'noho pu' (cohabitation) which, after four nights, would traditionally establish a common-law marriage

**Spatial Movement and Settlement:**
– Their movement from Honouliuli (coastal area) to Ke-ahu moa (plains/upland) represents:
  * Transition from fishing/horticulture (appropriate for single mother) to taro farming/gathering (appropriate for couple)
  * Typical Hawaiian pattern of village exogamy – Pōka'ī moves to her husband's district (Līhu'e)
  * The creation of a new 'āina hānau (birth land) for their future children, while maintaining Pōka'ī's previous child's connections to Honouliuli

**Narrative Function:**
– This passage serves as economic and social stabilizer for the story: Nāmakaokapāo'o's presence as a fatherless child threatens the narrative, so he gains a stepfather who will provide resources and education
– Puali'i's introduction as ""kanaka maika'i"" and future conflict with Nāmakaokapāo'o mirrors many mo'olelo where stepfathers serve as both educators and antagonists to brilliant but rebellious first-born children","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

When the sweet potatoes matured, Puali‘i made his solemn oath, ""When the head of an ulua is baked together with the sweet potatoes and Puali‘i eats, then the restriction is over and his woman Pōka‘ī and others may eat."" Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the sea of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with the sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**

• The establishing of named māla 'uala (sweet potato patches) marks a significant moment of land tenure and lasting legacy. The phrase ""mau māla 'uala lō'ihi"" (long sweet potato patches) suggests these were permanent, well-maintained gardens, likely aligned with the contour of the land using traditional dryland cultivation techniques. The explicit statement that they ""exist to this day"" signals this as an origin account explaining real landscape features known to the storyteller's audience.

– The naming of the patches ""Nāmakaokapāo'o"" serves multiple functions: it creates a living memorial to the child who bears this name; it permanently links the land to the family genealogy; and it represents the fruits of Pōka'ī's labor as a single mother farming in Līhu'e. The fact that the patches retain this name ""ā hiki i kēia lā"" (until today) suggests these were actual place names known to the community, anchoring the narrative in geographic reality.

• Puali'i's 'ōlelo ho'ohiki (solemn oath) reveals crucial details about 'Ai Kapu ritual practice. His declaration creates a kapu (restriction) centered on the consumption of specific foods - here the combination of ulua head with sweet potatoes constitutes a ceremonial meal. The formula ""aia ā...a laila"" (when...then) follows typical Hawaiian invocation patterns for establishing temporary ritual restrictions.

– The kapu system described here operates on two levels: First, it restricts consumption until Puali'i completes a ritual act (eating the ulua head with sweet potatoes); Second, it includes a deliberate inclusion of ""nā mea 'ē a'e"" (others) in the eventual lifting of restriction, suggesting community participation in ending the kapu. This differs from more exclusive kapu systems that might restrict access entirely.

– The ulua (Caranx species) carries deep symbolic weight in this context. As a large predatory fish, ulua represents masculine strength and chiefly authority. The ""po'o"" (head) specifically denotes the most sacred portion of the catch in 'Ai Kapu practice. Combining ulua head with 'uala creates a synthesis of ocean and land foods, masculine and feminine productive domains, binding Puali'i symbolically to both his male role as provider and to Pōka'ī's domain as farmer.

• The act of descent to kai (seashore) of Honouliuli for fishing represents a recurring motif in Hawaiian narrative where inland people (maka'āinana) journey to the coast to complete the food cycle. Honouliuli's sheltered waters and abundance of reef and lagoon species made it an ideal location for shore fishing, particularly for ulua which congregate near reef edges.

– This movement from mauka (inland) to makai (seaward) creates spatial symmetry with previous movements in the narrative, establishing Līhu'e as an agricultural center connected through Puali'i's marriage and fishing activities to the coastal zone of 'Ewa.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female).

At that time, Nāmakaokapāo'o's body was very small, two and a half feet tall (literally: two feet and a half his height), his foreskin had not yet tightened, still loosely hanging. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, he commanded the children, ""Pull up completely every single mound with sweet potato leaves above, do not leave any growing."" But the children were frightened, therefore they held back gently by the sweet potatoes, not pulling up a single mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• This paragraph presents a carefully orchestrated scene of agricultural sabotage engineered by young Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, employing seventeen companions as accomplices in the destruction of Pua-li'i's sweet potato farms. The number seventeen carries significant weight in Hawaiian numerology - it is one unit beyond the sacred sixteen (kū), suggesting excess or transgression. The seventeen children function as a de facto army under Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's command, highlighting his precocious leadership qualities.

• The physical description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o merits careful attention as it operates on multiple symbolic levels: **a)** His height - two and a half feet - places him far below normal stature for any age, marking him as an exceptional or perhaps non-human being; **b)** The explicit mention of his foreskin not being tightened (ʻʻaʻole i paʻa kona maʻi, e lewalewa ana nō'') operates as a cultural marker indicating extreme youth and social vulnerability. This biological detail serves as legal justification for his actions - as an uncircumcised youth, he exists outside the full boundaries of adult accountability in the 'Ai Kapu system. 

• The command structure demonstrates a child's mimicry of chiefly authority: he ʻkēnā akula'' (dispatched/stationed) the children with specific orders for total eradication (''ā pau loa i luna''). The children are tasked with removing not just the foliage but the entire mound system (''puʻe me ka lauʻuala''). This act represents the complete disruption of agricultural continuity - without mound systems and vine cuttings (maka), the sweet potatoes cannot regenerate, symbolically severing Pua-li'i's ability to provide for future generations.

• The children's refusal (''makaʻu nō'' - they were afraid) provides a crucial counterpoint revealing the sacredness of cultivated land in Hawaiian thought. Their fear likely stemmed from: 1) Recognition of kapu (sacred restriction) regarding agricultural land; 2) Awareness of personal consequences from Pua-li'i; 3) Understanding that such wanton destruction violated fundamental principles of reciprocity with the land. Their ''kāohi mālie'' (gentle restraint) by the sweet potatoes suggests not mere disobedience but active preservation, physically protecting the mounds from destruction.

• This scene allegorizes the tension between inherited chiefly prerogative (Pua-li'i's authority over the land) and emerging individual will (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's destructive autonomy). The sweet potato ('uala), being a relatively new introduction to the Hawaiian islands compared to taro (kalo), may represent foreign or innovated traditions that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o seeks to eradicate. His command seeks absolute annihilation - not just harvest but obliteration of regenerative capacity, prefiguring larger revolutionary cycles in Hawaiian society.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

In this manner he pulled up and ruined both sweet potato patches until the mound of sweet potato leaves rose up, forty mounds being the total from the two patches. Then Nāmakaokapāo'o went back and started a fire, and began to broil four sweet potato vines on the fire pit that was burning. As he was broiling them atop the fire, his stepfather arrived home and reached the place. He questioned Nāmakaokapāo'o's mother, Pōka'ī. She said, ""No."" Puali'i then said, ""Yes, his head and his eyes shall be the relish to eat with my sweet potatoes today. Therefore, this is his day to die by my hand.""","**Paragraph 6:**  
• The child Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) engages in deliberate destruction of the agricultural foundation of subsistence - the 'uala (sweet potato) patches. This act represents more than mere childhood mischief; it is a calculated assault on the productive capacity of the land and the family's food security. The numbers given - two patches yielding forty mounds of plucked leaves - suggest an excessive and unreasonable destruction, perhaps indicating supernatural or precocious strength that transcends normal childhood capabilities.

• The act of hō-'ā ahi (fire-starting) and 'ō-hinu (broiling/wilting) the sweet potato vines carries multilayered symbolism in Hawaiian thought. Sweet potato vines were not typically eaten raw but were the maka (eyes/seedlings) used for replanting, making their destruction a complete severing of future productive capacity. The number four ('ehā) vines specifically selected for broiling may reference the four districts of an ahupua'a or the four primary gods (Kū, Kāne, Lono, Kanaloa), though in this context it seems to intensify the transgression.

• Pua-li'i's arrival as kōlea (stepfather) marks a critical dramatic turning point. The Hawaiian term kōlea (Pacific golden plover) carries metaphorical weight - the bird that arrives from distant lands, establishing this relationship as one of external alliance rather than blood kinship. His questioning of Pō-ka-'ī reveals the dynamics of domestic tension, where the biological mother attempts to shield her child while the stepfather asserts patriarchal authority.

• The proposed consumption of ""ke po'o ona a me nā maka"" (his head and his eyes) as relish ('īna'i) for 'uala represents the ultimate inversion of proper relationship between humans and the agricultural cycle. In traditional Hawaiian thought:
  – The 'uala (sweet potato) was considered the ""body"" of the land, with its maka (eyes) being the propagating elements
  – Human heads (po'o) and eyes (maka) were considered sacred, never to be consumed
  – The ulua fish commonly served as replacement for human sacrifice (as mentioned in footnotes), making Pua-li'i's threat to substitute human flesh for fish flesh a complete reversal of accepted ritual practice

• This passage allegorically represents the conflict between traditionalist adherence to 'Ai Kapu (eating restrictions) and progressive abandonment of old ways. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, as a child of mixed divine ancestry (Kauluakaha'i being part akua), embodies the future that moves beyond restrictive practices. His destruction can be read as a preliminary dismantling of old agricultural-ritual systems that tied human life-force directly to food production and tabu observance. Pua-li'i's response represents the violent retribution of tradition against such revolutionary change.

• The location of this confrontation - amidst destroyed 'uala patches - transforms productive space into battlefield, productive resources into weapons of destruction. The child who destroys forty mounds of life-giving plants becomes the feast for ""his day to die"" (eia kona lā e make ai ia'u), completing a cycle where the land ultimately consumes the transgressor rather than sustaining community life.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

The moment all the other children saw this, they fled and stood at a distance, seized with fear of Puali‘i.

Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o:
“Hey! Here in my hand is a sickle, a thing to sever your head today; when your head is cut off, then it will be baked with the sweet potato and I shall eat before you. Only after that will you be freed.”

Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no heed to these words of Puali‘i, so Puali‘i spoke again—this was the second time. Puali‘i was set to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the sickle.

At that instant Nāmakaokapāo‘o uttered his death-dealing prayer against Puali‘i. Thus he prayed:

Affectionately seen is the eye of my place-of-pāo‘o,
Grow gourd-like, lie scorched on the coals,
To be eaten perhaps, to be left perhaps,
Let Nākukui‘āimakaokalani stay behind—
That is Kukui‘āimakaokalani,
That is my intimate companion.
Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i,
Let him slip away, let the reckless one glide,
Men indeed with the spear,
The spear indeed with the drum.
Then will Puali‘i die at the hand of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","**Paragraph 7:**  
• This climactic moment contains three tightly braided motifs that recur throughout nineteenth-century Hawaiian moʻolelo: **a)** an older male relative raising a *koʻilipi* (cutting implement) against a child perceived as illegitimate or over-powerful; **b)** a *pule make* (death-dealing prayer) that turns aggression back upon the aggressor through the power of the spoken word; and **c)** a clear transfer of the narrative spotlight from an “older” generation still invested in *ʻAi Kapu* principles to a “child” who represents the post-ʻAi-Kapu world.

– Etymology of *koʻilipi*: composed of *koi* “adze” and *lipi* “to cut, slice.” By choosing the *koʻilipi*—the farmer’s sickle for cutting sweet-potato vines—Pualiʻi symbolically attempts to sever the vegetal line that Nāmakaokapāoʻo embodies (the vines are his “eyes,” or *maka*). Ironically, the tool that should nurture the land becomes the weapon that threatens to decapitate the very fertility represented by the child.

• Fear ripple and spatial codes: the phrase *kū maila lākou ma kahi lōʻihi* re-enacts on the physical landscape the social *lōʻihi* (distance) that enforced parental rights (*mākua* prerogatives) under *ʻAi Kapu* sexual codes. The “children” fled because bloodshed (*ʻai koko*) in their midst risked implicating them in violation of *ʻaʻa* (kinsperson) *kapu*. Running to a *kahi lōʻihi* kept the offender’s *hana hihia* (polluting act) within sight yet at a ritually contained distance.

• Exchange of utterances forms a miniature *kāhea* (ritualized call-and-response):

  – First utterance (“‘Ē!”): Pualiʻi announces the stroke itself, guaranteeing in *ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi* that *make* (death) can indeed be proclaimed aloud and therefore enacted. Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s refusal to *hoʻolohe* (listen/obey) breaks the required moment of respect, which in *ʻAi Kapu* logic invites supernatural retaliation.  
  – Second utterance: Pualiʻi renews the threat by starting to swing. The doubling (*ka lua ia*) mirrors the *lua* (second twin birth-order) motif that appears in many stories: the *second* blow never lands, because the child born second—often the “younger” one—possesses a deeper ancestral *mana*.

• The *pule make* itself is structured as a four-couplet chant:

  1.  **Appeal to environment:** *Maka o kuʻu wahi pāoʻo* directly puns on the boy’s name, making the roasted sweet-potato vine (“eye of my planting place/pāoʻo fish mound”) a ritual surrogate for Pualiʻi’s head.  
  2.  **Conditional outcomes:** *E ʻai paha, e waiho paha* mimics the *waiho* tabu word pronounced when a priest decided if the sacrificial victim remained alive or was eaten. Here the target is reversed: Pualiʻi becomes the *ʻai* (food).  
  3.  **Invocation of cosmic/ancestral agent:** *Kukui-ā-imaka-o-ka-lani* (“Torch-of-the-eyes-of-the-heaven”) is probably a poetic designation of the planet Jupiter, said to be the watcher of night travellers. Referencing a celestial torch prepares the listener for the child-firebrand Nāmakaokapāoʻo himself to ignite supernatural conflagration.  
  4.  **Performative closure:** *Heʻe lā… make nō* converts the weapon (ihe, pahu) into metonymic agents of Nāmakaokaiʻa—the high-chief-to-come who abolishes human sacrifice. By rhyming *ka pahu* (drum) with *make* (death) the chant echoes the drumming that accompanied *ʻheʻe* (slipping or gliding away), a proverbial way to describe escaping an older law.

• Cultural resonance: in pre-Christian practice, the *pule make* was traditionally uttered in a temple or at the boundary-stones of a land division (*ahupuaʻa*) facing either the sea or the mountain, “where the voices go.” Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s decision to pronounce the chant where sweet-potatoes are being roasted reclaims the *ʻāina* itself as *heiau*—no longer is human blood required on an altar. Thus the *māla ʻuala* (garden patch) becomes the new *luakini*, and cultivation supplants sacrifice.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

The writer signals awareness that the contemporary listener/reader will recognize these lineage names, thus acknowledging the story's place within documented Hawaiian aristocratic history.

• The two characters named here share the prominent name-element ʻNā-maka-o-, literally ""the eyes of,"" which immediately links them typologically and symbolically with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo himself:
  – Nā-maka-o-kalani (the eyes of the heavens/heaven chief): the father, whose epithet ʻ-kalaniʻ points to celestial/divine status typical of high chiefs whose genealogies claim sky-kāne descent.  
  – Nā-maka-o-kaiʻa (the eyes of the bonito/current): the son, etymologically echoing the sea domain (kai) and the swift, prized ʻʻaʻū (skipjack tuna), another ruling symbol. ʻʽAʻū/bonito schools announce successful voyaging and abundance, hinting at either fishing prowess or ocean governance.

• The phrase ʻ""ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo""ʻ indicates that chiefly father and son are not merely victims of physical aggression but are spiritually overpowered. ʻk ā puleʻ in older sources means “prayer/spell/ritual utterance,” conveying that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo is deploying sorcery, counter-magic, or mākāʻu (awe-inducing power). This positions him as an ʻānai-aupuni (destroyer of established rule) rather than a simple vandal, signaling the transition of the story from domestic struggle into larger cosmological shifts—very much in the paradigm of the ʻAi Kapu breakdown.

• Their identities as father and son repeat the generational dichotomy we have seen: old order (Nā-maka-o-kalani the father) versus emergent era (his son) collapsed simultaneously under the potency of the child-hero—a temporal telescoping typical in moʻōlelo kālaikapa (layered narratives where time folds upon itself).

• By folding two high-chiefs of an independent land (Hawaiʻi proper) within Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo’s sphere of influence, the narrator foreshadows that the boy’s destructive actions with humble sweet potatoes eventually echo in the destruction or usurpation of real kingdoms, underscoring the allegory: the end of kapu-bound leadership and the dawn of a new socio-religious epoch.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Puali'i's head said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Farewell to you, Nāmakaokapāo'o.""

• **Prayer as Precedent to Violence** – In Hawaiian tradition, the act of prayer (pule) serves multiple functions at this critical juncture:
   – First, by finishing his prayer, Nāmakaokapāo'o fulfills ritual protocol before the supernatural event
   – The timing (""i ia wā"") creates dramatic tension typical of Hawaiian narrative structure, where action follows immediately upon sacred invocations
   – This follows traditional Hawaiian martial protocol: before great conflict, warriors might offer prayers to their family gods (ʻaumakua) for victory

• **The Reversed Axe (koʻilipi)** – The weapon's transformation carries profound symbolic significance:
   – Koʻilipi (iron axe) represents Western technology and authority, marking this as a post-contact narrative
   – The ""moe ā huli"" (turning motion) of the axe blade suggests divine intervention, specifically from Nāmakaokapāo'o's ancestral deities
   – This reversal mirrors other Hawaiian stories where weapons betray their wielders when used unjustly, such as in the tale of Pakaʻa or Kaululāʻau

• **Decapitation and Speech** – The trope of the speaking head appears throughout Polynesian literature:
   – In Hawaiian cosmology, the head (poʻo) houses the spirit (ʻuhane) which retains consciousness momentarily after death
   – Puali'i's ""aloha ʻoe"" represents a formal, respectful farewell appropriate between family members, acknowledging the sacredness of their relationship
   – The distance (""elima mile"") specified is notably Western measurement, again suggesting post-contact context

• **Final Disposition at Waipouli** – The significance of Waipouli (dark water) cave requires deeper analysis:
   – Waipouli likely derives from ""waipou-"" (water + dark) + ""-li"" (perfective) = ""darkened water""
   – Caves (ana) in Hawaiian belief systems often serve as entrances to the underworld (lua o milu)
   – The five-mile measurement suggests this is a significant geographical feature, possibly a lava tube or submarine cave system
   – In 'Ai Kapu tradition, disposal of remains thus prevents proper burial rituals (kanu), denying Puali'i entry into the ancestral realm
   – This action effectively removes Puali'i's mana (spiritual power) from the land, symbolizing the severing of the old order represented by strict 'Ai Kapu adherence

• **Allegorical Reading**: This scene represents the overthrow of the old generation's values by the new. Puali'i, champion of the 'Ai Kapu system, is destroyed by the very tools (koʻilipi) of the new era. The child's super-natural protection suggests divine favor for progressive change. The casting of the head into the ""dark water"" symbolizes plunging backward-looking traditionalism into the unconscious depths, while Nāmakaokapāo'o – whose name connects to the pāo'o fish that signifies going against the current – represents forward movement.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

Nāmakaokapāo'o would not eat any food. At that time there was living 'Ama'u, a chief of O'ahu, residing in Waikīkī. A man from Honouliuli went up to Waikīkī where the chief was living. He said, “O Chief! A little boy of surpassing strength is dwelling at place X, his father has died and his head has been thrown far out to sea, a great distance, five miles offshore.” When 'Ama'u heard this he said, “When I pit my strength against his I will be killed by him, but unless I do fight him I will in no way be his equal.” While he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o heard these very words concerning himself.","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",

When the mother had disappeared into concealment, he returned home to their house at Keahumoa and dwelt there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the ridgepole of the house, uncovered the thatching of the back and front, and lay down right in the middle on the ridgepole.","**Paragraph 11:** • This paragraph marks Nāmakaokapāo'o's first act of violence directed toward his parent. In Hawaiian tradition, filial rebellion is a powerful omen indicating the collapse of established order, particularly when the child's action is preceded by divine or supernatural events; – The concealment in Wai-pouli (dark water) cave represents the traditional motif of temporary ""return to the womb""—the womb being both a place of concealment (pouli) and potential rebirth. This act foreshadows Pōka'ī's future reemergence as a changed being in subsequent chapters; • Nāmakaokapāo'o's action of dismantling the house's thatch (mau'u: specifically grass thatching) carries deep cultural significance: – The ridgepole (kua-ve'e or kaupoku) represents the spine of the 'ohana (family), with the thatch (kua and alo) representing the protection and concealment of ancestral knowledge. By uncovering it, Nāmakaokapāo'o violates both physical and spiritual boundaries; – The act of lying on the ridgepole places him in the position of a hostile mo'o (spirit guardian) or 'aumākua who has reversed the natural order by claiming the central axis of the household instead of protecting it; • The sequence (concealment → return → violation of house boundaries) mirrors the heiau destruction practices where sacred spaces were first desecrated by removal of their protective coverings (kāhili, thatching) before more complete destruction. This suggests Nāmakaokapāo'o serves as a literal agent of kapu system dissolution; • The body of the house (kino o ka hale) is personified, making Nāmakaokapāo'o's action not merely destructive but cannibalistic—he ""consumes"" the family's protective spiritual structure by lying inside its exposed spine. This connects to his earlier actions of consuming the māla 'uala and prefigures the consumptive violence threatened by Puali'i.","Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

When they arrived at the plains of Keahumoa, they entered into the house—no one was there. As they were about to leave, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from the rooftop. They heard the voice but could not see the body and asked, ""Where are you who calls out?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""Here I am above."" Eight men climbed up, four at the back of the house and four at the front of the house, and they found Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""What brings you here?"" They said, ""We have come to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o, a small child just like you, who is very strong and brave, the very one who killed his father, Puali'i.""","**Paragraph 12:** • The number symbolism continues in this passage: 4 groups × 4 = 16, and 48 × 4 = 192 warriors total (with 4 × 8 = 32 who actually ascend). These groups of four (the sacred number) represent the four major islands or four quadrants of the cosmos, suggesting this is not merely a local conflict but carries cosmic significance;

– 'Ama'u (the mother-of-pearl, a type of fern) as chief-name suggests a connection to liminal spaces and transformation—ferns grow in transitional areas between land types, and mother-of-pearl appears on shells that transform into tools/ornaments. His dispatch from Waikīkī (spouting water) likely indicates he represents old-order authority from the productive Kona coast region;

• The warriors' methodical entry into the empty house followed by calling up to the rooftop reflects the traditional protocol of house-visiting, inverted here—the boy observes the warriors rather than vice-versa. The house structure (back/front, above/below) replicates the three-part Hawaiian cosmos (pō, 'āina, lani) with Nāmakaokapāo'o occupying the most elevated position (lani/the heavens);

– Their identification of Nāmakaokapāo'o as ""he wahi keiki 'u'uku"" (a certain small child) contrasted with his actual presence above them suggests the traditional motif of underestimating the trickster-hero. The warriors' statement that this small child killed his father carries double meaning: Puali'i (the stepfather) was ""father"" by marriage but not by blood, indicating Nāmakaokapāo'o has in fact destroyed the old Ai Kapu order represented by Puali'i;

• The warriors' inability to see Nāmakaokapāo'o's body despite hearing his voice suggests he operates partially in a different realm/dimension—a common signifier in Hawaiian narratives for persons of divine heritage who can access the akua realm. His strategic positioning above them indicates his tactical superiority even before physical confrontation begins.","Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, ""Where is that voice coming from?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I'm up here."" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""What in the world are you all doing here?"" They said, ""We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.""","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

They said, ""No, you are the one, that's what we've heard. Therefore, you shall be killed by us, you will not live."" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied, ""Let us indeed go down below to fight."" When they reached below, Nāmakaokapāo'o struck out, and they all perished, with just one man remaining, the one who fled and reached 'Ama'u at Waikīkī. He told of their total annihilation, and that only he survived as the messenger to inform 'Ama'u.","**Paragraph 13:** • The scene shifts to a dramatic confrontation where Nāmakaokapāo'o faces a death sentence based on mistaken identity – ironically, when he truthfully claims to be ""merely a name"" (he inoa) rather than the legendary figure, this very disclosure confirms his identity. The phrase he inoa nona carries profound cultural weight, as Hawaiian personal names function as inextricable extensions of the person, containing their mana, history, and destiny. – This moment reflects the Hawaiian concept of 'inoa pō (name from the night), where true identity transcends physical presence; 

• The adversaries' refusal to accept Nāmakaokapāo'o's distinction between the name and the person reveals the fatalistic nature of name magic in Hawaiian cosmology. To be named is to be that person, regardless of the speaker's intent. Their pronouncement e make ana 'oe iā mākou formalizes the death sentence with the protocol-laden grammar typical of retributive justice in 'Ai Kapu society;

• The invitation to ""go down below"" (ho'i aku ho'i hā kākou i lalo) for combat follows the traditional protocol for settling disputes through single combat in designated areas, typically below (i lalo) wahi kapu or in areas removed from sacred spaces. The phrase hā kākou (indeed, emphatically, let us) signals acceptance of the challenge with full knowledge of the consequences;

• Nāmakaokapāo'o's annihilation of his opponents (pau loa i ka make) demonstrates his divine warrior nature, aligning with ancestral accounts of superhuman combatants like Kamehameha's legendary battles. The survival of precisely one individual as messenger follows Hawaiian narrative convention – the lone witness ensures transmission of events while serving justice; the survivor's name 'Ama'u (a climbing fern known for tenacious growth) metaphorically represents the persistence of information through peril.

• The journey to Waikīkī continues the geographic threading of the narrative, moving from Ko'olau toward 'Ewa's southern coast, establishing the legendary landscape as precisely mapped territory. That the sole survivor carries news to 'Ama'u (present Ali'i of whichever district/social grouping is opposing Nāmakaokapāo'o) signifies the formal protocol where messengers bearing news of defeat must run directly to their chief, often along established messenger paths known as ala hele ku'ukū. The designation 'āha'ilono (messenger/rumor/spirit) confirms the interweaving of literal running messenger with supernatural communication, as Hawaiian history often records such runners as possessed or visionary figures.","Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him."" The soldiers said, ""No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive."" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""Well, let's go down and fight."" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

When 'Ama'u arrived at 'Ewa with his people, Nāmakaokapāo'o was continuously striking until all were gone, not a single person remained, and 'Ama'u died. The island of O'ahu was completely taken by Nāmakaokapāo'o, then he fetched his mother and established her upon the land here on O'ahu.","Paragraph 14: • The narrative reaches its moment of climactic consequence and territorial expansion. A new figure, 'Ama'u (the gathering/fetching of young taro leaves), arrives as a military leader - his name suggesting nourishment and sustenance, symbolic of agricultural abundance. His force of eighteen war canoes ('umi kumamāwalu) indicates both significant preparation and the customary practice of assembling fleets for major expeditions - the number eighteen carrying possible calendrical significance (three sixes, the number of days in the Hawaiian week doubled plus four, as months often have four weeks).

– 'Ama'u sails i lalo o 'Ewa (downward to 'Ewa), following the traditional directional system of mauka/makai and the flow of water, suggesting both literal descent from upland areas and the lowering of his people's fortune. The location 'Ewa, here portrayed as under Nāmakaokapāo'o's control, historically represents the fruitful plains of central O'ahu and serves as a strategic point for controlling the entire island.

- The phrase luku ā pau loa (utter destruction until complete) mirrors ancient descriptions of total warfare and land clearance. The term luku specifically refers to the complete annihilation or destruction of a place - often used in chants describing volcanic eruptions, war conquest, or the clearing of brush for planting. The emphatic nature of this destruction ('a'ohe kanaka koe - not even one person remained) suggests the breaking down of the old order to prepare for new governance.

- Following complete conquest, Nāmakaokapāo'o performs the crucial cultural act of ho'onoho (installing/placing) his mother upon the land. This action references the ancient practice of a victorious ali'i establishing his most trusted relative - usually a parent or grandparent - as kuhina nui or regent of newly conquered territory. The phrase luna o ka 'āina represents both literal elevation to positions of authority and spiritual elevation of the land itself under new management.

- The use of nei (here) in 'O'ahu nei creates an intimate connection between the narrator (land) and the reader - suggesting the story was told to local descendants of those who experienced these events. This rhetorical device marks the transition from personal vendetta to imperial conquest, elevating Nāmakaokapāo'o from child avenger to island ruler - embodying the Hawaiian understanding that those who control ancestral lands through warfare must honor the maternal ancestral line to maintain sovereignty.","When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
