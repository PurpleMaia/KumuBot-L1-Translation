There was no one like him on these islands from Hawaiʻi to Niʻihau in both his small stature and his bravery. His father was Kauluakahaʻi, from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinuʻu. His mother was Pōkaʻī. His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he was also part god.","• Narrative structure and cultural context  
  – This opening paragraph follows the classic moʻolelo formula by presenting:  
    1) The protagonist’s name and physical attributes (a);  
    2) The names and statuses of his parents (b1, b2);  
    3) The geographical and cosmological origins of the family (c).  
  – Such introductions are characteristic of pre-contact Hawaiian heroic chants, where genealogy and supernatural connection establish a character’s mana and legitimacy.

• The hero: Nāmakaokapāoʻo (a)  
  – Etymology: nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo “the eyes of the pāoʻo.” The pāoʻo is a brightly colored fish; invoking its “eyes” suggests keen sight, vigilance, or an uncanny perception.  
  – Physique and prowess:  
    • “He keiki ʻuʻuku loa” (a very small child) yet “he keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ʻōpiopio” (exceedingly strong as a youth)  
    • “ʻAʻohe ona lua ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawaiʻi ā Niʻihau” (unmatched from Hawaiʻi to Niʻihau) – a pan-island superlative underscoring his unique combination of diminutive size and extraordinary courage  
  – Allegorical resonance: the paradox of small stature with vast strength prefigures the underdog-hero motif, common in Hawaiian tradition, where outward humility cloaks inner, often divine, power.

• The father: Kauluakahaʻi (b1, c)  
  – Name and genealogy: Kaulu-a-Kahaʻi “the inspiration (kaulu) of Kahaʻi,” linking him to the legendary hero Kahaʻi, who voyages to Kahiki (foreign lands) in other narratives.  
  – Origin:  
    • “No Kahikipapaialewa” – a stratum of Kahiki situated aloft, representing a celestial foreign land; Kahikipapaialewa often appears in chants to locate chiefs within a cosmic geography.  
    • Kahikinuʻu “Kahiki at the summit,” reinforcing the notion of Kahiki as both a physical and mythic realm.  
  – Status and divinity:  
    • “He aliʻi nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa” – he is a high chief of that realm, affirming noble rank.  
    • “He ʻaoʻao akua kekahi ona” – he is part-god (a demigod), a common attribute in chiefly genealogies of the ʻAi Kapu era, which authorized and protected chiefly authority under the kapu system.

• The mother: Pōkaʻī (b2)  
  – Name etymology: possibly Pō (“darkness” or the primal night) + kaʻi (“to lead,” “to steer,” “to encompass”), suggesting a role as hinge or guide between realms.  
  – Narrative role: though no further description is given, inclusion of the mother’s name emphasizes bilateral genealogy and acknowledges her part in the hero’s lineage, a practice that foregrounds both paternal and maternal descent in Hawaiian thought.

• Broader cultural implications  
  – Genealogical presentations such as this anchored chiefly lines in both earthly and cosmic orders, linking human leaders to the gods and to foreign (Kahiki) origins.  
  – The juxtaposition of “ʻuʻuku” and “koa” (smallness and valor) in one individual reflects Hawaiian values that esteem inner strength and resourcefulness over mere physical dominance.  
  – By tracing descent to Kahikipapaialewa, the text situates Nāmakaokapāoʻo within an otherworldly narrative realm, setting the stage for exploits that transcend ordinary island life and engage with the supernatural.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This opening chapter of the Nāmakaokapāoʻo cycle weaves together themes of sacred genealogy, ritual authority, and the violent assertion of chiefly power, set against a richly delineated ʻāina landscape that spans from Kahikipapaialewa in Kahikinuʻu (par. 1) through Hō‘ae‘ae of ʻEwa (par. 2), Honouliuli (pars. 3–4, 9), Waipouli Bay (pars. 9–11), and Keahumoa (pars. 4–5, 11–14).  From the outset, Nāmakaokapāoʻo is presented as a paradoxical figure—“very small” yet “exceedingly strong,” unique among the islands from Hawaiʻi to Niʻihau (par. 1).  His birth unites the divine–chiefly line of Kauluakahaʻi, a part-god high chief, with Pōkaʻī, whose subsequent “dishonor” at childbirth (par. 2) introduces a recurring motif of shame and the disruption of rank.

Major Themes and Allegory  
1. Genealogical Legitimacy versus Usurpation:  The narrative sets up a binary between rightful hereditary authority (Kauluakahaʻi and his son) and the opportunistic outsider, Puali‘i of Līhuʻe (pars. 3–4).  Puali‘i’s demand for first eating rights through a binding kapu formula (“Puali‘i shall eat first, and then…the others may eat,” par. 4) allegorizes the monopolization of ritual privilege, only to be violently overturned by the boy he seeks to subordinate.  
2. Kapu and Its Transgression:  The sweet-potato patches named Nāmakaokapāoʻo become a locus for the collision of sacred order and its inversion.  When the boy uproots the ‘uala vines (par. 5–6) and roasts them in open defiance of Puali‘i’s ritual hierarchy, he not only subverts the kapu system but prefigures the broader dismantling of inherited religious strictures.  
3. Ritual Power and Divine Aid:  The death-chant (par. 7–8) invokes two supreme chiefs—Nāmakaokalani (the father) and Nāmakaokai‘a (the son)—penetrating the world of gods and spirits.  This pule exemplifies the traditional Hawaiian belief in genealogically anchored mana, which empowers an ostensibly helpless child to slay his oppressor (pars. 9–10).

Historical and Cultural Context  
– Place-name precision (e.g., Kahikipapaialewa, Keahumoa, Honouliuli, Waipouli) reflects an 19th-century Hawaiian-language style that anchors mythic action in lived geography, a feature common to contemporaneous newspaper serials in *Ka Nūpepa Kūʻokoʻa* and *Ke Alakaʻi O Hawaiʻi*.  
– The chapter’s sustained emphasis on kapu rites, coupled with the boy’s ultimate transgression, suggests a post-1819 reflection on the abolition of the ʻAi Kapu system.  While no explicit Christian moralizing appears, the narrative’s valorization of righteous revolt against ritual monopoly resonates with colonial-era critiques of “heathen” kapu.  
– The recurring motif of ingested head-meat (pars. 4, 9) and the speaking severed head recall archaic practices of utu (revenge offerings) and headhunting, situating the tale firmly in a pre-missionary, warrior culture that valorizes personal honor and sacrificial violence.

Chapter Significance in Hawaiian Literature  
This chapter inaugurates the hero’s journey by combining the intimate domestic sphere (Pōkaʻī’s shame, par. 2) with epic-scale warfare (defeat of ʻAmaʻu’s four war parties and the final conquest of Oʻahu, pars. 12–14).  It exemplifies the fusion of oral genealogy, ritual formulae, and place-based poetics characteristic of late 19th-century Hawaiian narrative prose.  By portraying a child of mixed divine and mortal parentage who rises to supreme power, the text participates in a wider Polynesian tradition of demi-god culture heroes while also encoding contemporary debates over chiefly legitimacy, land tenure, and the sanctity of kapu.

Political Implications and Temporal Layering  
Though likely composed in the post-coup environment of the 1890s—when pro-American newspapers often republished traditional legends—the story’s focus on rightful versus usurped authority can be read as an allegorical critique of illegitimate rule.  The overthrow of Puali‘i, the outsider, by genealogical heir Nāmakaokapāoʻo parallels the 1893 deposition of Queen Lili‘uokalani and the subsequent struggle over sovereignty.  In this light, the narrative may have functioned to reaffirm indigenous concepts of chiefly order, in opposition to colonial interventions that sought to supplant Hawaiian legal and religious structures.

In sum, Chapter 1 of the Nāmakaokapāoʻo cycle offers a richly contextualized mythic account that not only establishes its hero’s superhuman origins and martial prowess but also engages deeply with themes of kapu transgression, genealogical legitimacy, and the political consequences of usurpation—thereby laying the groundwork for a tale that resonates with both ancient Hawaiian cultural paradigms and the fraught colonial transformations of the late 19th century."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. A hāpai ‘o Pōka‘ī iā   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i i kona  ‘āina, noho ihola ‘o Pōka‘ī me kona hāpai, a ma hope, hānau. Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o  Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","The land of Hō‘ae‘ae in ʻEwa was the place where the two became united in the flesh, and in that sleeping together Nāmakaokapāoʻo was conceived. Pōkaʻī then carried Nāmakaokapāoʻo; Kauluakahaʻi returned to his own land; Pōkaʻī remained alone with her pregnancy and afterward gave birth. At that birth, Pōkaʻī and her child Nāmakaokapāoʻo were deeply dishonored.","Paragraph 2:
• Locative framing and its resonance  
  – “‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ʻEwa ka ʻāina” follows the classical Hawaiian narrative formula of naming the precise ‘āina (land) where events unfold.  
  – Hō‘ae‘ae (“to break the riffles”) on the reef flats of ‘Ewa suggests a liminal zone between land and sea, symbolically rich for themes of conception and transformation.  

• Intimacy outside formal kapu structures  
  – “launa kino ai me ka moe ʻana iho” employs two related terms for sexual union: “launa kino” (physical intimacy) and “moe ʻana iho” (lying together), underlining the consensual but unsanctioned nature of their union.  
  – During the ‘Ai Kapu era (pre-1819), sexual relations among ali‘i required strict observance of ritual protocols; here, the absence of formal ceremony foreshadows social repercussions.  

• Conception and the language of obtaining life  
  – The passive phrase “ā loa‘a ‘o Nāmakaokapāoʻo” (“by that means was Nāmakaokapāoʻo obtained”) is a common poetic construction for conception, aligning the event with other mythic origins.  
  – “Hāpai ‘o Pōka‘ī iā Nāmakaokapāoʻo” highlights Pōka‘ī’s sole burden of gestation, distancing Kauluakaha‘i from the maternal sphere and signaling her vulnerability.  

• Gender roles, displacement, and isolation  
  – Kauluakaha‘i’s departure—“ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i i kona ʻāina”—inverts typical ali‘i marriage patterns, in which women customarily moved to their husband’s estate. His return home leaves Pōka‘ī “noho ihola” (to remain alive, literally), emphasizing both her physical endurance and social solitude.  
  – This separation underscores the precarious status of women whose unions fall outside kapu-sanctioned alliances, leaving mother and child exposed.  

• The birth event and “‘ilihune loa”  
  – “Ma kēia hānau ʻana” marks the climactic moment of parturition, a time especially fraught with kapu concerning maternal and infant purity.  
  – The term “‘ilihune loa” conveys profound dishonor or ignoble status—“loa” intensifying “‘ilihune” (low-born, despised). In the ‘Ai Kapu context, a child born outside a properly sanctioned union could be stigmatized, and the mother’s rank diminished.  

• Allegorical dimensions  
  – On one level, this passage dramatizes the social consequences of breaching sexual and ritual kapu: the very lifegiver and her offspring are cast into shame.  
  – Symbolically, the disgrace foreshadows the impending collapse of the ‘Ai Kapu system—just as Pōka‘ī and Nāmakaokapāoʻo must struggle against inherited dishonor, Hawaiian society itself is on the brink of transcending rigid taboos and embracing a new order.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p3,1,3,"Iā lāua e noho ana, iho maila ‘o Puali‘i, he  kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e, i ka lawai‘a ma kai o  Honouliuli, kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka‘ī.

A ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘ī me kāna kāne me  Puali‘i ā ke kula o Keahumoa, noho.","While the two were living there, Puali‘i—a good man from Līhu‘e who had gone fishing off Honouliuli—came down and visited Pōka‘ī’s house. Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and desired her, saying, “I want you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī replied, “How can you want me? I have borne a child, and my body is blemished.” Puali‘i answered, “Those things mean nothing. If you want me, let us lie together.” Pōka‘ī agreed, and she went with Puali‘i—now her kāne (husband/partner)—to dwell on the plain of Keahumoa.","• Introduction of a new protagonist, Pua-li‘i (Pua “child/descendant” + ali‘i “chief”):
  – “he kanaka maika‘i” marks him as a man of good character and high standing.  
  – Origin: Līhu‘e (district of Wāhiāwā, Kaua‘i), noted for its rich fisheries. His arriving by sea to Honouliuli (ʻEwa, Oʻahu) follows the common practice of traveling by canoe and “calling in” (kipa) at local households.

• The custom of hospitality (‘Imi ʻAi & Ai ‘Ai Kapu era context):
  – Pōka‘ī receives Puali‘i into her hale, illustrating the Hawaiian duty of aloha and generosity to strangers—integral during the ‘Ai Kapu period when refusal to host was a grave breach of etiquette.  
  – The visitor’s right to request food, water, or lodging underlines reciprocal bonds (ho‘okipa) that underpin mo‘olelo across the islands.

• Courtship proposal and status of women’s bodies under Kapu:
  – Puali‘i’s direct “Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u” employs wahine na‘u (“my woman”) as a formal offer of partnership—both romantic and socio-political.  
  – Pōka‘ī’s objection: “Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino.” In the ‘Ai Kapu schema, women in menstruation or recent childbirth were kapu (sacredly prohibited) and feared to be noa (‘ino‘ino, “defiled”). She believes her māhū (postpartum state) renders her unfit for union.  
  – Puali‘i’s retort—“He mea ‘ole ia mau mea”—rejects those kapu restrictions. Allegorically, this anticipates the abolition of the ‘Ai Kapu (1819) when Liholiho (Kamehameha II) declared the ‘Ai Noa, freeing women’s bodies from those ancient prohibitions.

• Establishment of conjugal status:
  – Pōka‘ī consents and goes “me kāna kāne”—using kāne as husband/long-term partner, formalizing their relationship in Hawaiian terms rather than Western notions of marriage.  
  – The couple relocates to Ke-ahu­moa (“heap of fowl” or “pile of chickens”):  
    · Place-name symbolism: chickens (moa) connote fertility and abundance, suggesting that their union will renew the ‘aina’s productivity and seed new lineages.  
    · Geographical mobility here reflects social mobility and re-formation of kinship ties across districts.

• Allegorical and cultural significance:
  – Puali‘i’s acceptance of Pōka‘ī despite her child mirrors the integration of blended families and the Hawaiian ideal of extended ‘ohana, transcending older kapu that once isolated postpartum women.  
  – This passage, set against the backdrop of ‘Ai Kapu customs, functions as an early narrative signal of imminent social change: the dismantling of rigid purity laws and the inauguration of a more inclusive social order.  
  – The movement from Honouliuli to Keahumoa charts a personal journey that reflects the larger transformation in Hawaiian society—from strict ritual prohibitions to a renewed aloha ‘āina where people of all states are embraced equally.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

No laila, iho akula ‘o Puali‘i i kai  o Honouliuli e lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala.","They lived continuously in that place, cultivating food, leaving behind two long sweet potato gardens that remain to this day; those gardens have been called Nāmakaokapāo‘o ever since. And when the sweet potatoes were ready, Puali‘i made his binding declaration, saying, “Here is cooked the head of the ulua with the sweet potato—Puali‘i shall eat first, and then, the kapu is lifted, and my wife Pōka‘ī and the others may eat.” Afterward, Puali‘i went down to the waters of Honouliuli to fish for more food to eat together with the sweet potatoes.","• Continuous Settlement and Agriculture  
  – “Noho ihola i laila, mahi ʻai”: The phrase emphasizes uninterrupted habitation and a self-sustaining economy based on cultivation. In many mo‘olelo, this wording signals that the ʻohana has not migrated but has put down roots in the ahupuaʻa.  
  – “‘Elua āna mau māla ʻuala lō‘ihi”: The two long patches of ʻuala (‘uala lō‘ihi) suggest both abundance and careful land division. The number two often implies dual principles—perhaps mauka/makai or male/female aspects of fertility.

• Eponymous Place-Naming as Genealogical Claim  
  – “Ua kapa ʻia ka inoa … ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o”: Assigning the name of the aliʻi (or demi-god child) to the land is a common means of cementing genealogical rights and mana in traditional Hawai‘i. By calling the gardens Nāmakaokapāo‘o “to this day,” the text underscores a living connection between ancestor and ʻāina.

• The ʻAi Kapu Meal Ritual and Ho‘ohiki (Oath)  
  – “‘Ōlelo ʻo Puali‘i i kāna ʻōlelo hoʻōhiki”: Puali‘i’s statement functions as a ho‘ohiki—a vow that establishes the order of eating and affirms social hierarchy.  
    • “Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ʻuala”: Cooking the head (po‘o) of the ulua fish alongside sweet potato echoes sacrificial language from the ‘Ai Kapu era. According to Pukui & Elbert (1986:369), ulua were used as a substitute for human sacrifices in heiau rites—a powerful metaphor here.  
    • “A ‘ai ‘o Puali‘i, a laila, noa, ‘ai kāna wahine, Pōka‘ī a me nā mea ‘ē aʻe”: The sequence—ali‘i eats first, then noa (kapu lifted), then women and commoners—mirrors the strict eating protocols of the ‘Ai Kapu system. Even though the narrative occurs after the abolition of the ‘Ai Kapu, invoking this pattern reinforces Puali‘i’s status as kāne ali‘i and head of the household.

• Symbolic Resonances of Head, Fish, and Sweet Potato  
  – The “head of the ulua” symbolizes both consumption and regeneration: in ritual contexts, the head stands for the tuber (po‘o) and the eyes for the vine cuttings (maka) used to replant. Coupling with ʻuala thus becomes an allegory for life’s cyclical nature—harvest and renewal.

• Integration of Land (Māla) and Sea (Kai) in Subsistence Economy  
  – “Iho akula ʻo Puali‘i i kai o Honouliuli e lawaiʻa”: After formalizing the meal with ʻuala and ulua, Puali‘i returns to fish in Honouliuli’s rich waters. This illustrates the classic ahupuaʻa model: mauka cultivation supports makai fishing, ensuring food security and social cohesion.

• Allegorical Layer: Forward-Looking vs. Rückwärts-gewandt  
  – In earlier paragraphs, Nāmakaokapāo‘o (the boy) embodied progressive abandonment of ‘Ai Kapu strictures, while Puali‘i represented adherence to ritual. Here, the naming of the gardens after the boy—coupled with Puali‘i’s re-enactment of a formal meal—suggests a synthesis: the community retains the structural memory of ritual hierarchy even as it moves beyond literal sacrificial practices.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s body then was very small—just two spans plus a bit of extra height—and his illness no longer held him; he moved about freely. When they arrived at that sweet-potato patch, he said to the children, “Pull up the hill with all its ‘uala vines completely—leave none growing.” But the children were frightened, so they gently held back from the vines and did not pull up the hill.","• Context and Setting  
  – This scene follows Puali‘i’s departure to fish, leaving Nāmakaokapāo‘o in charge of the ‘uala (sweet-potato) patch. In traditional Hawaiian life, clearing and tending ‘uala patches could be communal work, often with children as helpers under the direction of an elder or a more powerful youth.  
  – The reference to “nā keiki he ‘umi kumamāhiku” (the seventeen children) situates Nāmakaokapāo‘o among a cohort. The number 17 (he ‘umi kumamāhiku) may carry symbolic weight—linking to lunar cycles (17 half-months) or mythic genealogies—suggesting this is more than casual child’s play.  

• Description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s Body  
  – “he kino ‘u‘uku loa, ‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e”:  
    • kapua‘i = “span” (Pukui & Elbert 1986:214), a measure from thumb to little finger when spread; two spans plus a fraction indicates extreme smallness, marking him still very much a child in stature.  
    • The extra “hapa kona ki‘eki‘e” (a fraction of height) underscores his precocious but still diminutive form.  
  – “‘a‘ole i pa‘a kona ma‘i, e lewalewa ana nō”: his malady or “disease” (ma‘i) no longer confines him; he is “lewalewa,” floating or free—an idiom for having recovered strength or being unbound. This freedom contrasts with the children’s fear-driven restraint.  

• The Command to Uproot the ‘Uala  
  – “E huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala ā pau loa i luna, mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana.”  
    • huhuki = to pull up by the roots; pu‘e = hill or mound (of sweet potatoes); lau = leaves or vines.  
    • Complete uprooting of the vines is atypical: normally one harvests tubers selectively, leaving vines to continue producing or to decompose for soil fertility. Here, the order is total destruction.  
  – This radical command marks Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s agency and precocity. Despite his small stature, he adopts an adult-like authority—an inversion of the typical child-adult hierarchy.  

• Children’s Reaction and Cultural Implications  
  – “maka‘u nō ua keiki”: genuine fear grips the children. This may reflect:  
    • Awe of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s uncanny prowess—he who overcame illness now wields authority.  
    • Knowledge of ritual or agricultural protocol: they sense that total destruction of a staple crop violates norms, especially in the ‘Ai Kapu era when specific foods and crops were kapu (forbidden) under certain circumstances.  
  – Their “kāohi mālie” (quiet restraint) signals communal deference; they obey social protocol even in fear, pausing the destructive act.  

• Allegorical Interpretation  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a harbinger of change: his small body but commanding will prefigures a shift—perhaps an allegory for dismantling old orders (suited to the overthrow of the ‘Ai Kapu system).  
  – The sweet-potato mound symbolizes sustenance and traditional practice; ordering its total removal may allude to the dismantling of kapu restrictions around food, land use, or social hierarchy.  
  – The children’s hesitation represents the broader community’s fear of breaking with tradition—even when led by a powerful, transformative figure.  

• Name Etymology and Symbolism  
  – Nāmaka-o-ka-pāo‘o (“the eyes of the pāo‘o [fish/bird]”): eyes denote vision or foresight; pāo‘o may imply a swift, elusive creature. Here, his “vision” commands radical action.  
  – The fractioned height (kapua‘i plus hapa) mirrors his name: small yet perceptive, limited in stature but expansive in will.  

• Relation to Wider Narrative  
  – This episode parallels Chapter 1, Paragraphs 3–4, where Puali‘i’s earlier anger and threats at the ‘uala patches foreshadow conflict over food sovereignty. Now that Puali‘i is absent, Nāmakaokapāo‘o steps in—not to defend but to dismantle.  
  – The tension between children’s fear and Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s resolve sets the stage for ensuing drama—will the community side with preservation or collapse?","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

The heap of foliage from the two patches numbered forty in all. Then Nāmakaokapāoʻ o went back to build a fire, and he broiled four sweet-potato vines over the blazing coals until they withered. While he was roasting them, his stepfather, Pualiʻi, arrived and asked his mother, Pōkaʻ ī, for her consent. She answered, “No.” But Pualiʻi replied, “Yes. It is his head and his eyes that will serve as relish for my sweet potatoes today. Therefore, this is the day he shall die for me.”","• Destructive labor and agricultural imagery  
  – The verb noke “to work diligently” combined with huhuki “to pull up/root out” conveys Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s relentless effort to dismantle the ‘uala (sweet-potato) patches. Uprooting the vines signifies more than mere mischief; it symbolizes the removal of both subsistence and lineage-bearing elements from the soil.  
  – The outcome—“he kanahā āhua ka nui o nā māla ʻelua” (“forty in number”)—uses kanahā (four tens) to punctuate the scale of destruction. In Hawaiian numerology, tens often mark completeness or a cycle; here, forty may allude to an exhaustive end of an old order.

• The four vines and the fire ritual  
  – The four (‘ehā) vines chosen for roasting represent a deliberate selection. In a traditional context, vines (ʻau) are the propagative “eyes” of the ‘uala; to roast them is to nullify future renewal.  
  – Fire (ahi) serves both purgative and transformative functions in Hawaiian ritual. By broiling the vines (‘ōhinu akula), Nāmakaokapāoʻo enacts a rite of finality, sealing the fate of the old kapu-bound agricultural practice.

• Arrival and exchange between Pōkaʻ ī and Pualiʻi  
  – Pualiʻi’s return and his question to Pōkaʻ ī (“‘Aʻole?”) tests her allegiance: will she protect her son or yield to her husband’s demand? Her negative reply affirms maternal resistance to violence.  
  – Pualiʻi’s response—affirming that Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s head (poʻo) and eyes (maka) shall be the ‘īnaʻi (relish) for his meal—invokes a grim subversion of the ‘Ai Kapu sacrificial system. In that era, the head of an ulua fish often stood in for a human sacrifice on the heiau; Pualiʻi now proposes an actual human head and eyes in place of fishing offerings.

• Name-symbolism and allegory  
  – Nāmaka-o-ka-pāoʻo (“eyes of the pāoʻo fish”) carries its own semantic weight: his very name suggests vision and foresight. Pualiʻi’s threat to eat his “maka” (eyes) is thus a symbolic attempt to extinguish any insight or future-oriented impulse.  
  – The conflict dramatizes two temporal poles: Pualiʻi clings to the archaic ‘Ai Kapu order, demanding human sacrifice at the banquet; Nāmakaokapāoʻo, by uprooting and roasting the vines, allegorically pushes toward a new era of agricultural self-sufficiency and the end of ritualized killing.

• Cultural and historical echoes  
  – The entire scene resonates with the tensions preceding the kapu system’s abolition in 1819. Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s radical tearing out of the ‘uala mirrors the social upheaval that would soon tear down rigid kapu prohibitions.  
  – Pualiʻi’s invocation of head and eyes as meal garnishes recalls chants and stories where consuming a foe’s head confers mana; here, the threat backfires, exposing the brutality inherent in maintaining the old order.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

When all the children saw him, they ran off and stood far away, fearful of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey! Here is the cleaver in my hand, the tool to chop off your head today. Your head will then be cooked with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat it first—and afterward you will be released.”  
Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no heed to Puali‘i’s words, so Puali‘i spoke again a second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut off Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head with the cleaver, and at that moment Nāmakaokapāo‘o began his death-chant prayer for Puali‘i. It ran as follows:

“Beloved indeed are the eyes of my Pāo‘o,  
Swell up, be held fast—  
Whether eaten or left alone,  
Whether left alone Nākukui‘aimakaokalani.  
That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,  
This is my brother dear.  
Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i.  
O writhe! O the ceaseless tumbling!  
Man indeed with the spear,  
The spear indeed with the drum—  
Nāmakaokapāo‘o indeed dies.”","• Context and Narrative Action  
  – This paragraph climaxes the violent confrontation first foreshadowed in Paragraph 6, when Puali‘i threatened to eat Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head and eyes with sweet potatoes (cf. Example 3). Here Puali‘i finally advances with the ko‘ilipi (meat-cleaver), a tool both culinary and sacrificial.  
  – The children’s flight (“holo akula… no ka maka‘u ia Puali‘i”) illustrates Puali‘i’s dread-inspiring authority. In the ʻAi Kapu era, the fear of violent enforcement underlay many social taboos and punishments.

• Puali‘i’s Proclamation  
  – “Eia ke ko‘ilipi ma ku‘u lima” is a ritualized announcement of execution, paralleling the “eia” formula seen in Kū‘s heiau protocols (Pukui & Elbert 1986:247).  
  – The promise to cook (“kālua me ka ‘uala”) and eat the head first signals a perversion of normal eating practices. In ʻAi Kapu culture, human sacrifice to gods was sometimes ritually replaced with ulua fish (Pukui & Elbert 1986:369). Here, Puali‘i insists on actual flesh, upholding archaic sacrificial violence rather than its fish-substitute.  
  – The final clause “a laila, noa” implies a perverse “release from kapu” by death—only in passing does the word “noa” (common, free from taboo) recall its usual role as the complement to “kapu.”

• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s Death-Pray (Pule Make)  
  – Structure: The mele unfolds in two halves. The first summons cosmic and familial guardians (“Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,” “Kukui‘aimakaokalani,” “ku‘u wahi aikāne”) while the second shifts to martial imagery (“ihe,” “pahu”), ending in the stark affirmation of death.  
  – Name Etymologies and Invocation  
    * Nākukui‘aimakaokalani (“The light that kindles the heavenly eyes”): likely a divine or apotropaic deity invoked to witness or transform the impending death.  
    * Kukui‘aimakaokalani: a variant emphasizing the kukui (candlenut) light, itself a symbol of illumination and protection in Hawaiian ritual (Kamakau 1991:78).  
    * Nāmakaokai‘a (“The eyes of the kai‘a fish”): another facet-name of the youth, here raised to the status of “ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i,” aligning him posthumously with ruling chiefs and suggesting his passage from mortal child to exalted ancestor.  
  – Poetic Devices  
    * Repetition: “E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a”—calls for swelling and firm holding, perhaps a metaphor for the spirit’s anchoring in the cosmos rather than the severed body.  
    * Parallelism: “‘O kānaka nō me ka ihe / ‘O ka ihe nō me ka pahu” pairs man with weapon and weapon with drum, fusing the roles of warrior, executioner, and ritual performer.  
    * Imperative Verbs: “E he‘e,” “E hapupu‘u” animate the chant, making it both a plea and a declaration.  

• Cultural and Allegorical Interpretation  
  – The confrontation allegorizes the clash between a new, progressive order (represented by Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s energetic destruction of the sweet potato patches) and the old ʻAi Kapu regime (embodied by Puali‘i, the enforcer of grotesque sacrificial practices).  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s pule make is not only a personal farewell but a ritual act transforming him into an ancestral spirit (“ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i”), thereby ensuring that the vestiges of ʻAi Kapu—represented by Puali‘i’s cleaver—are sanctified in memory but unable to persist unchecked.  
  – The invocation of “noa” by Puali‘i and the reversal in Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prayer point to the ultimate collapse of strict kapu taboos in historical times, anticipating the 1819 abolition of the ʻAi Kapu system under Ka‘ahumanu and Kamehameha II.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Here we speak briefly of those two names—namely, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a. They are both great chiefs of Hawai‘i; Nāmakaokalani is the father and Nāmakaokai‘a is the child. Yet they entered into the pule (ritual service/prayer) of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","• Contextual Placement  
  – This sentence functions as a brief genealogical aside, a common feature in Hawaiian narrative, where the storyteller pauses the flow of the action to name related chiefs and clarify family ties.  
  – The connector “Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki…” signals a pivot back to lineage before resuming the main narrative about Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

• Name Etymologies and Symbolism  
  – Nāmakaokalani: literally “Nā-maka o ka-lani” (“the eyes of the heavens/sky”).  
     • Pukui & Elbert (1986:290) note “lani” connotes celestial or divine status; thus Nāmakaokalani evokes star-like vision or heavenly oversight.  
     • As a chief’s name, it suggests a ruler whose insight or authority is of cosmic scope.  
  – Nāmakaokai‘a: literally “Nā-maka o ka-i‘a” (“the eyes of the fish”).  
     • The term “i‘a” here implies vitality, abundance, or oceanic wealth—qualities a chiefly line might claim.  
     • It may also allude to the fish eyes used in ritual contexts, reinforcing a maritime dimension in their chiefly identity.

• Social Rank and Familial Roles  
  – Both figures are called “ali‘i nui” (high chiefs) of Hawai‘i, indicating the highest stratum of nobility in that island polity.  
  – The specification that Nāmakaokalani is the “makua kāne” (father) and Nāmakaokai‘a the “keiki” (child) reflects the Hawaiian emphasis on immediate parent–child links to establish hereditary rank and succession.

• “Komo i loko o ka pule”—Ritual Subordination  
  – The phrase “ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o” literally means “they went into the pule (prayer/ritual service) of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  
     • In a heiau context, to “enter the pule” can mean to become priest-participants or to swear fealty under a chief’s religious authority.  
     • It often implies accepting the kapu system administered by that chief and serving in his sacred rites.  
  – Here, the once-independent ali‘i nui submit themselves, indicating that even highborn lineages recognize the superior mana or divine mandate of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

• Allegorical and Cultural Resonances  
  – This nod to two great chiefs joining Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s pule can be read as an allegory for shifting political–religious power: cosmic (heavenly) and oceanic chiefs yielding to the emergent hero-demigod.  
  – It parallels larger Hawaiian history in the ‘Ai Kapu era, when various ali‘i invoked new cults or divine patrons to consolidate control.  
  – The text thus foreshadows Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s ascendancy, setting up the narrative of his own divine service and the transformations he will effect in the social and religious order.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p9,1,9,"A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o, i ia wā i  ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o, e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i  iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē.

The head fell away and, from a distance, spoke aloud.  Pualiʻi’s severed head answered Nāmakaokapāoʻo: “Aloha ʻoe, e Nāmakaokapāoʻo.”  Then Nāmakaokapāoʻo seized Pualiʻi’s head and flung it into the waters of Waipouli—a bay on the shore of Honouliuli stretching some five miles in length.","**Paragraph 9**  
• Contextual inversion of roles  
  – Earlier, Pualiʻi had threatened to eat Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s head and eyes as if they were ʻulu-ʻai (sweet potatoes) in an ‘Ai Kapu–style ritual. Here, immediately after Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s pule (prayer), Nāmakaokapāoʻo enacts the fatal blow upon Pualiʻi—turning the predator into prey and reversing the power dynamic.  

• Pule ('Prayer') as spiritual armament  
  – In traditional Hawaiian narrative, the pule invoked before combat or a decisive action channels the mana of akua. By concluding his pule, Nāmakaokapāoʻo summons divine sanction for what might otherwise appear as vengeance.  
  – This reflects the persistence of pre‐contact ritual structures: even in a narrative that allegorizes progress and the end of human sacrifice, the framework of prayer and divine permitting remains intact.  

• The act of cutting the ko‘ilipi  
  – Ko‘ilipi: in Pukui & Elbert (1986:176) “the cartilage or hanging flesh under the jaw.” Severing it at the “luna pono” (exact, fitting spot) underlines Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s extraordinary precision—echoing his earlier feats of strength and skill.  
  – Ke koʻi (adze‐blade) functions here as both tool and weapon, symbolizing the fine line between creation (clearing taro, carving wood) and destruction (beheading).  

• The speaking severed head  
  – The head’s ability to speak (“Aloha ʻoe, e Nāmakaokapāoʻo”) is a trope in Hawaiian moʻolelo signifying undiminished mana even after death. It recalls stories of demigods and kapu‐keepers whose power transcends physical destruction.  
  – The phrase “Aloha ʻoe” may also carry a double entendre—greeting Nāmakaokapāoʻo but intimating farewell, acknowledging the victor’s supreme authority.  

• Casting the head into Waipouli  
  – Waipouli (“dark/red water”) on the shore of Honouliuli: the place where Pualiʻi once fished and sought alliance with Pōkaʻī. Returning his head to these waters closes the narrative circle, cleansing the land of the transgression he attempted.  
  – The specified length—ʻelima mile (five miles)—echoes the numeric pattern from earlier paragraphs (2, 4, 40), perhaps alluding to the completeness of Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s triumph. In Hawaiian numerology, five (ʻelima) can symbolize integration of the full cycle of elements (earth, water, fire, wind, spirit).  

• Allegorical interpretation  
  – Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s decisive act marks the final abandonment of the old ‘Ai Kapu logic of threatening human heads as ritual food. Instead of offering Pualiʻi’s head as a substitute sacrifice, Nāmakaokapāoʻo casts it away—signifying a break with archaic customs and an embrace of a new order.  
  – The speaking head—once the source of terror—now pays homage to the hero, suggesting that any residual attachment to former sacrificial rites yields to the forward‐looking ethos embodied by Nāmakaokapāoʻo.  

• Name etymologies revisited  
  – Nāmaka-o-ka-pāo‘o (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o): “the eyes of the pāo‘o [fish],” denoting keen vision and hidden strength. His victory here reinforces the poetic power inherent in his name—seeing through threats and striking with divine precision.  
  – Puali‘i (Pua-li‘i): “child or descendant of a chief,” representing traditional chiefly authority and privilege. His downfall underscores the narrative’s critique of hereditary or ritual entitlement when divorced from righteous purpose.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p10,1,10,"A make ‘o Puali‘i, ho‘i akula ‘o   Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i kona makuahine, iā  Pōka‘ī, noho ihola lāua, ‘a‘ohe ‘ai o   Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ka ‘ai.

The two lived in destitution, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o had no food to eat. At that time, ‘Ama‘u, an ali‘i of O‘ahu, was residing at Waikīkī. A man came from Honouliuli to Waikīkī while the ali‘i was there. He said, “O chief! There is one very small yet exceedingly strong boy. His father has died, and his head was cast far out to sea—at a great distance of five miles. When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, ‘He truly has strength, and I will kill him; but if he had no strength, I would not bother.’” As these words were spoken at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o happened to overhear them.","• Narrative Context  
  – Marks a turning point: with Puali‘i’s death, both mother and son fall into want, underscoring human vulnerability even in chiefly lineages.  
  – Introduces ‘Ama‘u, ali‘i of O‘ahu at Waikīkī, establishing the next antagonist whose reputation and political power will challenge the young hero.  
  – The messenger from Honouliuli brings word of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s feats and fate, setting the stage for a direct confrontation.

• Names and Etymologies  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o (nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o): “the eyes of the pāo‘o fish.” Implies keen perception and vigilance—he will “see” and “hear” his destiny.  
  – Pōka‘ī (pō-ka‘ī): likely “night spouting,” a name tied to darkness and the ebb and flow of chiefly mana.  
  – ‘Ama‘u: name of a traditional hibiscus (māmaki) or “gallbladder,” symbolizing both the vessel of bitterness and the storage of vital juices—appropriate for a warlike ali‘i.

• Cultural and Historical Practice  
  – “Kiola ʻia kona poʻo i kai loa” (his head was cast far to sea) echoes the ritualized trophy-taking of enemies’ heads in the pre-contact ‘Ai Kapu era. Chiefs displayed such trophies to assert dominance and incite fear.  
  – The measure “‘elima mile” highlights the extraordinary nature of this act—a statement of ‘Ama‘u’s military reach and the boy’s tragic lineage.

• Allegorical and Thematic Analysis  
  – The paradox of small stature vs. immense strength is a common hero-initiation motif (cf. Maui, Kamapua‘a). It foreshadows Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s overcoming of physical limitations through god-given power.  
  – ‘Ama‘u’s conditional threat—“If he is strong, I will kill him; if not, I will not bother”—reveals a cultural valuation of mana (personal/spiritual power). To kill a weakling is dishonorable; to kill a powerful foe is a testament to one’s own status.  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s overhearing of the ali‘i’s words enacts the meaning of his name (maka = eye/seeing, listening), signaling that he is already entwined in the political struggle and that his path to heroism is divinely sanctioned.  
  – The episode dramatizes the tension between old order (represented by ‘Ama‘u’s warlike kapu practices) and the emerging hero who will challenge and reshape the sociopolitical landscape of O‘ahu.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p11,1,11,"A laila, lawe akula ia i kona makuahine e hūnā ma ke ana o Waipouli. A nalo ka makuahine, ho'i maila ia ā ko lākou hale ma Keahumoa, noho ihola.

After the mother had vanished, she returned to their house at Keahumoa and lived there continuously. Nāmakaokapāoʻo then climbed up onto the ridge of the house, loosened the bundles at his back and at his chest, and stretched out flat right in the very center of the ridgepole.","• Narrative Context and Actions  
  – “lawe akula ia i kona makuahine” (“he took his mother”) reflects a protective or strategic move, carrying her into the cave (anka) of Waipouli on Kauaʻi, a locale historically used as a refuge in times of threat.  
  – The mother’s disappearance and subsequent return to their dwelling at Keahumoa indicates restoration of normalcy. Keahumoa, meaning “heap of chickens,” situates the family within a named ahupuaʻa in Līhuʻe district.  

• Spatial Symbolism of the Hale  
  – Nāmakaokapāoʻo ascends to the kaupoku (ridgepole) of the hale, the high point and “piko” (navel) of a house, thought in Hawaiian architecture to connect interior life with the heavens above.  
  – By positioning himself at the very center of the ridge, he claims symbolic dominion over the ʻohana’s space, much as chiefs might occupy the piko of a heiau.  

• Gesture of Unbinding  
  – “wehe a‘ela i ka mau‘u o ke kua a me ke alo” (“loosened the bundles at his back and at his chest”) likely refers to untying kapa bundles or malo–pa‘ū bindings. In material culture, mau‘u (bundles of kapa) preserve mana and tapu; removing them can signal a release from ritual restriction.  
  – Allegorically, this act may represent Nāmakaokapāoʻo shedding inherited kapu constraints—an echo of post–ʻAi Kapu era shifts when Hawaiians began to question rigid protocols.  

• Name Etymology and Allegory  
  – Nāmaka-o-ka-pāoʻo literally “eyes of the pāoʻo fish,” here evoked by his perch atop the ridge—he becomes the “eyes” surveying all below. The pāoʻo is swift and watchful; so too Nāmakaokapāoʻo watches from the piko of the family domain.  
  – His exposure on the kaupoku places him between heaven and earth, an intermediary like a demigod. This aligns with earlier notes that his father, Kauluakahaʻi, is half-divine, underscoring the child’s own nexus between human and akua spheres.  

• Broader Cultural Resonances  
  – Cave-hiding (hūnā) and rooftop surveillance appear in other moʻolelo as tactics of refuge and assertion. The dual movement—concealment in Waipouli, then display on the kaupoku—mirrors rites of passage: withdrawal into the liminal, then emergence empowered.  
  – The narrative here foreshadows Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s growing prowess and challenge to established orders, just as in earlier paragraphs where he outstrips ʻAi Kapu norms by acting both destructively and autonomously.","Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

In each party were twenty-eight men—so it was for all four parties. When they reached the plain of Keahumoa, they entered the house—but there was no one there. As they were preparing to leave, Nāmakaokapāoʻo called out from the ridge. They heard the voice, though no body could be seen, and asked, “Where are you speaking from?” Nāmakaokapāoʻo replied, “Here I am, up above.” Eight men climbed up—four on the back of the house and four on the front—and there they found Nāmakaokapāoʻo. He asked them, “What is the purpose of your coming?” They answered, “We have come to wage war against Nāmakaokapāoʻo—a mere child like you, small though you are, yet so strong and so brave, you who slew your own father, Pualiʻi.”","• Narrative context: This paragraph introduces the first direct military challenge against Nāmakaokapāoʻo. A rival chief, ʻAmaʻu of Waikīkī, dispatches a sizeable force to capture or slay the boy-hero, setting the stage for a confrontation that reveals Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s uncanny powers and his growing reputation.

• ʻAmaʻu (perhaps “the black fern moth,” or a personal name of obscure etymology) is portrayed as a war-leader (aliʻi) mobilizing four separate koa units (poʻe kaua).  
  – “He kanalā kumamāwalu” (28) men per unit recalls calendrical and martial symbolism: 28 days of the lunar month, a full cycle of time marshaled for battle. Four such units total 112 warriors.  

• Keahumoa (“the lofty plain”) functions as a strategic locale, a clearing where houses (hale) stand alone—ideal for ambushes and displays of prowess.  

• The empty house implies Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s stealth or supernatural vigilance. As the invaders prepare to retreat, his disembodied voice echoes from the rooftop (kaupoku), a trope of divine or semi-divine figures who transcend normal visibility.  
  – His name, Nāmaka-o-ka-pāoʻo, “the eyes of the pāoʻo fish” (pāoʻo here a poetic echo of poʻo, “head”), signals that though small he perceives all—and his reputation (“eyes”) extends beyond his visible form.  

• The eight warriors’ approach—four climbing from the back (kua), four from the front (alo)—reflects traditional tactics of encirclement and the kapu protocols of war: no one should escape the sight of the invader.  

• The formal exchange—Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s inquiry “He aha mai nei kā ʻoukou ʻana?” (“What brings you here?”)—echoes the ritualized speech of aliʻi encountering foes. It inverts the guest-host relationship: here, Nāmakaokapāoʻo is the host to his own body.  

• The warriors’ reply invokes the paradox of the “keiki ʻuʻuku” (small child) whose strength and courage surpass that of seasoned fighters. They cite his slaying of Pualiʻi (his father), an act of patricide that both curses and consecrates him, marking him as a being who upends the natural and social order.  
  – In Hawaiian moʻolelo, the killing of one’s father often signals the overthrow of an old kapu system and the ushering in of a new order. Nāmakaokapāoʻo thus stands at the threshold of transformative power, embodying both youthful promise and divine retribution.","Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, ""Where is that voice coming from?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I'm up here."" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""What in the world are you all doing here?"" They said, ""We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.""","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

They replied: “No—it is you indeed, as we have heard. Therefore you will slay us, and you shall not live.”  
Nāmakaokapāoʻo answered: “Come on, let us go down below and fight.”  
When they descended to the lowlands, Nāmakaokapāoʻo struck at them, and they all fell dead—only one man remained. That man fled until he reached ʻAmaʻu at Waikīkī, and he told him of their complete destruction, with only ʻAmaʻu left to hear the tale.","• Narrative Context (Chapter 1, Paragraph 13):  
  – At this point in the narrative, the hero has already demonstrated supernatural strength. Here he formally reveals his identity and confronts a group of opponents who have been pursuing or opposing him in the uplands of Koʻolau.  
  – The descent from the mountain to the lowlands (‘i lalo’) marks a decisive shift: the hero brings the battle to the enemy’s own terrain, sealing his victory.  

• Characters & Name Etymologies:  
  – Nāmaka-o-ka-pāoʻo (“the eyes of the pāoʻo fish”): evokes keen vision and predatory force; his declaration of name asserts his mana and authority in the custom of genealogical and identity assertion common in Hawaiian oratory.  
  – The Unnamed Opponents: Their admission—“we have heard”—reveals the power of oral reputation in the ‘Ai Kapu era, when tales of chiefs and heroes preceded them and could instill fear.  
  – ʻAmaʻu (“ferny place” or “the fern”): as the sole survivor and messenger, his name suggests renewal and the spreading of news, much like the ʻamaʻu fern that colonizes new ground after a clearing.  

• Cultural Practices & Motifs:  
  – Challenge & Reply: The back-and-forth dialogue (“No—you are the one… you will not live”) follows the pattern of ritualized confrontation before a battle, reflecting protocols of respect, name-calling, and the testing of courage.  
  – Choice of Battleground: Hawaiian warfare valued strategic terrain. By luring his foes downhill, Nāmakaokapāoʻo demonstrates not only brute force but tactical acumen—a hallmark of an aliʻi warrior.  
  – The Lone Messenger: The motif of a single escapee (“ka i holo”) ensures the hero’s deeds enter collective memory. In traditional society, such messengers preserved genealogies and exploits, vital for maintaining a chief’s legacy.  

• Allegorical Interpretations:  
  – Victory of a Singular Divine Force: The hero’s slaughter of many symbolizes the triumph of higher spiritual order (akua or demi-god intervention) over chaotic or rebellious elements.  
  – Survival & Renewal: The lone survivor, ʻAmaʻu, embodies the idea that from destruction there comes regrowth—paralleling social renewal under a rightful ruler, or the way communities rebuild after upheaval.  

• Linguistic & Poetic Features:  
  – Repetition & Emphasis: Phrases like “no laila… e make ana ‘oe iā mākou” use emphatic particles to heighten drama.  
  – Direct Speech: Maintains the immediacy of oral tradition; dialogue tags (‘Ī aku… ‘Ī mai…) mark speaker changes clearly, a feature of Hawaiian narrative style.","Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him."" The soldiers said, ""No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive."" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""Well, let's go down and fight."" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

Nāmakaokapāo‘o then surrounded all of O‘ahu, and afterwards he climbed up to his mother and had himself firmly installed over the land of O‘ahu.","Paragraph 14 marks the culmination of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s early campaigns as he defeats the war chief ‘Ama‘u, conquers the entire island of O‘ahu, and establishes his rule via his maternal line.

• Introduction of ‘Ama‘u  
  – Name etymology: “‘Ama‘u” may invoke the image of the land snail (“‘ama‘u”), suggesting a persistent, creeping force. The root “‘ama” (to cover, to soil) could also imply one who claims or covers the land.  
  – As a rival chief, he embodies the old order that must be overturned by the young hero.

• Mobilization of War Canoes (wa‘a kaua)  
  – ho‘omākaukau ihola ia i kona mau wa‘a kaua he ‘umi kumamāwalu: “he completely prepared eighteen war canoes.”  
  – The use of “ihola” (“completely”) both here and later in describing ‘Ama‘u’s destruction creates a poetic parallel.  
  – Eighteen canoes may carry symbolic weight, perhaps alluding to genealogical lines or the full muster of a chief’s martial resources in the ‘Ai Kapu era.

• Geographic and Strategic Setting: ‘Ewa  
  – “holo akula i lalo o ‘Ewa”: sailing down from the highlands of ‘Ewa, the southwestern district of O‘ahu, historically a power center under the Ewa ali‘i.  
  – By attacking in this region, ‘Ama‘u directly challenges Nāmakaokapāo‘o on his home turf.

• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s Counterattack (noke mai)  
  – “e noke mai ana ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o”: “Nāmakaokapāo‘o charges down,” using noke, a verb of sudden, headlong movement—like a storm or predator.  
  – “luku ā pau loa” and “‘a‘ohe kanaka koe”: “utter annihilation” and “not a single person remains,” employing pau loa to stress totality, a concept familiar in ritual destruction and renewal.

• Destruction of ‘Ama‘u  
  – “a make ihola ‘o ‘Ama‘u”: “‘Ama‘u was completely slain.” The echo of ihola underlines the thoroughness of his downfall.  
  – Allegorically, the hero’s slaying of ‘Ama‘u represents the overthrow of entrenched powers and the righting of genealogical imbalance.

• Conquest and Envelopment of O‘ahu (puni a‘ela)  
  – “Puni a‘ela ‘o O‘ahu nei iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o”: “O‘ahu was wholly encircled and seized by Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” This formulaic phrase is often found in war chants to denote absolute subjugation.  
  – Conquest through puni evokes both military encirclement and the ritual surround-and-cleanse practices of the ‘Ai Kapu heiau.

• Installation via the Maternal Line  
  – “ki‘i akula ia i kona makuahine”: “he climbed up to his mother.” In Hawaiian chiefly praxis, the mother’s rank is as important as the father’s; maternal endorsement confers sacred legitimacy.  
  – “ho‘onoho ihola i luna o ka ‘āina O‘ahu nei”: “he had himself firmly installed over the land of O‘ahu.” The repeated ihola underscores that his installation is as absolute as his victory.

• Allegorical and Cultural Interpretation  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s triumph allegorizes the consolidation of ali‘i power and the emergence of a centralized rulership from the chaos of inter-chief warfare.  
  – His ascent via Pōka‘ī, the mother, reaffirms the balance of male martial prowess and female genealogical authority central to pre-contact Hawaiian governance.","When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
