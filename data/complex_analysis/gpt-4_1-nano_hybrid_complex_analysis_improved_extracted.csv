His father is Kauluakaha‘i, from Kahikipapaialewa, an area in Kahikinu‘u. His mother is Pōka‘ī. His father is a high chief from Kahikipapaialewa, and his mother is of divine lineage.","• Allegorical significance of the child Nāmakaokapāo‘o:
  – Represents a legendary or mythic hero embodying both youthfulness and formidable strength, possibly serving as a cultural symbol of resilience or divine claim.
  – His lack of rivals “ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau” suggests a domain or sovereignty extending across the Hawaiian archipelago, indicating a figure of widespread influence or spiritual authority.

• Name analysis of Nāmakaokapāo‘o:
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o can be broken down as “Nā-maka” (eyes or faces), “o-ka” (of the), and “pāo‘o” (possibly from pā‘o‘o, meaning to cut or to initiate). 
  – Could symbolize “the faces/eyes of Pā‘o‘o” or “the divine eye of Pā‘o‘o,” hinting at awareness, insight, or divine observation, aligning with her mythic status.
  – Alternatively, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o may reference a guardian or perceptive deity, emphasizing spiritual insight or sovereignty.

• Cultural symbolism of ‘u‘uku loa (very small) and koa loa (very brave/warrior-like):
  – Reflects traditional Hawaiian ideals valorized in youth: strength and bravery, but also humility in being “‘u‘uku” (small)—a recurring motif emphasizing that true greatness need not be physical size.
  – Reinforces the cultural value of spiritual and moral strength over mere physical attributes.

• Parentage and regional ties:
  – Kauluakaha‘i from Kahikipapaialewa, linked to Kahikinu‘u, sites that are historically significant and symbolic, perhaps representing specific mana-rich regions or chiefly lines.
  – The mention of a high chief father “no Kahikipapaialewa” and “he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona,” indicating divine or semi-divine lineage—common in Hawaiian aristocratic genealogies—integrating spiritual authority with temporal rule.
  – The maternal figure Pōka‘ī, suggests another noble or divine lineage, as “Pō” (night) and “ka‘ī” (to bind) often carry spiritual or ancestral significance.

• Historical/cultural context:
  – The narrative emphasizes chiefly and divine lineage, typical of genealogies (“ mo‘okū‘auhau”) that legitimize authority and mana.
  – Its content reflects the pre-contact or early contact era where legends served to reinforce social hierarchies and spiritual authority.
  – Possible comment on social stratification, divine right, and ancestral heroism, especially from the Ai Kapu era up to the abolition of kapu and the influence of Christian missionaries (early 19th century).

• Broader symbolic themes:
  – The lineage and divine attributes suggest a narrative that underscores the importance of genealogy, divine ancestry, and leadership.
  – The mention of “‘ohe ona lua” (no rival) may symbolize ultimate sovereignty, perhaps critiquing or affirming the divine right of certain chiefly lines, or reflecting the social aspiration to divine order.
  – The blend of mythic elements and regional references points to a worldview where divine authority and land are intertwined, advocating for reverence of the ancestors and land.

• Overall, this passage functions both as an ancestral genealogy and as a mythic allegory emphasizing divine origins, divine justice, and heroic qualities, serving to legitimize chiefly authority and cultural values rooted in spiritual symbolism and genealogical memory.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","Chapter 1 of this Hawaiian narrative explores themes of divine lineage, heroism, courage, and the supernatural within a richly layered cultural and historical context. Central to the story is Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a small but extraordinarily brave child born into noble and divine parentage—his father a high chief and his mother of divine descent. Despite his modest beginnings and physical fragility, Nāmakaokapāo‘o possesses remarkable strength and resilience, embodying the Hawaiian ideals of mana (spiritual power) and heroism.

The chapter underscores the importance of genealogy and divine connections, establishing Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s legitimacy and exceptional qualities through references to divine ancestors and chiefly lineage. His upbringing is marked by notions of impoverishment and hardship, yet he displays natural prowess and bravery, engaging in pivotal events that highlight his strength and the supernatural realm.

Hawaiian cultural values are vividly illustrated through episodes involving fishing, taro farming—sacred staples—and rituals that affirm communal bonds and the spiritual significance of land and resource management. The interactions with Puali‘i, a noble but jealous figure, reveal themes of conflict, threat, and the potential for violence, culminating in Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s confrontation with him. His prayers and martial prowess demonstrate a spiritual connection to ancient Hawaiian beliefs, emphasizing prayer and spiritual protection even in moments of peril.

The narrative also details conflicts with external chiefs, like ‘Ama‘u of Waikīkī, highlighting themes of bravery, warfare, and territorial sovereignty. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s heroism culminates in the death of ‘Ama‘u and the assertion of his authority over O‘ahu, marking him as a legendary figure who embodies the warrior spirit of Hawai‘i.

Culturally, the chapter reflects a Polynesian world where ancestors, divine lineage, land, and natural elements are intertwined with the hero's life story. It emphasizes the significance of genealogy, divine right, ritual, and martial valor in Hawaiian society.

In terms of literary importance, this chapter functions as a foundational myth that immortalizes Nāmakaokapāo‘o in Hawaiian oral tradition. It integrates moral lessons, ancestral worship, and the valorization of courage and strength, shaping Hawaiian identity and cultural memory. Its vivid storytelling, rich symbolism, and themes of divine authority contribute to the cultural fabric that sustains Hawaiian historical consciousness.

Overall, this chapter encapsulates a narrative of heroism rooted in divine ancestry, illustrating the enduring values of strength, bravery, spiritual connection, and rightful sovereignty that are central to Hawaiian cultural and literary heritage."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Pōka‘ī lifted Nāmakaokapāoʻo, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land. Pōka‘ī sat with his child, and later, a birth occurred. From this birth, both Pōka‘ī and his child Nāmakaokapāoʻo were very impoverished.","• Allegorical Reading of Characters and Events
  – The passage depicts a mythic origin scene involving divine or semi-divine figures linking to the land and ancestors.
  – Hō‘ae‘ae, as the land in ‘Ewa, functions both as a geographic place and a symbolic cradle of kinship and divine lineage.
  – The union (""launa kino"") suggests a sacred or foundational relationship, emphasizing the integral connection between land (Hō‘ae‘ae) and ancestral power.

• Symbolism of Name and Characters
  – Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s name stems from 'Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo', meaning ""the eyes of the pāoʻo"" (possibly metaphorical for vigilance or divine oversight). The ‘pāoʻo’ bird or element may symbolize spiritual or ancestral watchfulness.
  – Pōka‘ī, likely representing a figure of nobility or higher status, signifies an ancestral or chiefly authority, as ""Pō"" often connotes darkness or sacredness, and ""ka‘i"" can imply lifting or elevation.
  – Kauluakaha‘i, with ""ka ulu"" meaning ""the head"" and “akaha‘i” possibly linked to cleared or open space, might symbolize a return to or a connection with land or origins.

• Cultural and Historical Context
  – The narrative appears rooted in oral traditions recounting divine genealogies, possibly from the Ai Kapu era, emphasizing genealogy, land, and divine authority (though the story shows signs of post-contact influence with the mention of impoverishment and struggle).
  – The mention of impoverishment (""ilihune loa"") after the birth reflects a recurring theme in Hawaiian storytelling—links between divine origin stories and the hardships faced by descendants, possibly alluding to the disrupted social order following contact and western influence.
  – The scene’s imagery of land and progeny echoes traditional Hawaiian concepts of *‘ohana* (family) and *‘āina* (land as mother/father), illustrating foundational myths about the origins of chiefly lines and land tenure.

• Possible Social or Cultural Critique
  – The narrative might subtly critique the fate of noble or divine lines, highlighting how, despite divine origins, descendants often faced hardship—an allegory for the diminishing of traditional authority post-1820s, during the Missionary period, and the social upheavals thereafter.
  – The emphasis on poverty (""ilihune loa"") in the aftermath of divine birth could symbolize the spiritual and material loss experienced during colonial contact, land dispossession, or cultural erosion.

• Overall, the passage encapsulates Hawaiian mythic themes of divine genealogy, land connection, and the intertwining of spiritual authority with earthly struggles, reflecting both reverence for ancestors and awareness of historical disruptions.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p3,1,3,"Iā lāua e noho ana, iho maila ‘o Puali‘i, he  kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e, i ka lawai‘a ma kai o  Honouliuli, kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka‘ī.

Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and desired her, and he said: ""I want you to be my wife."" Pōka‘ī replied: ""How can you want me? I have borne a child, and my body is hurt."" Puali‘i said: ""Those are nothing matters; since you wish me, let us sleep together."" Pōka‘ī agreed. Then Pōka‘ī and her husband, along with Puali‘i, sat down at Keahumoa's school (or place).","• Allegorical theme of desire and social conflict:  
  – The narrative depicts a person from Līhu‘e (connected with a well-regarded district of Kaua‘i) visiting Pōka‘ī, indicating a common story motif where outsiders bring challenges or desires that test social bonds.  
  – Puali‘i’s desire for Pōka‘ī signifies external influences or temptations entering traditional Hawaiian social structures.

• Cultural symbolism in personal relationships:
  – Pōka‘ī’s refusal to accept Puali‘i’s advances because she bears a child and is injured suggests an allegory for wounded status or loss of mana (spiritual authority and social standing), possibly reflecting the societal upheaval from earlier periods such as the Ai Kapu era or after the 1819 abolition of the kapu system.  
  – Her willingness to finally sleep with Puali‘i upon his insistence can symbolize societal pressures or the abdication of traditional taboos.

• Names and their meanings:  
  – Puali‘i (from ""pua-lī‘i"" potentially meaning ""flower of honor"" or ""flower of rank"") may symbolize noble or high-ranking individuals whose desires threaten social harmony.  
  – Pōka‘ī (from “pō” = night, darkness; “ka‘ī” = My own or perhaps ‘the chief’) could represent a traditional figure, possibly a woman of standing or a symbol of the native social order.  
  – Keahumoa (name derived from “kea” = white, “humoa” = to knead or to press) — possibly a place associated with learning (literally “the white kneading” or “pressing place”), hinting at education or transformation.

• The setting at ""Keahumoa"" and reference to ""kula"" (field) and ""hālau"" (school) bears significance:
  – It connects the narrative to traditional social and educational institutions.  
  – The mention of sitting at Keahumoa’s school could symbolize a site of cultural transmission or social negotiation, especially post-1820 when missionary influence was beginning to reshape Hawaiian education.

• Historical context and social commentary:
  – The narrative subtly reflects the social dynamics during the decline of the kapu system and the increasing influence of Western contact and Christianity.  
  – Pōka‘ī’s injury and bearing a child may symbolize the societal disruptions and the loss of sacred law, while the interaction among these characters mirrors tensions between traditional authority and new social realities.

• Overall symbolic message:
  – The story may serve as an allegory of the transition from traditional Hawaiian societal norms towards a transformed social order, with characters embodying old values, new influences, and the conflicts therein.
  – It hints at how personal relationships and societal structures were impacted by external forces, foreshadowing Polynesian adaptation to changing religious and cultural influences post-1820.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

As for the ‘uala, Puali‘i spoke his oath, “Where the head of the ulua (giant trevally) is buried with the ‘uala, I and my wife Pōka‘ī will eat from it, and afterwards, she, Pōka‘ī, and others may eat.” Therefore, Puali‘i went to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for i‘a (fish) along with ‘uala (taro).","• Allegorical symbolism of the land, fishing, and crops
  – The fields (‘māla) and ‘uala symbolize sustenance, fertility, and a connection to land and water resources typical of traditional Hawaiian subsistence practices. 
  – ‘Nāmakaokapāo‘o’ as a place name may evoke a sacred or ancestral domain, anchoring the narrative in specific sacred geography connected to kānaka (people) livelihood and spiritual identity.

• The character Puali‘i and oath symbolism
  – ‘Puali‘i’—the prefix ‘Pu-’ often denotes foundation or origin, while ‘-li‘i’ suggests growth or increasing; his name may symbolize a foundational leader or someone linked to growth and authority.
  – His oath about the ulua’s head buried with the ‘uala’ possibly signifies a ritual or spiritual condition, emphasizing the importance of place-based mo‘olelo (stories) and kōʻā (promises) grounded in sacred geography and genealogy.

• The significance of the ulua and ‘uala
  – The ulua (giant trevally) often symbolizes strength, leadership, and abundance in Hawaiian lore.
  – The act of burying the ulua’s head with the ‘uala’ may be an allegory for balancing the strength (ulua) and sustenance (taro), reflecting an ideal harmony between power and sustenance.

• Reference to Honouliuli and traditional fishing practices
  – Honouliuli, a known coastal area, connects the story to established fishing and gathering sites, emphasizing the importance of specific locations for resource acquisition.
  – Fishing for i‘a and gathering ‘uala are fundamental Hawaiian activities, signifying self-sufficiency and connection to natural cycles.

• Broader historical context
  – The story, with its emphasis on land, fishing, and oath-taking, reflects traditional pre-contact Hawaiian society, where resource management, sacred sites, and genealogical ties were constitutional.
  – The narrative context suggests a time before the profound disruptions of the ‘Ai Kapu’ era or the 1819 abandonment, before heavy European influence, where oral traditions reinforced social order and spiritual values.
  – The emphasis on ritualized promises and land boundaries indicates societal norms rooted in mālama (‘to care for’), lokomaika‘i (‘generosity’), and respect for sacred geography.

• Cultural and social commentary
  – The oath about the ulua’s head may also serve as a metaphor for social contracts—promises that bind individuals and their families to land, resource stewardship, and spiritual obligations.
  – The story subtly underscores the importance of honoring connections to ‘āina (land) and kai (sea), themes central to Hawaiian cultural resilience and identity.
  
• Overall significance
  – This passage encapsulates the symbiotic relationship between land, water, and community, emphasizing respect for natural and spiritual resources.
  – It also subtly hints at the continuity of leadership, tradition, and the sacredness of place, which would have been challenged during the post-contact period and colonization efforts, yet remains foundational to Hawaiian worldview.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s body then was very thin, with two large patches of skin on her sides, and even though she was sick, she still leaned back lazily. When they reached the taro patch, she called to the children, “Pull down the remote stalks with the entire taro leaves on top, without leaving any to grow.” But, because the child was afraid, he quietly held back, and did not pull down the stalks, leaving them standing.","• Allegorical interpretation of characters:
  – Puali‘i, often associated with royal authority or a noble line, is presented here in relation to sustenance—‘a breadfruit’—symbolizing abundance or a noble source of life or nourishment.
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a name meaning “the eye or eye of the ocean,” references divine or ancestral forces connected to the sea, which historically represented both danger and sustenance.
  – The children (ten or seven) represent the next generation or community members entrusted with natural or spiritual responsibilities.

• Cultural symbolism:
  – The breadfruit (‘hala’) is a staple food, symbolizing sustenance, prosperity, and perhaps divine provision—also, it links to the ‘Ai Kapu era, representing traditional sustenance practices and sacred food gathering before the 1819 abandonment.
  – The taro (‘kālua’) symbolizes fertility, land stewardship, and ancestral connection, central to Hawaiian life and cosmology.
  – The act of “huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala”—pulling down the taro stalks with leaves—can be read as a metaphor for harvesting or respecting the natural cycle, emphasizing care and restraint, echoing cultural principles of sustainability.

• Significance of the narrative detail:
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s physical state (“very thin”) and her laziness or relaxed attitude may symbolize the blended state of spiritual authority and human frailty—indicating that even divine or ancestral forces are bound to the natural order.
  – The child's fear and reluctance to pull the stalks can symbolize societal or generational hesitance to fully engage with or respect sacred or traditional practices.
  – The instruction to harvest “without leaving any to grow” echoes cultural values of abundance and maximizing resources, while also hinting at spiritual or moral lessons about responsibility and restraint.

• Names and their etymology:
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo’o: “Eye of the ocean,” signifying divine sight or insight—possibly representing a divine figure or a metaphor for ancestral wisdom.
  – Puali‘i (literally “Great Flower” or “Supreme Flower”): implying nobility, vitality, or a royal lineage.
  – The numbers seven and ten (ke ‘umi kumamāhiku): often symbolize perfection, completeness, or sacredness in Hawaiian cosmology.

• Historical and cultural context:
  – The narrative possibly alludes to the pre-contact and early post-contact periods, highlighting traditional practices of food gathering and resource management.
  – The relaxed attitude of Nāmakaokapāo‘o and the caution of the child might reflect societal shifts—possibly hinting at the decline of traditional values during the period of societal upheaval following the 1819 abandonment of the kapu system and the influence of Westerners and missionaries after 1820.
  – The emphasis on cautious harvest and leaving nothing to grow may critique modern tendencies toward overexploitation or a loss of reverence for natural resources—a social commentary stemming from historical changes.

• Broader thematic insights:
  – The passage encapsulates core Hawaiian values of mālama (care), respect for nature, and reverence for ancestors.
  – It subtly critiques societal tendencies to neglect or exploit sacred resources, reinforcing the importance of restraint and moderation rooted in traditional practice.
  – The allegory also emphasizes the connection between spiritual authority (represented by Nāmakaokapāo‘o) and responsible resource management, serving as a moral lesson embedded within a cultural narrative.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then, Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned and set fire, pouring four bundles of oil onto the steaming taro corms on the kalua pit. While she was pouring the oil onto the fire, her mother, Kāʻiliki, arrived and asked her, “ʻAʻole (No).” Puali‘i responded: “Yes, it is the head and eyes that determine the fate of my taro today, which is why this is the day I will die.”","• Allegorical interpretation of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s actions:
  – The character represents a disruptive, perhaps destructive force, possibly embodying natural or social upheaval.
  – Her destruction of the taro patches signifies an act of reaping or eradicating established sustenance, perhaps reflecting societal disruptions during a period of upheaval or change.
  – The repeated destruction and the size of the leaves—“about six and a half” — may symbolize cycles or numerological significance, hinting at an ongoing or perpetual conflict.

• Cultural symbolism of the taro patches (‘uala) and their destruction:
  – Taro (kalo) is central to Hawaiian sustenance and spiritual life; its destruction symbolizes loss, upheaval, or the desecration of traditional stability.
  – The act of setting fire and pouring oil contrasts traditional reverence with destructive acts, possibly reflecting post-contact tensions where sacred practices were challenged or co-opted.
  – The “two patches” combined into one suggests unity or a significant transformation—perhaps the blending, conflict, or loss of traditional social units.

• Names and their meanings:
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o: “The eyes of Pāo'o” or “The gaze of Pāo'o,” possibly referring to a divine or watchful aspect tasked with overseeing or judging.
  – Pōka‘ī: “The darkness of the night,” symbolizing mystery, death, or transition, hinting at spiritual or inevitable change.
  – Puali‘i: “A great chief or ruler,” indicating authority, but here perhaps a symbolic stand-in for fate or destiny, emphasizing the importance of hierarchy and spiritual balance.
  – Kāʻiliki: The mother figure, possibly representing cultural memory, tradition, or ancestral power, intervening at a moment of crisis.

• Cultural and historical context:
  – The narrative resembles motifs from the Ai Kapu era (pre-1819 Hawaiʻi), where sacred practices and social order were central.
  – The mention of setting fire and possibly sacrificial language echoes the upheaval of the traditional kapu system, leading up to the 1819 abandonment of the kapu.
  – The dialogue about death and fate could mirror societal anxieties during the post-contact period, where traditional ways were challenged by external influences such as missionaries and colonial pressures (post-1820 influence).

• Possible social commentary:
  – The story encapsulates themes of destruction and the inevitability of change, perhaps critiquing or reflecting on the loss of traditional authority.
  – The dialogue about “the head and eyes” determining death may symbolize how leadership or spiritual insight guides or forewarns of societal transformation.
  – The involvement of maternal authority (Kāʻiliki) suggests the importance of ancestral or divine guidance in navigating upheaval, hinting at concerns about losing cultural identity during times of crisis.

• Overall, the passage uses mythic figures and natural symbolism to encode debates over social order, spiritual balance, and cultural survival amid historical upheaval, illustrating the tension between preservation and destruction inherent in Hawaiʻi’s transitional periods.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

Seeing all the children, they all ran, and they stood on a little hill out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i then spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: ""'Look! Here is the ko‘ilipi (knife) in my hand, it is a thing for cutting your head today, and behead, then cook with the ‘uala, and I will eat first, then it will be free (to do as I please)."" But Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not listen to Puali‘i’s words, and Puali‘i then prepared to cut Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the ko‘ilipi, at that moment when Nāmakaokapāo‘i was praying his last prayers for Puali‘i. Those were his prayers: ""Aloha (love/affection) only is my gaze, O eaves (no‘a) of the kea (possibly a metaphor), May it scatter, may it break apart, perhaps to eat, perhaps to leave behind—Nākukui‘aimakaokalani (the bright-eyed sky-gazing Kuki ‘aimakaokalani), that is Kukui‘aimakaokalani, my friend, Nāmakaokai‘a the great chief of Hawai‘i. Let it drift away, let the streaks of the one-hardened, the spear, the drum, die Nāmakaokapāo‘o.""","• Allegorical interpretation of characters and events:
  – Puali‘i, as a figure of authority or perhaps a rogue noble, represents a threat to the community’s safety; his act of wielding a ko‘ilipi (knife) signifies violence or a dangerous test of power. The imagery of him throwing 'akula (like a spear or throwing motion) suggests aggressive intent.
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o, whose name means ""Sea-Dwellers (Nāmaka) of the chiefs (pāo'o),"" symbolizes a venerable and possibly sacred figure—perhaps a chief, guardian, or personification of spiritual or societal authority. His kneeling and prayerful stance reflect humility and spiritual focus in the face of danger.
  – The children’s flight signifies innocence and vulnerability, emphasizing the peril faced from the wielding of raw power or violence.

• Names and symbolic references:
  – Puali‘i: ""Puali‘i"" can be broken into ""Pu-ali‘i"" (“ruler’s gun/authority”), indicating a person with noble or commanding status, possibly corrupted or aggressive.
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o: ""Nāmaka"" means ""sea (Nā) of (o) the full (maka) eyes or gaze,"" indicating a divine or oceanic intelligence; ""pāo'o"" often refers to a chief or principal figure, suggesting high rank or spiritual authority.
  – The phrase ""Nākukui‘aimakaokalani"" (""the clouds (kuki) with eyes (‘aimaka) of the sky (lani)"") evokes celestial observation, perhaps symbolizing wisdom or divine oversight.

• Cultural and historical context:
  – The narrative likely echoes the Ai Kapu era (before 1819), a time of strict religious and social codes, where violence or threats to sacred authority would be critically condemned.
  – The act of prayer and invocation of divine or ancestral protection aligns with traditional Hawaiian spiritual practices, especially during times of social upheaval or threat.
  – The story's tension, involving threat and prayer, could reflect post-contact social commentaries—a critique of destructive behaviors or overreach of power, especially as Hawaiian society faced external influences after 1820 (e.g., missionaries, Western powers).

• Symbolism and deeper themes:
  – The “ko‘ilipi” (knife) within the story symbolizes not only physical violence but also the potential rupture of social harmony or kapu (sacred laws).
  – The final prayer, with references to love, scattering, and leaving behind, suggests a plea for mercy or spiritual grace amid impending destruction—possibly an allegory for societal or spiritual decay.
  – The mention of specific natural elements (the sea, clouds, the sky) emphasizes interconnectedness with nature, reflective of traditional Hawaiian worldview where natural elements are spiritual agents.

• Possible social commentary or critique:
  – The narrative may be a subtle critique of those in authority who threaten or pursue their own interests at the expense of community harmony, illustrating the peril of neglecting spiritual guidance.
  – The plea for mercy and the imagery of death and scattering could symbolize the loss of traditional values or the chaos that ensues when social order is disturbed—especially relevant during periods of colonization or societal upheaval.
  – The text’s layered symbolism encourages reflection on the importance of spiritual humility, community cohesion, and respect for sacred authority, themes central to Hawaiian cultural resilience.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Here, I will briefly speak about those two names, which are Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a; they are chiefly figures of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani is a male parent of Nāmakaokai‘a, and he is a child of Nāmakaokai‘a; but he has entered into the prayer (or petition) of Nāmakaapāo‘o.","• **Identification of Names and Characters as Cultural Symbols**
  – The names Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a are likely representations of ancestral allegories, possibly embodying divine or chiefly forces associated with water, the sea, or territorial sovereignty; “Nāmaka” itself references a sea goddess (or deity) in Hawaiian myth, implying deep connections to natural and spiritual authority.
  – The designation of these figures as 'ali‘i nui' (great chiefs) indicates their high social or sacred status, which may echo real or mythic lineages—perhaps even symbolizing different aspects of Hawaiian sovereignty or natural elements.
  
• **Names Etymology and Symbolism**
  – Nāmaka-okalani: “Nā-maka” (the gaze or face) and “-okalani” (the heavens or sky) suggests a divine or celestial aspect, possibly representing the sky or overarching authority.
  – Nāmakaokai‘a: “Nāmaka” again (sea or goddess), with “-okai‘a” (the reef or fishtrap), implying a connection to the sea’s bounty, fertility, or perhaps a localized domain or domain-specific divine force.
  – The genealogical relationship (“Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a”) echoes the Hawaiian emphasis on genealogy as a reflection of divine origin, linking natural elements directly to familial ties.

• **Allegorical Interpretation of Characters and Passage**
  – The passage may symbolize the transfer or sharing of divine authority or natural power—Nāmakaokalani (the sky) as a male ancestor parent, and Nāmakaokai‘a (the reef or sea domain) as progeny—highlighting the interconnectedness of sky, sea, and land.
  – The mention that Nāmakaokalani “kama i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaapāo‘o” (“entered into the prayer of Nāmakaapāo‘o”) could symbolize the invocation or acknowledgment of divine powers during rituals, emphasizing the sacred, hierarchical transmission of authority.
  – It may also subtly critique the social or spiritual authority, illustrating its rootedness within traditional prayer and special rituals, possibly in contrast to post-contact societal disruptions.

• **Historical and Cultural Context**
  – The reference reflects pre-contact Hawaiian societal structure—chiefless or chiefly rituals often involved genealogical ties and invocation of divine ancestors (see Beckwith, 1951).
  – The emphasis on prayer (“pule”) signifies the importance of religious practice in legitimizing social hierarchies and connecting the human and divine realms.
  – Considering the broader narrative, this segment may be situated during a period where traditional genealogies and divine relationships were foundational—just before or during the Ai Kapu era, maintaining sacred taboos and revered ancestral ties.
  – The mention of entering into prayers could foreshadow shifts post-1820s when Western influences and Christian missionaries began to undermine traditional spiritual practices (“kūpaʻa” or suppression), hinting at a shift from divine authority rooted in tradition to new religious paradigms.

• **Cultural Significance and Possible Social Commentary**
  – Intertwining genealogies with divine invocation might serve as a subtle reminder of the sacred origins of ali‘i and Hawaiian sovereignty, potentially critiquing or highlighting the importance of maintaining spiritual legitimacy.
  – Alternatively, it may indirectly comment on the fragility of traditional custodianship—by tracing divine parentage and invoking prayers, the narrative underscores the sacred foundation of Hawaiian social order, which was challenged through colonization and missionary influence.

Overall, this passage weaves complex allegories of divine genealogy, ritual importance, and the interconnectedness of natural and spiritual authority, reflecting traditional Hawaiian worldview principles amid the societal transformations brought by contact and change.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p9,1,9,"A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o, i ia wā i  ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o, e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i  iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē.

Puali‘i, of the same land (or district), then spoke a word. The chief of Puali‘i responded to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Greetings to you, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o then slapped Puali‘i’s head and threw him into the sea at Waipouli, in a hollow on the shore of Honouliuli, a distance of five miles.","• Allegorical interpretation of the scene:
  – The act of Puali‘i removing the ko‘ilipi (tripod) perhaps symbolizes disrupting sacred or authoritative objects—possibly a challenge to divine or chiefly order.
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s recitation of a prayer signifies a time of spiritual or ritual significance, implying that the confrontation occurs within a sacred context.
  – The violence—Nāmakaokapāo‘o striking Puali‘i and casting him into the sea—may symbolize the assertion of spiritual or social boundaries, enforcing traditional taboos and hierarchy.

• Character names and symbolism:
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o:
    – ‘Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’ can be broken down as “the eyes (maka) of Pāo‘o,” where ‘Pāo‘o’ might be interpreted as a figure of perspective or domain.
    – As the goddess of the ocean and water, Nāmaka is often a symbol of powerful natural forces—particularly the sea’s capacity for both nurturing and destructive action.
  – Puali‘i:
    – ‘Puali‘i’ may derive from 'pua' (flower, young) and 'li‘i' (small, young), possibly indicating a youthful or lesser chief, perhaps representing lower social ranks or challengers to authority.

• Cultural and historical context:
  – The narrative likely reflects the traditional Hawaiian worldview emphasizing kapu (taboos) and order, where sacred objects and authority are protected through ritual and, when violated, through punishment.
  – The scene’s geographic references—Waipouli and Honouliuli—are areas in Hawai‘i associated with specific chiefly lineages and cultural sites, anchoring the story in local geography with cultural significance.
  – The mention of a distance of five miles (‘o kona loa, ‘elima mile ka loa):
    – Numeric symbolism in Hawaiian narratives often carries deeper meanings; five can denote balance or a certain spiritual completion, perhaps emphasizing the significance of the act or location.

• Reflection on social commentary:
  – The story may serve as a metaphor for societal boundaries and the consequences of disrespecting sacred authority.
  – The act of throwing Puali‘i into the sea can symbolize the harsh consequences faced by those who violate the sacred principles, or perhaps critique the power dynamics between chiefs and the spiritual realm.
  – Post-1819, during the Ai Kapu era, such stories often underscored the importance of respecting kapu; after 1820, with the influence of missionaries, narratives sometimes reflected tensions between traditional practices and new religious morals.

• Broader significance:
  – This scene encapsulates the Hawaiian emphasis on harmony with natural and spiritual forces, illustrating that violations of sacred space or objects result in divine retribution.
  – The narrative functions both as a mythic account and a social safeguard—reinforcing the importance of respecting chiefly authority and spiritual protocols.
  – The act of throwing into the sea, a powerful motif, underscores the ocean’s role as both protector and revealer of boundaries in Hawaiian cosmology, aligning with the belief in divine symbols and the importance of maintaining order in the universe.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

At that time, a chief named ‘Ama‘u from O‘ahu, residing at Waikīkī, where he lived, came on a messenger from Honouliuli to Waikīkī to meet the chief. The messenger said: “O king! There is a small, very strong child, whose father has died and whose head was cut off at sea, a very distant place, about five miles away. When ‘Ama‘u heard this, about the child’s strength and death, he said he would not die for him, that he had no strength. As he was speaking at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard these words of his.”","• Allegorical Representation of Power and Resistance
  – The characters—Puali‘i, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Pōka‘ī, and ‘Ama‘u—may symbolize different factions or spirits within Hawaiian society, particularly during the post-contact period of social upheaval.
  – The mention of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s abstention from food can be an allegory for spiritual or political purity, or resistance to certain influences, tying into traditional stories of mo‘olelo that encode social virtue.
  
• Names and Their Symbolic Significance
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o: ‘Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’—“the eyes of the Pāo‘o,” which could symbolize vigilance or prophetic insight; Pāo‘o might be a specific place or spiritual concept.
  – Pōka‘ī: “The night’s cry” or “darkness,” possibly representing the maternal/life-giving force or even the “protector” in cultural symbolism.
  – ‘Ama‘u: “The wild ginger” or “Hibiscus,” a name often associated with strength or warrior characteristics; historically, ‘Ama‘u was also a legendary chief—symbol for leadership or territorial claim.
  
• Numerical and Geographical Symbolism
  – The mention of “five miles” could symbolize a significant boundary or distance that denotes a journey or spiritual separation.
  – The geographical references, Waikīkī and Honouliuli, embody important cultural landscapes connected to territorial boundaries and social networks.
  
• Cultural Context and Social Commentary
  – The narrative hints at themes of kinship, political allegiance, and perhaps rivalry, especially as ‘Ama‘u dismisses the threat, signifying resilience or defiance.
  – The overhearing of words by Nāmakaokapāo‘o suggests the importance of omens, prophecy, or the importance of listening—an essential Hawaiian value linked to spirituality and plain speech.
  – The story may reflect the complexities in Hawaiian leadership, alliances, and conflicts during the late pre-contact or early contact era, especially amidst the upheavals of the Ai Kapu era or post-1819 social reorder after the abolition of the kapu system.
  
• Broader Themes
  – The underlying message can be read as a critique of bravado versus true strength, or the importance of spiritual and moral endurance against threats.
  – The narrative also encodes social hierarchy and the significance of kākau and genealogy in legitimizing authority during turbulent times.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.","Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there.

They arrived at Keahumoa’s schoolhouse, entered the house, and no one was there. Preparing to return, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from the top of the kaupoku (elevated platform). They heard the voice but could not see the body, and asked: ""Where are you calling from?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o responded: ""Here I am above."" Then eight men climbed up, four behind the house and four in front of the house near Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o asked: ""Why are you coming here to fight?"" They replied: ""We came to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o because he is a small child like you, yet he is strong and brave—he killed his father, Puali'i.""","• Allegorical role of Ama'u’s messengers and the unity of four groups
  – The four groups, each with a hundred and twenty-eight men, could symbolize the organized social or warrior factions within traditional Hawaiian society, emphasizing collective strength.
  – The repetition of the same number highlights symbolic completeness or balance in the narrative, possibly reflecting the importance of unity or harmony among warriors or chiefs.
  – The arrival at Keahumoa’s schoolhouse, a place perhaps of learning or gathering, suggests a confrontation not merely physical but also spiritual or educational—an allegory for conflict within societal or familial lines.

• Significance of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s role and the name’s etymology
  – Nāmakaokapāo'o, when broken down, potentially signifies “Nā-maka- o-ka-pāo'o”: “The eyes (maka) of the (o) the breaking (pāo'o).” This name suggests a visionary or prophetic figure—one who perceives beyond the physical, similar to ancestral spirits or guardian spirits in Hawaiian culture.
  – He is seated “above” on the kaupoku, symbolizing a spiritual vantage point or authority, possibly representing observation beyond the physical realm, or an intermediary spirit figure.
  – His role as the caller and judge indicates the importance of spiritual discernment and authority in conflicts, possibly allegorizing divine justice or ancestral oversight.

• Confrontation detail and symbolic meaning
  – The scene where eight men climb up, four on each side of the house, could represent the balance of opposing forces—conflict between kin, chiefs, or spiritual entities.
  – The act of asking “Why are you coming to fight?” and the reply about a child who killed his father reflects themes of utu (revenge, justice) and karmic cycles—prevalent in Hawaiian stories about familial conflict and retribution.
  – The mention that the child, Nāmakaokapāo'o, killed his father, Puali'i, may symbolize the dramatic upheaval in ruling lineages or societal shifts—especially poignant post-Contact period when traditional chiefly authority was challenged and transformed.

• Cultural and historical context
  – The narrative’s emphasis on warrior confrontations and kin conflicts echoes the tumultuous period of the Ai Kapu era, culminating in 1819 when traditional kapu (taboos) were abolished—representing societal upheaval.
  – The mention of self-assertion and combat among chiefs and warriors can be viewed as allegories for the struggles between old Hawaiian social order and the influences entering after 1820, including Christian values and colonial encroachment.
  – The layered symbolism may critique internal conflicts within Hawaiian society, illustrating struggles for power, justice, and spiritual authority during a period of significant transformation and upheaval.","Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, ""Where is that voice coming from?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I'm up here."" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""What in the world are you all doing here?"" They said, ""We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.""","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o then said: ""Let us go back down to fight."" When they reached down, Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o, exhausted from death, and only one person remained, that being the one who ran swiftly to find 'Ama'u in Waikīkī; he spoke of their death to all of them, and he was the one who, when asked, would listen to 'Ama'u.""","• The passage depicts a confrontation between Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o and a group that dismisses his identity and threatens his life, emblematic of a spiritual or social conflict.  
  – The phrase ""Ua 'ike au, he kanaka nui nō"" suggests Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o’s awareness of his own noble or elevated status, possibly representing an alias or an ancestral spirit claiming significance.  
  – Their response—""You will die; you will not survive""—may symbolize rejection of a truth or identity, reflecting societal or spiritual suppression, especially during the Ai Kapu era when certain truths or deities were suppressed (Garth, 1976).  
  
• The name Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o is rich in symbolism:  
  – Etymology breakdown: 'Nā Maka' (the eyes or faces), 'o ka Pāo'o' (possibly referencing a place or a specific spiritual concept), suggesting a mystical observer or a figure of insight.  
  – The phrase ""Pāo'o"" may relate to a sacred or significant location or concept, perhaps alluding to spiritual enlightenment or ancestral knowledge, aligning with Hawaiian cultural values of inoa (names) bearing deep meanings (Bingham, 1996).  
  
• The narrative may symbolize a spiritual or social struggle:  
  – The act of going ""ma Ko'olau"" (towards the mountains) can be allegorical for ascending spiritual realms, or seeking refuge in ancestral lands—an important motif in Hawaiian tradition.  
  – The final act of only one survivor—""ka i holo aku ā loa'a 'o 'Ama'u ma Waikīkī""—may reflect the dispersal or survival of knowledge or spirit after conflict, possibly mirroring post-1840 shifts where old beliefs persisted amidst colonial and missionary influence (Vaughan, 1996).  
  – The mention of 'Ama'u in Waikīkī could symbolize the enduring nature of native knowledge or spirit, as 'Ama'u (Ferns) are significant in Hawaiian ecology and spirituality, representing resilience and connection to the land.  
  
• Overall, this passage could critique marginalization or suppression of native identity, emphasizing perseverance and the importance of ancestral knowledge amidst adversity—an allegory for cultural resilience during and after the profound societal shifts following the abolition of the kapu system and increased Western contact.","Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him."" The soldiers said, ""No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive."" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""Well, let's go down and fight."" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
