namakaokapaoo_ch1_p1,1,1,"He keiki ‘u‘uku loa ‘o **a)** Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a he  keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio, ‘a‘ohe ona lua  ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau, i ka  ‘u‘uku a me ke koa loa. **b1)** ‘O Kauluakaha‘i, kona   makua kāne, **c)** no Kahikipapaialewa, he ‘āina i  Kahikinu‘u. **b2)** ‘O Pōka‘ī ka makuahine. **c)** He ali‘i  nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa, a **b1)** he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona.","Nāmakaokapāo'o was a very small child, yet a very strong boy in his youth. There was no equal to him in these islands from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau in his smallness and great bravery. Kauluakaha‘i, his father, was from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa and also a divine being.","• This opening paragraph follows a traditional narrative structure typical in Hawaiian oral and written storytelling, setting the foundations for character introduction and genealogical context:

  – **a) Protagonist Introduction:** Nāmakaokapāo'o is presented first, emphasizing two contrasting attributes: his small physical size (""keiki ‘u‘uku loa"") alongside exceptional strength and bravery (""keiki ikaika loa""). This juxtaposition is a common motif in Hawaiian mo‘olelo, where physical stature does not limit mana or prowess. His youth (""kona wā ‘ōpiopio"") highlights his formative stage, underscoring potential for growth and significance.

  – The phrase ""‘a‘ohe ona lua"" (""he had no equal"") is a strong superlative establishing Nāmakaokapāo'o as unique and peerless across multiple islands—from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau—denoting his renown and the widespread recognition of his qualities.

• **b1) Patrilineal Introduction:** The text specifies the father, Kauluakaha‘i, anchoring Nāmakaokapāo'o’s identity within a chiefly lineage. 

  – The compound name Kauluakaha‘i can be dissected: ""Ka ulu a Kaha‘i"" roughly translates as ""the inspiration (ulu) of Kaha‘i,"" referring likely to a heroic ancestor figure, Kaha‘i, who features in Hawaiian mythology as a voyager and cultural hero (see Pukui & Elbert 1977:385). Thus, Kauluakaha‘i embodies inherited heroic mana and models a link between the protagonist and greater mytho-historical tradition.

  – The specification that Kauluakaha‘i is from Kahikipapaialewa situates him geographically and cosmologically. ""Kahiki"" traditionally denotes a foreign or ancestral homeland often linked with Tahiti or the broader Polynesian world. The suffix ""papaialewa"" combines ""papa"" (foundation or layer) and ""ialewa"" (in the heavens), denoting a high land or heavenly tier—likely a chiefly realm within the Kahiki concept, symbolizing elevated status or sacredness.

  – Importantly, Kauluakaha‘i is described as ""he ali‘i nui"" (a great/high chief), indicating elevated chiefly rank and political power, which confers noble status on Nāmakaokapāo'o.

• **b2) Matrilineal Introduction:** Pōka‘ī is introduced as the mother, a vital figure in Hawaiian genealogical recounting even if less elaborated.

  – The name Pōka‘ī potentially derives from ""pō"" (night/darkness) and ""ka‘i"" (to lead or to brush aside), possibly translating metaphorically as ""night that leads"" or ""darkness that guides,"" evoking subtle spiritual or symbolic resonance, though this may require contextual confirmation.

  – Unlike her husband’s detailed status, she is named simply without rank attribution, suggesting the narrative focus is patrilineal or that her chiefly status, if any, is less emphasized in this account. However, her presence stabilizes familial ties in the narrative.

• **c) Geographical and Cosmic Placement:**

  – The repeated use of ""no Kahikipapaialewa, he ‘āina i Kahikinu‘u"" localizes the father’s origin, aligning with the Hawaiian tradition of emphasizing the protagonist’s lineage tied to specific sacred lands.

  – ""Kahikinu‘u"" can be read as ""Kahiki of the summit"" or ""high Kahiki,"" reinforcing a celestial or exalted spatial realm connected to mythic or ancestral homelands, often mythologized in Hawaiian genealogies.

• **b1) Divinity and High Rank:** 

  – The characterization of Kauluakaha‘i as ""he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona"" (""partly or somewhat godly"" / ""having a divine aspect"") introduces a semi-divine status, common in Hawaiian chiefly genealogies whereby ali‘i trace descent to akua (gods) to legitimate and eternalize their authority and power (mana).

  – This element situates the narrative within cosmological frameworks where genealogy links the earthly chiefly line directly to divine realms, situating Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o as a figure of semi-divine heritage, setting the stage for his exceptional traits.

• **Cultural Implications:**

  – The emphasis on lineage and connection to Kahiki points to the importance of migration and origin stories in Hawaiian identity, reflecting a shared Polynesian worldview where genealogies confer mana and place the characters within a sacred cosmological geography.

  – The brief but potent description of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s strength and unmatched status could allegorize emergent leadership, highlighting the fusion of mortal and divine traits as a justification for his central role in subsequent narratives.

  – The small stature contrasted with great courage and power may metaphorically suggest themes of underestimated potential and the value of spiritual or ancestral strength over mere physical size.

In summary, this paragraph succinctly yet richly establishes Nāmakaokapāo'o’s identity by intertwining physical attributes, genealogical connections, and divine heritage, reflecting core Hawaiian cultural priorities in mo‘olelo: genealogy (mo‘okū‘auhau), place (wahi pana), and mana (spiritual power). It sets the stage for a heroic narrative grounded in traditional cosmology and social hierarchy.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This initial chapter unfolds the foundational narrative of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, situating him as a paradoxical figure marked simultaneously by his diminutive physical stature and extraordinary strength. His characterization as a singularly powerful youth “from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau” establishes an archetypal hero motif deeply embedded in Hawaiian oral tradition, where might and mana (spiritual power) often transcend ordinary physicality. The genealogy introduced—his father Kauluakaha‘i, a high chief and divine being of Kahikipapaialewa, and his mother Pōka‘ī—places Nāmakaokapāo‘o within the cosmological and chiefly hierarchies pivotal to traditional Hawaiian social structure. This genealogy aligns with well-recognized Polynesian patterns of semi-divine chiefly descent enhancing narrative authority and sanctity.

The narrative’s unfolding in ʻEwa, particularly at locations such as Honouliuli and Keahumoa with enduringly named sweet potato patches, grounds the story within a tangible geographic and socio-agricultural frame familiar to native Hawaiians. These place names and agrarian references extend a cultural mnemonic, evoking the subsistence practices and land relationships central to indigenous Hawaiian life and identity. The agricultural motif—the cultivation and eventual uprooting of the sweet potato patches—performs a dual symbolic and literal role: it signifies both the common baseline of Hawaiian labor and a disruption of established order instigated by Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s will, presaging his subsequent ascendancy.

The complex domestic tensions—most notably the antagonistic dynamic with Puali‘i, the stepfather figure—enact a profound allegory of intrafamilial conflict and competing claims to power. Puali‘i’s expressed intent to kill Nāmakaokapāo‘o to consume his head alongside sweet potatoes symbolically conflates political subjugation, ritualistic consumption, and domination themes pervasive in Hawaiian mythopoetics. Here, the stepfather’s violent threat reflects historical contestations over chiefly authority and legitimacy. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s protective pule (prayer) invoking ancestral chiefs Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻa exemplifies the invocation of genealogical power and cosmological sanction as metaphysical armor, a motif that underscores Hawaiian notions of spiritual protection and the intertwining of genealogy with agency.

The miraculous self-defense—where Puali‘i’s blade turns upon him, beheading the aggressor whose disembodied head converses post-mortem—transcends naturalistic narrative and operates on the mythic level, conveying themes of retributive justice and the empowerment of the marginalized. This subversion of the aggressor’s violence signifies a reframing of physical vulnerability, situating Nāmakaokapāo‘o as not merely resilient but supernaturally defended, thereby marking his emergence as a potent chiefly contender.

The subsequent military episodes involving ‘Ama‘u, chief of Waikīkī, foreground inter-chiefly warfare motifs endemic in historical Hawai‘i. The dispatch of war parties and eventual demise of ‘Ama‘u articulate the consolidation of power by Nāmakaokapāo‘o on Oʻahu, paralleling oral histories of aliʻi nui (paramount chiefs) whose martial prowess effected hegemonic control. His acts of violent dominance and strategic cunning reflect archetypes of culturally sanctioned rulership, while simultaneously evoking the broader sociopolitical realities of pre-contact Hawai‘i—where chiefly lineages contended through both genealogical entitlement and military might.

The preservation of this narrative in precise topographic terms coupled with culturally resonant motifs highlights its function beyond myth: it operates as a vehicle for cultural memory, identity affirmation, and territorial legitimation. The sweet potato patches named after Nāmakaokapāo‘o especially underscore how landscape and storywork interpenetrate, embedding narrative authority into land tenure and usage—a common feature in Hawaiian historiography.

Temporally, while the narrative evokes an archaic past suffused with cosmological significance, its first known print appearances appear to coincide with the late 19th century’s turbulent Hawaiian political environment, as discerned in similar extant texts. The symbolic obliteration of the stepfather Puali‘i—a stand-in for internal threats—and the martial triumph over ʻAma‘u may allegorically mirror the sociopolitical upheavals following the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893. This suggests potential layers of post-contact re-interpretation wherein indigenous narratives serve dual functions: simultaneously conserving ancestral knowledge and negotiating contemporary colonial disempowerment.

In sum, Chapter 1 is seminal in framing Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a potent emblem of indigenous resistance, sovereignty, and reconfiguration of power. Its intertwining of genealogy, location, ritual prayer, and martial exploits contributes richly to Hawaiian literary canons, embodying a complex dialectic between vulnerability and invincibility, subordination and ascendency. The chapter demands scholarly attention not only for its intrinsic mythic structure and cultural resonance but also as a possible site of political commentary and identity assertion amid the pressures of colonial transition."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Pōka‘ī was pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land; Pōka‘ī continued living with her pregnancy, and later, she gave birth. During this birth, Pōka‘ī and her child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, were considered very destitute.","• This paragraph introduces important contextual information about the conception, pregnancy, and birth of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, with specific references to place, relationships, and social conditions:
  
  – **‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa:** The naming of this place serves not only as a geographical location but also as a cultural setting. ‘Ewa is a prominent district on O‘ahu, and ‘Hō‘ae‘ae’ literal meaning is “to shake or to tremble repeatedly” which may connote turbulence or significant change, symbolically mirroring the disruptions in the story. Locating the conception here situates the narrative within a real and meaningful ahupua‘a or land division, emphasizing the importance of land as a place of both physical and genealogical origins.

  – **Launa kino & Moe:** The phrase “launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho” explicitly expresses physical intimacy leading to procreation. In Hawaiian tradition, the act of ‘launa’ indicates a meeting or joining, and when followed by ‘kino’ (body) it connotes sexual relations. ‘Moe’ specifically means to lie down or sleep, emphasizing the act of coupling. The directness reflects the narrative style of genealogies and mo‘olelo (stories) that acknowledge human relationships realistically.

• **Character dynamics and roles:**

  – **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o:** This name carries significant symbolic meaning. Literally, “the eyes of the pāo‘o” (a type of fish). Eyes (‘maka’) often symbolize vision, insight, or a gateway to the soul in Hawaiian thought, while pāo‘o fish may carry further metaphorical or genealogical significance. His conception here ties him intimately to both place and parentage, and his birth in hardship foreshadows possible challenges or transformations to come.

  – **Pō-ka-‘ī:** The mother, whose name can be broken down into ‘Pō’ (night/darkness) + ‘ka‘ī’ (to lead or guide), perhaps signifying a guided darkness or a figure associated with transition. That she hāpai (was pregnant) with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o alone after Kauluakaha‘i’s return to his land highlights a potential social and familial dynamic that may reflect customary practices or narrative motifs surrounding separation, responsibility, or the nature of relationships.

  – **Kauluakaha‘i:** His return “ho‘i” to his ‘āina (land) indicates a departure from the mother and child, which may underscore themes of absence, responsibility, or the tension between personal desires and chiefly duties. This is critical in Hawaiian genealogical narratives where chiefly presence or absence influences status and destiny.

• **Social and cultural implications of hānau (birth) and condition:**

  – The phrase “he ‘ilihune loa” denotes a state of extreme destitution or poverty for Pōka‘ī and her newborn, indicative not merely of material lack but possibly exclusion from chiefly status or community support. ‘Ilihune often refers to a poor or oppressed person and may carry social stigma. This aligns with traditional Hawaiian mo‘olelo where hardship at birth often serves as a catalyst for later deeds or transformation.

  – The hardship surrounding birth and early life often functions allegorically in Hawaiian narratives to foreshadow a hero’s challenging journey or the eventual subversion of initial lowliness to greatness.

• **Contextual and narrative function:**

  – The paragraph serves as a crucial connective tissue between the introduction of characters (Example 1) and the subsequent developments in their relationships and life circumstances (Examples 2 and 3).

  – It reflects a common mechanism in Hawaiian storytelling where geographic specificity anchors genealogical events, underscoring the indigenous worldview that genealogy, land (‘āina), and personhood are inextricably linked.

  – The acknowledgement of poverty at birth also humanizes the main protagonist, making any future accomplishments more dramatic and culturally resonant.

• **Broader cultural-historical perspectives:**

  – This narrative likely resonates with ‘Ai Kapu era contexts, where chiefly lineage (‘ali‘i) and birth circumstances critically determined a person’s social trajectory, yet stories often emphasized that status could be contested or transformed by personal virtues or divine favor.

  – The emphasis on conception at a specific place and subsequent hardship could allegorize tensions between generational transitions, indigenous notions of mana (spiritual power), and sociopolitical realities of land and lineage control.

In summary, this paragraph uses place, intimate relationship, and social condition to frame Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s origins in a culturally grounded and symbolically potent manner, setting the stage for his role as both a literal and allegorical figure within Hawaiian mo‘olelo tradition.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and liked her, and said: “I want you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī replied: “How could you want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is blemished.” Puali‘i answered: “Those things don’t matter. If you like me, let us sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed. Then Pōka‘ī went with her man, Puali‘i, to live at the plains of Keahumoa.","• **Introduction of a New Character and Place:**
  – The passage introduces Puali‘i, described as *he kanaka maika‘i* (“a good man”), emphasizing his positive character traits. His connection to Līhu‘e situates him geographically on Kaua‘i island, a significant detail that subtly anchors the narrative in a real locale.
  – Puali‘i’s arrival at Honouliuli for fishing shows traditional Hawaiian subsistence activities and suggests interconnectedness between places and people. Honouliuli, often translated as “dark bay,” situates the scene at a coastal fishing site, indicative of everyday life engaging with natural resources.

• **Cultural Practice of Visiting and Courtship:**
  – Puali‘i’s act of *kipa* (visiting) Pōka‘ī’s home aligns with Hawaiian customs of hospitality and open visitation during the ‘Ai Kapu era and prior, when social visits were common and expected, especially in small communities.
  – The courtship dialogue demonstrates Hawaiian attitudes toward relationships:
    * Puali‘i openly expresses his desire (*makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u* “I want you to be my woman”), highlighting straightforward communication in Hawaiian courtship.
    * Pōka‘ī expresses hesitance due to her perception of being less desirable after childbirth (*ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino* “I have given birth to a child and my body is blemished”). This self-effacing modesty reflects cultural nuances surrounding femininity, fertility, and body image within traditional community expectations.
    * Puali‘i counters with reassurance that these physical or social conditions are unimportant, emphasizing *ka makemake* (mutual desire) as the foundation for partnership and cohabitation.
  – Their decision to *e moe kāua* (“let us sleep together”) signals forming a traditional relationship, possibly a steady partnership or marriage-like union, without complicated formalities—a natural and pragmatic approach to relational commitments.

• **Symbolism in Name and Place:**
  – *Puali‘i* can be analyzed linguistically:
    * *Pua* (“flower”) often symbolizes beauty, life, or lineage.
    * *Li‘i* literally means “chief” or reflects high rank.
    * Together, *Puali‘i* may imply “flower of the chiefs” or a man of chiefly beauty/virtue, aligning well with his depiction as *he kanaka maika‘i*.
  – *Pōka‘ī*’s name evokes complexities:
    * *Pō* means “night,” possibly signifying mystery or depth.
    * *Ka‘ī* can be “to surround” or “to enclose,” suggesting protection or secrecy.
    * This could reflect her initial reluctance or her role as a protective figure—for herself and her child.
  – Relocation to *Keahumoa* (“heap of chickens”), a place name, carries symbolic weight. Chickens had ritual and subsistence value; the place might evoke abundance, life, or domestic stability, fitting the new family unit’s establishment.

• **Social Norms and Gender Roles in Historical Context:**
  – Pōka‘ī’s concern about her body after childbirth reveals sensitive cultural attitudes surrounding fertility and female sexuality. The fact that childbirth does not preclude desire or partnership, however, reflects Hawaiian cultural acceptance of women’s central role in family continuity despite physical changes.
  – Puali‘i’s acceptance embodies an inclusive kinship model and practical social alliances, which underpin community stability.
  – Their union and movement to a new home represents both literal and metaphorical growth—a new phase of life following the uncertainties of single motherhood.

• **Narrative Function and Allegorical Implications:**
  – This episode highlights the merging of life continuities: from single parenthood to partnership, from individual survival to shared household.
  – Allegorically, Puali‘i may symbolize the restorative force of love and acceptance that heals perceived imperfections, echoing broader Hawaiian values of *pono* (rightness, balance) in relationships.
  – The setting of a fishing expedition transforming into a visiting and ultimately a romantic encounter suggests the connection between sustenance of the land/sea and sustenance of social life.
  – This reflects the larger thematic pattern of movement—from isolation to integration, from wilderness to domestication—which is a recurrent motif in Hawaiian narrative traditions.

• **Additional Cultural Notes:**
  – The straightforward prose and openness in their interaction reflect pre-contact Hawaiian social realities, before European-influenced concepts of courtship altered norms.
  – The passage implicitly underscores *‘ohana* (family), where new partnerships form organically for collective well-being rather than formal contracts.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

And the sweet potato was good, Puali'i said in his promised words, ""There is the head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato cooked, and Puali'i will eat, and then it is free to be eaten by his wife, Pōka'ī, and the others. So Puali'i went down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat together with the sweet potato.""","**Paragraph 4:**

• This passage continues the narrative situated at the location where the main figures reside and cultivate food, focusing on the cultivation of sweet potatoes (special emphasis on two long patches or māla) which are highlighted as enduring landmarks named Nāmakaokapāo'o, linking the place and person symbolically.

– The phrase ""elua āna mau māla ʻuala lōʻihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā"" emphasizes longevity and continuity: these two ʻuala patches have been maintained over generations and remain recognized by name. Naming the cultivated land after Nāmakaokapāo'o integrates individual identity with place, reflecting a common Hawaiian naming practice that endorses genealogical and land ties.

– The name Nāmakaokapāo'o breaks down as Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o: 
 • Nā (the plural definite article, ""the"")
 • maka (eyes)
 • o (of)
 • ka pāo'o (pāo'o: a name with literal meaning partly related to a small fish, pāo'o, but here with poetic resonance also connected with 'head'; the compound name includes multiple layers of meaning suggesting ‘the eyes of the pāo'o’ or metaphorically ‘keen sight’ or ‘far-reaching vision’).  
This linkage indicates both the land's and the person’s attributes tied closely with vision, perception, and possibly vigilance. Naming land after a person suggests ancestral stewardship and responsibility for resources.

• Puali'i’s dialogue introduces a formalized meal featuring cooked sweet potato (ʻuala) paired symbolically with the head of the ulua fish (poʻo o ka ʻulua), which holds significant ritual and cultural meaning in Hawaiian tradition.

– Ulua (Caranx ignobilis) was a prized fish, and the fish head holds ceremonial importance. The combination of the ulua’s head with sweet potato can be interpreted as a sacred offering or a symbolic meal, perhaps formalizing Puali'i’s claim or blessing. Puali‘i’s “ōlelo hoʻohiki” (promised or vowed words) confirm this act as solemn and binding.

– The expression “Noa” after Puali‘i’s consumption carries nuanced cultural significance: “noa” in Hawaiian worldviews often means free from kapu (restriction), symbolizing the lifting of a prohibitive state or the blessing that the food is now free to be shared. Thus, by consuming the head of the ulua and sweet potato himself, Puali‘i ritually lifts any kapu on the food, allowing his wife Pōka‘ī and others to partake without restriction.

• This ritualized dining act underscores Hawaiian concepts of ʻai kapu (sacred eating or food restrictions) during the ancient kapu system, where persons of rank, rituals, and food preparation were strictly regulated. Puali‘i’s statement and action suggest an assertion of authority and control over food resources and relational bonds—a custom with real implications in maintaining social and familial order.

• Finally, Puali‘i’s movement ""iho aku i kai o Honouliuli e lawai‘a"" (came down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish) completes the picture of subsistence and resourcefulness rooted in both land and sea—fundamental Hawaiian concepts of mālama ʻāina (caring for the land) and kai (sea). 

– Honouliuli (modern day area on the island of Oʻahu) was a real place known for abundant fishing grounds, emphasizing the integration of place and sustenance.

– The phrase “lawaiʻa i iʻa ʻai pū me ka ʻuala” (fish for fish to eat together with the sweet potato) symbolizes the balanced diet combining ocean and land resources, central to Hawaiian foodways. This harmonious gathering indicates cooperation between natural elements and people’s roles.

• Allegorically, the passage signifies continuity and harmony between generations, people and ʻāina, social structure and ritual. The enduring sweet potato gardens named after Nāmakaokapāo'o root the narrative in legacy and genealogy; the ceremonial eating anchors the social bonds through shared ritualized food; the fishing trip links the community to the sea, reaffirming the Hawaiian relation to environment and tradition.

This paragraph thus deepens the theme of interconnection—between individual, land, sustenance, ritual authority, and social relationships—via place names, foods, and promises, all underscoring the layered worldview of Hawaiian culture.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s body at that time was very small, two kapua‘i and a half of his height, not yet fully developed, still immature. When they arrived at the sweet potato patches, he said to the children, “Pull up the mounds along with all the sweet potato leaves on top, don’t leave any growing.” But the children were afraid, so they carefully controlled themselves with the sweet potatoes, not pulling up the mounds.","**Paragraph 5:**  
• This paragraph situates Nāmakaokapāo‘o within a group of seventeen children working together in the agricultural setting of Puali‘i’s sweet potato (ʻuala) patches. The coordination of many children (he ʻumi kumamāhiku) highlights communal labor, an important aspect of traditional Hawaiian farming practices where mo‘opuna or keiki were often involved under adult supervision.  
• The presence of seventeen children is significant: seventeen (ʻumi kumamāhiku) is a relatively large number, possibly symbolic of community strength or collective responsibility. It may also be a semi-symbolic “many” rather than a literal headcount. Hawaiian oral narratives often use numbers to convey magnitude and emphasize social dynamics.

• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s physical description is both precise and poetic:  
  – “Two kapua‘i and a half his height” places him as very small and childlike. The *kapua‘i* is a traditional Hawaiian unit of measure approximately the length of a clenched fist or about four inches (10 cm), though it can vary regionally. Two and a half kapua‘i indicates a stature roughly 10 inches tall—emphasizing his youth and vulnerability.  
  – His description as “not fully mature” or “not yet fully formed” (ʻaʻole i pa‘a kona ma‘i, e lewalewa ana nō) conveys both a literal physical immaturity and perhaps a symbolic psychological or emotional immaturity. The term *ma‘i*, commonly meaning disease or illness, here likely refers figuratively to an undeveloped or weak condition.  
  – The juxtaposition of his diminutive size with the leadership role of giving instructions to the other children may indicate narrative tension between apparent weakness and emerging strength or responsibility—common in hero narratives. 

• The agricultural task itself reflects traditional Hawaiian sweet potato cultivation practices:  
  – The instruction “pull up the mounds along with all the sweet potato leaves on top, don’t leave any growing” suggests complete harvesting and clearing. In Hawaiian agriculture, *pu‘e* refers to a planting mound, which is cultivated carefully for *uala* tubers. Removing leaves and vines entirely helps stop regrowth, indicating a planned harvest cycle.  
  – The directive to “not leave any growing” also has potential metaphoric significance. It can symbolize transformation or clearing away old growth to make way for the new, consistent with themes of renewal in Hawaiian land stewardship (*malama ‘aina*).  
  – The children’s fear (maka‘u nō) to fully pull up the mounds suggests a hesitation to disrupt or destroy the life-giving plants—a cultural respect for the land (*aina*) and its sustaining power, but also imperative caution among keiki. This ambivalence aligns with Hawaiian concepts of reciprocity between humans and nature, where harvesting is done mindfully and respectfully.

• The contrast between Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s firm command and the children’s hesitation adds narrative depth:  
  – It may highlight his emerging assertiveness or a symbolic rupture with traditional cautiousness—he encourages decisive action, perhaps foreshadowing a disruptive role in the story.  
  – This aligns with the characterization seen in prior paragraphs, where Nāmakaokapāo‘o is both a child and a figure involved in challenging existing norms or provoking change. His youth and physical smallness contrast with his emerging agency.

• Cultural and narrative context:  
  – The presence of Puali‘i as a separate fishing character (although not directly interacting in this paragraph) sets up a duality between land (uala patches) and sea (fishing). This dichotomy is common in Hawaiian stories, symbolizing different realms of resource gathering and modes of life.  
  – The agricultural setting and child labor suggest a period either before or around the end of the ‘Ai Kapu era (pre-1819), when strict kapu governed social behavior including agricultural cycles and fishing rights. The caution shown by the children may be a remnant of ritual observance or fear of spiritual consequences, while Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s directive may symbolize the beginning of a new approach or defiance.

• Onomastic note:  
  – *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish) bears poetic and symbolic weight. The pāo‘o is a fish associated with sharp vision and keen observation; his name may metaphysically link him to perception and insight, despite his physical smallness and immaturity here.  
  – The imagery of “eyes” dovetails with themes of seeing beyond present limitations and potentially challenging established orders, consistent with his assertive actions as a youth among the children.

In summary, this paragraph portrays Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a physically small but increasingly assertive figure commanding a group of children to undertake an important agricultural task. The tension between his confident instructions and the children’s cautious restraint reflects cultural values of respect for land and possibly an allegory for forthcoming changes in tradition or social order. The detailed physical description anchors the character in the narrative as a youthful yet pivotal actor with symbolic potential tied to insight and transformation.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then, Nāmakaokapāo'o returned and lit a fire and began to broil four sweet potato vines on the fire that was burning. While he was broiling them over the fire, his harsh stepfather came back and asked his mother, Pōka'ī, who said, “No.” Puali'i said, “Yes, his head and eyes are the food to go with my sweet potatoes today, so today is the day he will die.”","• **Contextual Setting and Character Action:**  
  – The passage describes Nāmakaokapāo'o actively and destructively uprooting two sweet potato (ʻuala) patches, which is a critical staple crop and deeply symbolic in Hawaiian agriculture and sustenance practices. The action portrays him as energetically destructive, perhaps embodying a motif of youthful recklessness or an allegory of breaking from tradition.  
  – The quantity mentioned—“kanahā” (forty) mounds—may be symbolic rather than literal, as numbers in Hawaiian narratives often carry esoteric or pedagogical meanings. Forty could denote a generational or significant temporal dimension, invoking completeness or the fullness of a cycle in traditional Hawaiian numerology.  
  – The fact that both māla ‘uala (sweet potato patches) are uprooted to form this sizable heap of leaves suggests a deliberate, exhaustive destruction of the crop, reinforcing the impression of total upheaval or change.

• **Symbolism of the Sweet Potato and Agricultural Metaphor:**  
  – The sweet potato is a culturally significant staple introduced from abroad (likely via Polynesian voyaging), symbolizing nourishment, land connection, and the cyclical nature of growth and harvest.  
  – Uprooting the sweet potato plants can metaphorically represent the disruption of the established order, whether social, spiritual ('Ai Kapu system), or agricultural. The destructive action might parallel themes of transition, challenge to authority, or a break from the past toward new understandings.

• **Fire and Cooking as Ritual Context:**  
  – Nāmakaokapāo'o lighting a fire and ‘ōhinu (broiling) four sweet potato vines over it introduces a distinct image of ritualistic or purposeful cooking. The number four (ʻehā) may also carry symbolic weight—four cardinal directions, four elements, or foundational structures in Hawaiian cosmology.  
  – Broiling vines of sweet potato (maka) rather than tubers may highlight the importance of the regenerative parts of the plant—the vines are what propagate future crops—thereby symbolizing the vitality and continuity of the people and land.

• **Interpersonal Conflict and Threat of Violence:**  
  – The ""makua kāne kōlea"" (harsh or stern stepfather) returns and inquires of Pōka'ī, the mother, about Nāmakaokapāo'o’s fate. Pōka'ī’s reply is a firm “No,” likely denying consent or approval of any violent action.  
  – Puali'i, the stepfather, counters emphatically with “Yes,” declaring that Nāmakaokapāo'o’s head (poʻo) and eyes (maka) will be the food he eats with his sweet potatoes that day, indicating a literal or figurative threat to kill him. The head and eyes carry intense symbolic meaning—poʻo represents leadership, control, and identity; maka embody perception, knowledge, and life essence.  
  – This threat might signify a deeper struggle over power and authority within the family unit or community, perhaps reflecting tensions between tradition (represented by Puali'i and the 'Ai Kapu observance) and youthful rebellion or progressive thought (embodied by Nāmakaokapāo'o).

• **Allegorical and Cultural Analysis:**  
  – The passage may allegorically reference the tensions in Hawaiian society during the 'Ai Kapu era, specifically the conflict between orthodox religious practices, including ritual sacrifice, and emerging challenges to those norms.  
  – As noted in scholarly traditions (cf. Pukui & Elbert, 1986), the ulua fish was often a symbolic substitute in sacrifice rituals. Here, Puali'i’s expressed intent to consume Nāmakaokapāo'o's head and eyes in place of the ulua may invert or critique established ritual practice, highlighting the severity of his disposition and adherence to tradition.  
  – Conversely, Nāmakaokapāo'o's destruction of the crops can symbolize a repudiation of old customs and an assertion of change or reform, aligning with interpretations that see him as a figure of progressive intuition or reform against stagnant cultural mores.  
  – The mother Pōka'ī’s refusal to permit violence may emphasize maternal protection, a tension between the generational views on preserving life and tradition versus the harsh enforcement of norms by male authority figures.

• **Linguistic and Onomastic Notes:**  
  – The name “Nāmakaokapāo'o” breaks down as “Nā maka o ka pāo'o,” literally “The eyes of the pāo'o fish.” The pāo'o is a small fish, but the name may carry metaphorical resonance about keen perception or vigilance, correlating with his perceptive disruption of the status quo.  
  – Pōka'ī (“night falls upon the high chief” or “darkness envelops the chief”) may poetically suggest a maternal figure overshadowed by adversity or entanglement in conflict.  
  – Puali'i (“child/descendant of a chief,” or literally “high-born child”) signifies an individual aligned with chiefly power and authority, underscoring his role as enforcer of hierarchical order.

In summary, this passage juxtaposes youthful, disruptive energy represented by Nāmakaokapāo'o with the entrenched, stern authority embodied by Puali'i, set against the backdrop of agricultural rites and ritualistic symbolism. The threatening dialogue and destruction of vital crops metaphorically dramatize the broader cultural tensions in Hawaiian society concerning tradition, authority, and transformation during the 'Ai Kapu period.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw and ran away, stopping in a distant place because they were afraid of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! Here is the machete in my hand, a tool to cut your head today, then your head will be cooked with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat first, then you will be free.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not listen to these words of Puali‘i, so Puali‘i spoke a second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the machete when at that moment Nāmakaokapāo‘o prayed his death chant for Puali‘i. It went as follows:  
The eye of my head is only beloved,  
It flinches, it trembles,  
Should it eat, or should it allow,  
Allow Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,

This is my close companion,  
Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i,  
Let it glide, let the sting glide,  
People with spears,  
The spear with the club,  
Nāmakaokapāo‘o will truly die.","• **Contextual overview:**  
  – This paragraph portrays a dramatic confrontation between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o amid a tense, symbolic scene involving sweet potato vines and a threatening machete. Puali‘i’s threat to sever Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head is provocative and evokes themes of mortal conflict and ritual death, while Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prayer or chant responds with a mix of defiance and invocation of ancestral and divine power.

• **Characters and actions:**  
  – Puali‘i (likely “Chief’s descendant” or “chiefly boy”) here takes an aggressive stance, wielding a ko‘ilipi (machete), a tool sharpened for cutting and symbolic of power and punishment. His readiness to cut Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head (po‘o) — the locus of identity and mana — is a direct threat of death and domination.  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o, who earlier destroyed sweet potato patches, remains unyielding, ignoring Puali‘i’s first verbal warning and inspiring fear in nearby children. The children’s flight highlights the threat’s severity and adds a communal dimension to the scene, marking it as a moment of social tension.  
  – The specific action of “kunu” (piercing or skewering) four sweet potato vines atop the fire likely carries layered metaphorical meaning, involving destruction, sustenance, and a kind of ritual transformation (roasting the ‘uala vines and tubers).

• **Symbolism of the weapons and food:**  
  – The ko‘ilipi’s use is illustrative beyond the practical: as a cutting tool, it symbolizes finality, decisiveness, and the wielding of authority, particularly in conflicts involving chiefly rank or spiritual power.  
  – Puali‘i’s declaration that he will first eat Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head cooked with sweet potatoes (‘uala) allegorizes a dominant ‘consuming’ over the younger figure, inverting normal kinship protection and signaling a breakdown of harmony or expected interpersonal relations. Eating the head is metaphorically absorbing the person’s mana or identity, often considered a symbolic act of ultimate power over an adversary.

• **The death chant (pule make):**  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s pule make is rich with cultural and linguistic references:  
    * “The eye of my head is only beloved” (Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o): The ‘eye of the head’ is a poetic kenning referring to the essential, most beloved part of oneself — the head (po‘o) and its eyes (maka).  
    * “It flinches, it trembles” (E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei): Indicates vulnerability yet resilience or movement, a tension between fragility and resistance.  
    * “Should it eat, or should it allow” (E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha): Reflects a duality — whether to ‘consume’ or to ‘spare’— introducing ambiguity in fate and power relations.  
    * “Allow Nākukui‘aimakaokalani” (E waiho paha Nākukui‘aimakaokalani): Nākukui‘aimakaokalani is a highly significant name. Breaking it down:  
      – Nā-kukui – “the lights” or “candlenuts” (kukui nuts used for light), symbolizing enlightenment or guidance;  
      – ‘ai – “to eat” or “to use”;  
      – makaokalani – “eyes of the heavens” or “heavenly eyes” (“maka o ka lani”), invoking divine vision or protection.  
    This personal or ancestral name functions as a protective spirit or beloved companion invoked as a guardian or interceder.  
    * “That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani, this is my close companion,” reinforces the connection between the poem-speaker and this protective force.  
    * “Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i,” introduces another prominent name:   
      – Nāmakaokai‘a (“eyes that consume the sea” or “sea-eating eyes”) suggests a powerful chiefly or divine being associated with the ocean’s expanse and strength. This may be a symbolic ancestor or a spiritual protector invoked in the prayer.  
    * “Let it glide, let the sting glide,” may allegorize the movement of spears or mana penetrating the enemy.  
    * “People with spears, the spear with the club,” conjures traditional Hawaiian weapons of war, referencing physical and metaphorical battle, enhancing the lethal seriousness of the conflict.  
    * The closing line, “Nāmakaokapāo‘o will truly die,” accepts the possibility of death but juxtaposes it with defiant invocation and honor, indicating that even in death, there is mana and spiritual presence.

• **Cultural and symbolic implications:**  
  – The exchange embodies a metaphorical struggle between tradition and innovation, or elder authority and younger challenge. Puali‘i represents enforcement of established hierarchical order with threat of death and consumption of the rival’s essence.  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o counters not by submission but through sacred invocation, reinforcing his spiritual identity and connection to divine and chiefly ancestors through named protective figures. This reflects Hawaiian values of mana, connection to lineage, and the power of ritual speech (pule) in confronting mortal danger.  
  – The fact that Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s pule make is uttered exactly when Puali‘i is about to strike suggests the protective power of prayer and the liminal space between life and death underscored by spiritual agency.  
  – The use of four sweet potato vines (‘ehā) resonates with the earlier paragraph’s numeric motif involving 2, 4, 40, suggesting ritual numerology and coded meaning tied to cultivation, sustenance, and renewal, juxtaposed against the threat of destruction.

• **Linguistic notes:**  
  – The use of “‘E!” as an exclamation to get attention conveys Puali‘i’s aggressive tone.  
  – “Noa” in “then you will be free” or “then you may be free” carries layered meaning: it can mean “free” in opposition to “kapu,” implying liberation in death or absolution from suffering.

• **Overall allegorical interpretation:**  
  – This passage dramatizes the tension between destruction and preservation, physical violence and spiritual protection, asserting the enduring authority of ancestral and divine guardians despite mortal peril. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prayer situates him within a cosmological framework where death is not simply an end but a transformation mediated by mana and lineage.  
  – Puali‘i’s threat to consume Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head symbolically portrays power struggles over identity and mana, consistent with Hawaiian narratives where the ‘head’ is the seat of vital force.  
  – The invocation of named protective figures and chiefs within the pule make weaves individual fate into communal and cosmic orders, reflecting core Hawaiian worldviews about the interconnectedness of personal, genealogical, and spiritual realms.

In sum, this paragraph is a poignant nexus of physical threat, ritual response, and the assertion of identity through speech, deeply rooted in Hawaiian cultural concepts of mana, genealogy, and the sacred relationship between humans and the spirit world.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

Nāmakaokalani was the father and Nāmakaokaiʻa was the child; however, they entered into the prayer (pule) with Nāmakaokapāʻoʻo.","**Paragraph 8:**  
• This passage introduces two significant chiefly figures: Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻa, identified as aliʻi nui (high chiefs) of Hawaiʻi, underscoring their high rank and political status within the island society.  
   
• The names themselves bear rich linguistic and symbolic meaning:  
  – **Nāmakaokalani** can be parsed as *Nā-maka-o-ka-lani* meaning “the eyes of the heavens” or “the eyes of the chief,” combining *maka* (eye) and *lani* (heaven, chief, exalted). This suggests a chiefly personage whose vision or perception was linked to divine or celestial authority, emphasizing status and connection to the divine realm in Hawaiian cosmology.  
  – **Nāmakaokaiʻa** combines *Nā-maka-o-ka-iʻa*, “the eyes of the fish,” possibly referencing profound perception or vigilance connected metaphorically to fish, creatures of the ocean domain, perhaps symbolizing agility or adaptability. The term *kaiʻa* may also carry associations with fishing, sustenance, or oceanic power, common markers of rulership and resource control.  

• Familial relationships are clarified: Nāmakaokalani is the **makua kāne** (father), and Nāmakaokaiʻa is the **keiki** (child), indicating a paternal lineage of chiefly rank, vital for genealogical legitimization within the aliʻi system. This patrilineal link reaffirms the transmission of chiefly mana (spiritual/political power) and status through lineage.  

• Despite their high chiefly rank, the text states they “entered into the prayer (pule) of Nāmakaokapāʻoʻo,” a significant cultural note:  
  – The term **pule** denotes prayers, chants, or spiritual rituals often associated with protocol, kapu (tabu) observance, and divine protection or invitation. Their participation in Nāmakaokapāʻoʻo’s pule implies acknowledgment or submission to Nāmakaokapāʻoʻo’s spiritual or social authority within that context.  
  – This may reflect complex social hierarchies and political alliances where different aliʻi, even of high rank, recognized shared or differing spheres of power, particularly in religious or ceremonial settings.  
  – It hints at Nāmakaokapāʻoʻo’s possible elevated spiritual role or mana that compelled even other great chiefs to participate in his pule, indicating the nuanced interplay of political and spiritual power in aliʻi society.  

• Contextualizing historically and culturally:  
  – The naming conventions, genealogical disclosure, and mention of pule resonate with traditional Hawaiian moʻolelo (stories) that repeatedly affirm chiefly hierarchies, social order, and religious observances.  
  – Such groupings in a pule may indicate alliances, reconciliations, or cooperative power displays among chiefly lines, crucial in maintaining the rigid kapu system, especially the ‘Ai Kapu era structures.  
  – The fact that Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻa are linked with Nāmakaokapāʻoʻo through pule might also symbolize political unification efforts or intergenerational mana transmission in ritual form.  

• In summary, this short paragraph elegantly serves as a genealogical-ceremonial snapshot that:  
  1. Names and situates two aliʻi nui figures within the chiefly hierarchy of Hawaiʻi;  
  2. Clarifies their familial relationship, anchoring identity in lineage;  
  3. Reveals their participation in the spiritual domain of Nāmakaokapāʻoʻo, signaling religious-political affiliation or subordination;  
  4. Conveys deeper cultural themes regarding the intersection of genealogy, ritual, and chiefly power in Hawaiian society.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The head of Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo'o: “Greetings to you, Nāmakaokapāo'o.” Then Nāmakaokapāo'o took the head of Puali‘i and cast it into the sea at Waipouli, a bay by the shore of Honouliuli, which is five miles in length.","**Paragraph 9 Analysis:**

• **Narrative development:**  
– This passage relates a dramatic and supernatural event following the conflict between Nāmakaokapāo'o and Puali‘i introduced earlier. The completion of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s prayer ('pule') sets a sacred or ritualistic framework preceding a violent confrontation. The act of prayer may indicate a spiritual or protective action undertaken by Nāmakaokapāo'o before the ensuing conflict.

• **Etymology and symbolism of names:**  
– *Nāmakaokapāo'o* (lit. “the eyes of the pāo'o fish” or “the eyes of the headwind fish”): The name invokes vision and perception, possibly symbolizing insight or a prophetic gaze. The fish *pāo'o* is often associated with swiftness and elusiveness, underscoring Nāmakaokapāo'o’s qualities. His victorious role in this passage aligns with his symbolic ‘eyes’ that see beyond ordinary limits, overcoming Puali‘i.  
– *Puali‘i* (lit. “the royal child” or “offspring of chiefs”): This name situates the character in nobility or chiefly lineage, which elevates the significance of his defeat. However, despite chiefly status, his demise here might symbolize the overthrow of old authority or traditional power by a new force represented by Nāmakaokapāo'o.

• **Cultural aspects of the conflict:**  
– The use of a *ko‘ilipi*, a slicing or cleaving knife, is significant as these tools were traditionally used for cutting through tough material, including during warfare or ritual acts. The knife’s edge ‘turning back’ (‘ho‘ohuli aku’) onto Puali‘i introduces an element of supernatural justice or karmic retribution, a common motif in Hawaiian narratives indicating that a wrongful or violent act against a person with mana will backfire.  
– The severed head of Puali‘i speaks, a profound supernatural occurrence: in Hawaiian belief systems, the head (*po'o*) is the seat of mana (spiritual power), consciousness, and identity. The speaking head symbolizes that mana persists beyond physical death, allowing Puali‘i to extend his agency beyond the grave, conveying words of farewell or recognition.

• **Dialogue and meaning of the spoken words:**  
– The head’s greeting, “Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o,” is highly significant. The word *aloha* conveys love, compassion, respect, and reciprocal connection. Despite being decapitated, Puali‘i’s head offers a gesture of *aloha*—perhaps a form of reconciliation or acknowledging Nāmakaokapāo'o’s superior mana or rightful victory. This hints at a respectful resolution to their conflict, emphasizing the relational nature of power, even in enmity.  

• **Geographical and symbolic placement of the head:**  
– Nāmakaokapāo'o throws Puali‘i's head into the sea at *Waipouli*, near *Honouliuli*:  
   • *Waipouli* means “dark or shady water,” a coastal region known historically for its abundance and strategic location in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu. The sea as the final resting place of the head symbolizes a return to the source, the continuum of life and death, and possibly the cleansing or transformation of defeated enemies.  
   • The mention of “five miles long” as the length of the bay situates the account precisely in a recognizable landscape, linking mythic-historical narrative with tangible places, a common Hawaiian historiographical technique that grounds stories in place and identity.  
   • The casting into the sea also recalls traditional Hawaiian practices where significant items, remains, or symbols were offered or returned to the ocean, a realm seen as both origin and boundary, creating a liminal space for supernatural encounters.

• **Allegorical and thematic implications:**  
– This passage punctuates the transition from pluralistic human conflict to supernatural resolution, where physical violence is met with spiritual consequence. The incident can be interpreted as a metaphor for the turning tide of power between factions or eras, with Nāmakaokapāo'o embodying new mana or a new order overwhelming Puali‘i’s established but defeated power.  
– The animate severed head’s blessing functions as an archetype of surrender imbued with dignity, perhaps emblematic of the interconnectedness of adversaries within the Hawaiian value system, where respect is due even to enemies, and power must be acknowledged in proper relational terms.  
– The supernatural motif also reflects Hawaiian cosmology, where the boundaries between the natural and spiritual worlds are permeable, and objects (like heads) can retain agency.

• **Context with previous passages:**  
– Comparable to earlier scenes in this narrative where Puali‘i threatens to eat Nāmakaokapāo'o’s head and eyes as symbolic food, here we see a reversal: the head of Puali‘i is severed but survives as a communicative entity, highlighting the ongoing tension between the two characters as symbolic embodiments of cultural or temporal forces.  
– The passage reinforces the esoteric role of the *poʻo* and *maka* (head and eyes) motif that pervades the story, recalling earlier analysis in paragraph 6 about symbolic consumption and sacrifice practices related to the ‘Ai Kapu system and its eventual dismantling.

**Summary:**  
Paragraph 9 encapsulates a climactic supernatural moment that intertwines Hawaiian spiritual beliefs about mana, the sacredness of the head, place-based identity, and the moral consequences of human action. Through the defeat of Puali‘i by Nāmakaokapāo'o—and the speaking severed head’s expression of aloha—the text synthesizes themes of power, respect, transformation, and reconciliation within a spatially and culturally grounded Hawaiian worldview.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.

But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",

Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
