His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and was in part divine as well.","**Paragraph 1 Analysis:**

• This opening follows the time-honored Hawaiian narrative structure: it introduces the main protagonist, establishes parentage and ancestry, and situates the story within a specific geography—each element vital to Hawaiian identity, status, and the credibility of oral history.
  
  – **a) Protagonist Introduction:** The language, ""He keiki ‘u‘uku loa ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a he keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio,"" places emphasis on paradox: despite being very small in stature (‘u‘uku loa), Nāmakaokapāo‘o is remarkably strong (ikaika loa) in his childhood—a common motif in Hawaiian mo‘olelo where physical size belies spiritual or heroic capacity. This alludes to the Hawaiian value placed on mana, the inner spiritual force, over mere outward appearance.
  
  – “‘A‘ohe ona lua ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau, i ka ‘u‘uku a me ke koa loa” connotes the unrivaled nature of the hero across the archipelago. The phrase ""'a‘ohe ona lua"" is a traditional honorific signifying 'without equal.' In precontact Hawaiian society, superlative traits were recognized not only within a community, but in relation to the wider ‘āina and its connected peoples, underscoring kuleana (responsibility) and standing.

• **b) Parentage and Divine Lineage:**
  
  – **Kauluakaha‘i:** The father’s name, Ka-ulu-a-Kaha‘i (the inspiration/growth of Kaha‘i), hints at genealogical ties to major figures in Pacific voyaging lore. Kaha‘i is a heroic ancestor known for traversing to distant lands (notably ‘Upolu, Samoa), bringing back valuable crops like breadfruit (*‘ulu*), and seeking out his father, Hema, in Kahiki. Thus, the name suggests that Nāmakaokapāo‘o is directly descended from legendary voyagers and culture-bringers, positioning him as a figure of extraordinary heritage and expectations.
  
  – “He ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona” signals the belief that Kauluakaha‘i was “part-god” (a common motif documented in genealogies that legitimize chiefly power through divine descent). Within an ‘Ai Kapu context, such ancestry provides both political and sacred authority—suggesting that the exploits of Nāmakaokapāo‘o are not merely human, but carry cosmic significance. The assertion of an ""akua"" (godly) side also invites allegorical readings, where the protagonist's triumphs have implications for the balance between the human and divine orders.

  – **Pōka‘ī:** The mother, Pō-ka-‘ī, is named without detail, following the convention that high-ranking women are honored but often left enigmatic, perhaps implicitly referencing the sanctity or hiddenness of female kapu (sacredness) in Hawaiian society. The maternal line, while less elaborated here, is nonetheless crucial to the full mo‘okū‘auhau (genealogy) and the hero’s dual sources of mana.

• **c) Geography and Place:**
  
  – “Kahikipapaialewa, he ‘āina i Kahikinu‘u”—the use of place names is loaded with layered meaning. Kahiki, as noted in genealogical chants and migration traditions, refers to ancestral homelands beyond Hawai‘i, often situated somewhere in the mythic-religious cosmos (“kahiki” sometimes connoting “foreign lands,” “homelands” or the heavens, especially as “kahiki-nu‘u”/“summit Kahiki” implies vertical ascent). “Papa ia lewa” may be interpreted as ""stratum in the sky"" or ""floating stratum,"" linking place to cosmological layers. These places are not simply geographic but cosmological, connecting the earthly genealogy to celestial origins and spiritual authority.

  – Such specificity emphasizes that Nāmakaokapāo‘o, though reared in the islands, is of a lineage that transcends Hawai‘i, embodying both local rootedness and “kahiki” otherworldliness—a duality highly valued in ali‘i genealogies, used to navigate legitimacy and capability in both earthly and spiritual matters.

• **Allegorical Implications:**
  
  – The introductory focus on paradox—small size/great strength and local/foreign ancestry—reflects the Hawaiian worldview in which opposites coexist and create dynamism (cf. the concept of ""lōkahi,"" harmony through balanced diversity). Nāmakaokapāo‘o's story is thus set up as emblematic not just of personal adventure but a broader process: the integration (or conflict) between tradition and innovation, the seen and unseen, kanaka and akua. In the context of the ‘Ai Kapu era, such balance had real material consequences for governance and religion.

• **Concluding Observations:**
  
  – The structure and language of this passage establish the conventions of mo‘olelo: action anchored in family, place, and genealogy, highlighting that identity in Hawaiian tradition begins with—and continually returns to—origins and connections to the land and cosmos.

  – The narrative foundation laid here primes the listener/reader for a tale not solely of individual achievement, but of the maintenance, testing, or transcendence of inherited kapu and community values.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97).

Chapter 1 of the Nāmakaokapāo‘o narrative inaugurates a cycle of tales that straddle the line between traditional, archetypal mo‘olelo (narrative accounts) and pointed socio-political allegory. The passages foreground themes of heroic agency despite physical diminishment, the instability of familial and political power, and the transformative potential vested in outcasts and the socially marginalized. Through the depiction of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as the “very small boy” of tremendous strength, the text underscores a recurring motif in Polynesian and Hawaiian storytelling: that true mana (spiritual power) is unbounded by corporeal limitations, and greatness may reside in the most unassuming forms.

**1. Major Themes and Allegorical Meaning**

The structure of Chapter 1 positions Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a paragon of “little body, big mana,” a trope seen elsewhere in Hawaiian lore (cf. Māui, Kaulu). This valorization of potency in miniature, both physical and familial, functions as a rhetorical device that inverts normative power structures—not merely reflecting a belief in divine ancestry (as emphasized in his genealogy: son of the part-divine, chiefly Kauluakaha‘i, and the mortal Pōka‘ī), but also subverting the authority of established social and ritual protocols.

The theme of alienation and social marginality is foregrounded through the abandonment of Pōka‘ī by Kauluakaha‘i after conception, and the resultant poverty endured by mother and child. This motif is further complicated by the sexual assertiveness of Puali‘i and the vulnerability of Pōka‘ī, whose “ruined body” is depicted with frank corporeality—arguably a narrative strategy reflecting both patriarchal anxieties around female agency and the fragility of maternal figures in mo‘olelo.

Acts of transgression and ritual violation pervade the story. Puali‘i’s strict vow concerning the ulua head and sweet potatoes, a clear reference to the ‘ai kapu (sacred eating restrictions), is juxtaposed with Nāmakaokapāo‘o's outright disregard for the protocol in harvesting and roasting sweet potatoes, preempting the ceremonial noa ritual. The subsequent violence—the attempted child sacrifice—becomes a caesura wherein the existing social order is literally and symbolically overturned. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s victory through what appears as supernatural intervention (deflection of the ko‘ilipi, causing Puali‘i’s self-beheading) elevates him as the agent of divine justice, one who destroys both paternal tyranny and ritualistic violence.

The motif of the orphan, who overcomes existential threat and dispossession, functions allegorically as the elevation of the disenfranchised—an inversion with possible political resonance in the context of colonial subjugation and resistance.

**2. Historical and Cultural Context**

The chapter is suffused with language and mental frameworks rooted in kapu-era society, yet its narrative choices and elaborations suggest a post-1819, and even post-1893, sensibility. References to ‘ai kapu ritual practice, the focus on food taboos, and the hierarchy of chiefs are explicitly foregrounded, offering a window onto both the structure and anxieties of traditional Hawaiian society. However, the rupture of those protocols—Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s direct violation of food restrictions, the unilateral assertion of agency by a child, and the disempowerment (even demonization) of established masculine figures—reflects a narrative renegotiation consistent with late-nineteenth and early twentieth-century Hawaiian publications.

As archival records show, serialized versions of this account emerged in the Hawaiian-language press during and after the decline of the Hawaiian monarchy, at a time of profound social upheaval following the 1893 overthrow of Queen Liliʻuokalani. The conscious evocation of the kapu system, tinged with negativity or ambivalence, may reflect a retrospective critique shaped by ascendancy of Christian and Western values, as well as a rhetorical effort to “justify” the replacement of traditional Hawaiian authority with colonial rule by casting pre-Christian society as violent, chaotic, and ultimately self-undermining.

The connection of sweet potato patches with specific named locales, and their genuine existence in the recent memory of the text’s audience, operates as a device to historicize the story and anchor it in a recognizable, even nostalgic, landscape. Yet this also signals a rhetorical strategy common in allegorical tales composed or remodelled in the late nineteenth century: grounding critique of the past in concrete localities while signaling to a contemporary audience the moral and political lessons to be drawn.

**3. Significance in Hawaiian Literature and Cultural Analysis**

Beyond its narrative content, Chapter 1 functions as a palimpsest of Hawaiian oral tradition and transforming cultural identities. On its surface, it perpetuates the literary heritage of mo‘olelo that place extraordinary children at the center of Hawiian socio-political transformation. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s exploits echo the mythopoeic idiom wherein the singular actions of a divine child remake the world—ultimately reshaping the social landscape (“all of O‘ahu became subject to Nāmakaokapāo‘o”).

Yet the conspicuous absence of agentive female characters (apart from the suffering and ultimately passive Pōka‘ī), the villainization—or humiliation—of indigenous male figures (as depicted in the fatal incompetence and ultimate defeat of Puali‘i and ʻAmaʻu), and the implicit disparagement of the pre-Christian ritual order, all function as literary symptoms of an era marked by aggressive reordering of Hawaiian society along Western and colonial lines. The repeated depiction of male violence and the absence of creative female leadership may be interpreted as both a lament and a critique—possibly unintended—of the fractures produced by colonialism and missionary influence.

Importantly, the composition and serial publication of these stories in the Hawaiian language newspapers situate them at the intersection of indigenous narrative continuity and externally imposed cultural reformation. While the heroic agency of Nāmakaokapāo‘o can be read as resistance to illegitimate authority, the ultimate domestication of his power (redistributing land to his mother, restoring a measure of dignity to the previously dispossessed) also mirrors the anxieties and hopes of a people forced to renegotiate their sovereignty and cultural identity after the trauma of the illegal overthrow.

**4. Synthesis of Narrative Passages**

Each successive passage in the chapter builds upon the previous, constructing a cumulative portrait of an extraordinary, if socially peripheral, figure whose actions fundamentally destabilize and reconstitute the sociopolitical status quo. The genealogical invocation situates Nāmakaokapāo‘o within a sacred, chiefly, and cosmologically significant lineage. The broken parental and communal structures (father’s abandonment, mother’s vulnerability, stepfather's violence) construct a landscape of existential precarity and moral ambiguity, setting the stage for the child’s emergence as hero.

His serial confrontations—with familial violence (Puali‘i), state violence (‘Ama‘u and his armies), and ritual restrictions (food taboos)—map onto a journey of self-assertion and social reformation. The invocation of divine ancestors in his death chant, the miraculous defeat of aggressors, and the installation of his mother as ruler all bear the hallmarks of a mythic cycle intended to simultaneously entertain, edify, and warn, while articulating a vision of power born from struggle, rupture, and the creative adaptation of tradition.

**5. Temporal Context and Political Implications**

Conceived and circulated in the wake of seismic political change (the 1893 overthrow and subsequent annexation politics), this chapter must be read as part of a broader attempt to negotiate—if not rationalize—the ascendancy of Western and American modes of governance and morality in Hawai‘i. The unflattering depiction of the kapu system and its custodians, the centrality of violence in restoring order, and the rhetoric of the underdog overcoming oppressive and “backward” forces all echo the discursive strategies of colonial narratives that justified the supplanting of Hawaiian self-rule with foreign authority.

At the same time, the endurance of the Nāmakaokapāo‘o figure in the Hawaiian language press and oral tradition suggests a persistent longing for indigenous agency, for the possibility that even the smallest, most marginalized actors might remake the world in the face of overwhelming odds. Indeed, this ambiguity—between capitulation to colonial narratives and recalibration of indigenous heroism—constitutes the abiding legacy and scholarly interest of this chapter, and marks it as both a cautionary tale and testament to the complexity of Hawaiian cultural survival."

When Pōka‘ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, and Pōka‘ī remained, pregnant, and later gave birth. With this birth, Pōka‘ī and her child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, became very poor.","**Paragraph 2: Setting, Conception, and the Single-Mother Motif**

• **Geographical and Social Context:**  
  – The narrative specifies *Hō‘ae‘ae* in *‘Ewa* (a district on the island of O‘ahu) as the land where the union took place. In Hawaiian storytelling, it is customary to firmly anchor the action in a specific *wāhi* (place), emphasizing that land and genealogy are intertwined. *Hō‘ae‘ae* itself is a wetland region historically noted for its fertility and abundance, suggesting complex undertones of creation and continuity.

• **The Union and Conception:**  
  – The phrase ""launa kino ai me ka moe‘ana iho"" refers delicately but explicitly to sexual union (*launa kino*: physical intimacy; *moe‘ana*: sleeping together), an important narrative device marking the conception of an ali‘i (chiefly) child. This explicit but respectful reference aligns with traditional Hawaiian storytelling, where the circumstances of a child's conception—specifically site, season, and genealogy—profoundly determine the child's *mana* (spiritual power) and place in society.

• **Genealogical Separation and Gender Dynamics:**  
  – Upon learning of Pōka‘ī’s pregnancy, Kauluakaha‘i departs for ""kona ‘āina"" (“his land”), leaving Pōka‘ī to dwell alone with her pregnancy. This pattern—where an outside or chiefly lover (often of semi-divine status, as Kauluakaha‘i is described) disappears after the union—occurs frequently in mo‘olelo (traditional narratives). It is reflective both of migratory chiefly practices, where ali‘i might travel and leave behind offspring, and of allegorical connections to gods or ancestors who traverse realms.  
  – In practical terms, Pōka‘ī is left as a single mother, a motif that recurs throughout Hawaiian literature and is especially poignant in times of political or inter-island tumult. Her parenting alone signals both vulnerability and a test of resilience.

• **The 'Ilihune Theme: Poverty and Social Standing:**  
  – The closing sentence, ""he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki,"" declares their great poverty after birth. *‘Ili-hune* (lit., “skin-poor”) suggests not just material poverty but a state of social isolation or ostracization, commonly associated with women who bear ali‘i children out of wedlock or whose chiefly partners depart.  
  – This theme reflects the social structures of the ‘Ai Kapu era, where lineage and support networks determined individual status. Without Kauluakaha‘i’s continued presence and support, Pōka‘ī’s and Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s standing plummets.  
  – Allegorically, the child (Nāmakaokapāo‘o) born in poverty but of chiefly and possibly divine descent foreshadows a “hidden” or “humble” origin later yielding greatness—a classic structure in Polynesian epic birth narratives (see: Pukui, Haole, ""Hawaiian Genealogies""; Kame‘eleihiwa, ""Native Land and Foreign Desires"").

• **Names and Their Meanings:**  
  – *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (“The eyes of the pāo‘o fish”): Already, the name implies depth, perhaps a connection to insight or perseverance, alluding to his future role. The obscurity and humility of his beginnings contrast with latent potential.  
  – *Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i* (“The inspiration of Kaha‘i” or “the growth caused by Kaha‘i”): His swift return to his homeland emphasizes the transient, almost mythic role of the procreative male in many Hawaiian cosmogonies.  
  – *Pō-ka‘ī* (“Night falls upon…,” or possibly “the darkness of the chief”): The maternal line is left with the burden of nurturing and raising a child in hardship, a common device to highlight endurance and maternal fortitude.

• **Cultural and Allegorical Layers:**  
  – The motif of the “abandoned mother and extraordinary child” can be interpreted as a metaphor for the Hawaiian people’s relationship with their akua (gods/ancestors) and chiefly lines: periodic absences or losses test the strength of the land and its people, often resulting in hidden greatness.  
  – The setting in Hō‘ae‘ae, a region of old richness and agricultural significance, now juxtaposed with the “poverty” of Pōka‘ī and her son, mirrors the loss of abundance following the breakdown of chiefly support—a harbinger of change in social and spiritual order.

In summary, this paragraph serves as a transition from genealogical preparation to the central themes of struggle, resilience, and hidden nobility—pervasive structures in Hawaiian oral tradition. It positions Pōka‘ī as a figure of hardship and perseverance, and establishes Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a child with humble beginnings, who is nevertheless destined for remarkable deeds due to his chiefly, even divine, parentage.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p3,1,3,"Iā lāua e noho ana, iho maila ‘o Puali‘i, he  kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e, i ka lawai‘a ma kai o  Honouliuli, kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka‘ī.

Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and desired her, and he said, “I want you as my woman.” Pōka‘ī replied, “How could you want me? I have borne a child, and my body is ruined.” Puali‘i responded, “That does not matter—if you want me, let us sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed, and so she went with her man, with Puali‘i, to the plains of Keahumoa, to live.","• This passage marks a turning point in the narrative dynamics and domestic life of Pōka‘ī following the birth of her child with her previous partner, introducing significant social and interpersonal negotiations of status, gender, and bodily value. The detail and dialog reveal multiple layers of cultural practice during the traditional Hawaiian era.

• **Character Introduction and Place Naming:**
   – A new male figure enters the narrative: Pua-li‘i (Pua: child/descendant, li‘i: chiefly). His name suggests possible chiefly rank or descent, although his adscription as “he kanaka maika‘i” (“a good man”) foregrounds his personal character over his ancestry. Such introductory markers are a literary convention in Hawaiian mo‘olelo (stories), situating the character through actions, origins, and nature.
   – Līhu‘e (precise identification debated on O‘ahu or Kaua‘i in this context) and the shoreline of Honouliuli (‘Ewa District, O‘ahu) are specified, invoking a sense of regional movement and reinforcing the mobility that was common in Hawaiian society, where land and sea travel were routine and intimately interconnected with sustenance activities like fishing.

• **Hospitality and Custom:**
   – Puali‘i’s visitation to the home of Pōka‘ī aligns with broader Hawaiian customs of aloha and hospitality. Within the ‘Ai Kapu era (a period governed by strict social and religious kapu, or sacred law), it was normative protocol to accept guests and offer food, water, and shelter, irrespective of prior acquaintance. Refusing such hospitality could incur social disapproval or even supernatural consequences.
   – This open-door custom contextualizes the plausibility of Puali‘i’s bold approach and Pōka‘ī’s receptiveness to his presence.

• **Dialogue and Gendered Discourse:**
   – The dialogue is direct and intimate, revealing shifts in customary forms of courtship that might have occurred within chiefly or commoner contexts. Puali‘i’s plain-spoken desire (“Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u”) demonstrates the pragmatic as well as emotional nature of such proposals, where marriage or partnership may be negotiated swiftly and with few intermediaries.
   – Pōka‘ī’s self-deprecation (“Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino”—“I have borne a child and my body is ruined”) reflects not only personal vulnerability but social realities about female worth being tied to bodily “intactness.” Concerns with post-partum body image are recorded elsewhere in Hawaiian oral tradition, though they may also indicate the lasting power of kapu-era beliefs regarding purity and eligibility for remarriage.
       • Her comment may also gesture toward deeper anxieties of kapu violations; in some periods, women who had borne children and were not currently married might risk marginality within their communities.

   – Puali‘i’s reply rejects this stigma (“He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua”—“It does not matter, if you want me, let us sleep together”), affirming the primacy of mutual desire over restrictive bodily ideals or social taboos, at least in this domestic situation. Such candor further highlights the range of possible responses to kapu conventions and evolving gender roles.

• **Relocation and Founding of a New Household:**
   – Their move to “ke kula o Keahumoa” (the plains of Keahumoa) represents the formalization of their relationship through new geographical and domestic settlement. “Keahu-moa” (Heap of chickens, though possibly “heap” in general—symbolically linked to abundance or newly founded productivity) underscores the theme of fertility and starting anew.
       • In Hawaiian traditions, founding a new household and a change of residence (especially to the man’s home region) was a traditional act of union, akin to “marriage” by cohabitation and mutual acknowledgment.

• **Allegorical and Socio-Historical Readings:**
   – Allegorically, this passage may be read as a commentary on the possibility for renewal and second chances for women who, due to life events (childbirth, widowhood, or abandonment), were often judged by broader social standards.
       • Puali‘i’s attitude exemplifies aloha and acceptance, an idealized masculine response standing in contrast to kapu-era judgments.
   – The episode further articulates the porous boundaries between individual agency and social expectation, with Pōka‘ī’s hesitation overcome by reassurance, and a new familial unit established through mutual choice.

• **Summary:**
   – This passage encapsulates key features of Hawaiian mo‘olelo: movement across the landscape, introduction and refinement of relationships, and the negotiation of social status and bodily value. The household formed by Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i—founded in the heart of Keahumoa—stands as a testament to the resilience and dynamic adaptation of human relationships within the fabric of traditional Hawaiian society.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

When the sweet potatoes matured, Puali‘i stated his solemn vow: “When the head of the ulua fish is baked together with the sweet potatoes and Puali‘i eats, then it will be free (noa)—then his wife, Pōka‘ī, and others may eat as well.” Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for something to eat with the sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**
• This passage situates the family of Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī in a phase of settled agricultural life, a classic motif in Hawaiian mo‘olelo that denotes both industriousness and rootedness in land (mālama ‘āina). The explicit mention of “mahi ‘ai” (to cultivate food) highlights subsistence living and the centrality of ‘uala (sweet potato) as a staple crop in traditional Hawaiian society.   
&nbsp;– The narrative credits Puali‘i with owning and tending to two “māla ‘uala lō‘ihi” (“long sweet potato patches”), which he has maintained up to the present (“ā hiki i kēia lā”). Place names being preserved in perpetuity is a recurring feature of Hawaiian oral tradition; it both anchors legendary figures in the landscape and acts as a form of cultural cartography.  
&nbsp;– The naming of patches as “Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (the name of their son/child) is significant. “Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o” can be broken down as “the eyes of the pāo‘o (goby) fish,” referencing either the child himself or the emblematic power of naming land and its produce after familial or legendary figures. This process immortalizes individuals and stories in the geography (see Pukui’s discussions of inoa ‘āina, place names as cultural memory).  

• The maturation of the ‘uala (the sweet potatoes ripened: “o‘o ka ‘uala”) sets the stage for ritualized consumption, governed by the strictures of the ‘Ai Kapu system, a gendered food taboo system central to pre-contact Hawaiian life.  
&nbsp;– Puali‘i’s pronouncement (“‘ōlelo ho‘ohiki,” a vow or oath) is explicit: not until the ulua’s (giant trevally) head is baked with the ‘uala, and he (Puali‘i) eats, will the food become “noa”—free of religious restriction—and thus be edible by his wife Pōka‘ī and other (presumably women and children, “nā mea ‘ē a‘e”).   
&nbsp;– The ulua (Caranx ignobilis) holds ritual significance. Its head is specially mentioned because in ‘Ai Kapu meal structure, certain prized parts of certain animals or fish—such as the head—were traditionally reserved for males of chiefly or priestly status, reinforced through food prohibitions. Thus, the meal is not merely a matter of sustenance, but dense with social and religious meaning.

• The phrase “noa” denotes the state of being ritually free from kapu (taboo). In the ‘Ai Kapu system, particular foods and certain eating times or circumstances were forbidden (kapu) until specific rites were performed—often culminating in a man eating first, then declaring the food “noa,” thereby releasing it for women and others. This underscores the gendered stratification and sacred ordering of everyday life:  
&nbsp;– The declaration of “noa” through food consumption is a performative act, one that transforms the environment from sacred-restricted (kapu) to common-permitted (noa). This practice projects male authority and ritual power into the domestic sphere.

• The practical outcome of this kapu: Puali‘i “iho akula i kai o Honouliuli e lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala” (descended to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for something to eat with the sweet potatoes).  
&nbsp;– Honouliuli (lit. “dark bay” or “dark slip of land”) is a well-known ahupua‘a on O‘ahu, rich in coastal resources. The act of going “i kai” (down to the sea) for “i‘a ‘ai pū” (fish to eat together with ‘uala) reflects the essential pairing of kula (fields) and kai (sea) in Hawaiian subsistence: a balanced diet and a worldview that sees land and ocean as spiritually and practically interconnected.  
&nbsp;– Puali‘i’s agency in seeking out fish himself further underlines the values of industriousness and self-sufficiency (as opposed to chiefly privilege, which might expect retainers to do the work), signaling either his social status or a narrative motif of humility.

• Allegorically, this passage also encodes a broader commentary on custom and order:  
&nbsp;– The ritualization of eating, the gender and taboo boundaries, and the repetitive performance of cultivating, harvesting, and communal sharing all emphasize the cyclical, regulated, and deeply sacralized mode of traditional Hawaiian existence.  
&nbsp;– References to vows (“‘ōlelo ho‘ohiki”) and the naming of land after prominent individuals or events also serve as mnemonic devices, reminding descendants and listeners of the foundational actions and values of their ancestors. 

• In summary, this paragraph operates on multiple levels: as a literal episode depicting subsistence labor and domestic order, as an index of ‘Ai Kapu religious practice, as a function of toponymic memory, and as an allegory for the cycles of work, restriction, release, and the sanctification of daily acts in Hawaiian culture.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s body at that time was very small, just two and a half feet tall; his genitals were not yet secured, still dangling. When they arrived at the sweet potato field, he commanded the children, “Pull up all the sweet potato mounds and leaves, bring them all up, don’t leave any still growing.” However, those children were afraid, so they gently restrained themselves with the sweet potatoes and did not pull up a single mound.","• **Plot Development and Characterization:**  
  – This paragraph establishes a scene where Pua-li‘i, presumably stepfather or guardian of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, departs to fish. His absence provides opportunity for Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o to exert influence over other children and target Pua-li‘i’s cultivated lands.  
  – The gathering of seventeen children (he ‘umi kumamāhiku: “ten and seven,” i.e., seventeen) in the narrative amplifies Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s social influence, suggesting leadership, charisma, or mischievous authority, a common trope in tales of trickster or demigod children.

• **Physical Description and Age:**  
  – Explicit attention is paid to the protagonist’s physique: a body “very small” and “two and a half feet tall,” with an underdeveloped (“not secured”) and “dangling” ma‘i (genitals), implying a prepubescent or infantile state.  
  – Hawaiian mo‘olelo (traditional narratives) often describe the inauspicious or unusual physical traits of supernatural or extraordinary children, highlighting either their divine descent, their otherworldly mana (spiritual power), or their potential for disruption.  
  – The reference to the “not yet secured” genitals is a culturally significant indicator of immaturity and vulnerability, but might also be a metaphor for a yet-unformed identity or destiny.

• **Social and Moral Dynamics:**  
  – Upon arrival at the field, Nāmakaokapāo‘o gives a direct and destructive order: to pull up (“huhuki”) all the sweet potato mounds (“pu‘e”) and leaves, leaving nothing to continue growing.  
  – The imperative not to spare “any still growing” speaks to an impulse for totality, hyperbole, or recklessness, qualities often associated with both childlike immaturity and the wild, disruptive force of demi-gods in Hawaiian thought.  
  – The other children’s response—fear and gentle restraint—reflects both social hierarchy (respect for authority, even from a peer) and the inculcation of value for resources. Their reluctance to destroy the ‘uala (sweet potato) is a conservative, perhaps community-taught, response rooted in subsistence agriculture: the ‘uala was a critical crop, and wanton destruction would be unthinkable outside of a symbolic or highly charged context.

• **Agricultural and Ritual Implications:**  
  – Sweet potato fields (māla ‘uala) were indicators of wealth, status, and sustenance, and the act of pulling up entire mounds is symbolic of both abundance and vulnerability, as their destruction threatens family and community stability.  
  – In ritual settings, such destruction could be interpreted as a reenactment of sacrificial or offering practices, or as metaphor for transition, renewal, or even rebellion against social order.

• **Allegorical Interpretations:**  
  – The interplay between the “little” but commanding Nāmakaokapāo‘o and the “fearful” majority suggests an allegory about power and the potential for even the most seemingly insignificant individuals to incite major disruption.  
  – The explicit contrast between order (agricultural cultivation and restraint) and chaos (destruction, impulsivity) alludes to wider cultural tensions, especially within the ‘Ai Kapu and post-‘Ai Kapu eras, concerning authority, resource management, and the consequences of violating kapu (sacred laws/taboos).  
  – The representation of the child’s unchecked desires and the restraint of the group may comment on the importance of socialized behavior in maintaining communal well-being.

• **Onomastics and Etymology:**  
  – The number “seventeen” recalls frequent use of specific numbers in Hawaiian tradition to signify completeness, excess, or supernatural agency (cf. “kanahā” [forty] in prior passages, often symbolic or hyperbolic).  
  – Name analysis: Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (“the eyes of the pāo‘o fish”) frames the protagonist as one who sees what others do not, perhaps foreshadowing insight, prescience, or a disruptive vantage.

• **Comparative Motifs in Hawaiian Storytelling:**  
  – Stories regularly use child protagonists who behave in outsized or precocious ways to dramatize lessons about growth, respect, and restraint, with the child’s impulsiveness contrasted against the measured, deferential actions of the group.  
  – These motifs parallel those found in the stories of Māui and other kupua (demigods), who challenge social and cosmic order.

• **Conclusion:**  
  – This paragraph reflects a snapshot of tension between youthful impulsivity and collective conservatism, rife with layered meaning about authority, cultural norms surrounding agriculture and kapu, and the unpredictable power of those who appear weak or young but act forcefully. In classic Hawaiian storytelling, such scenes invite the audience to consider the consequences of surrendering to, or resisting, the disruptive energy of the exceptional child.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire, roasting four sweet potato vines on the blazing hearth. While he was roasting them over the fire, his stepfather arrived at last, and asked his mother, Pōka‘ī, a question, to which she replied, “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes: his head and eyes will be the relish for my sweet potatoes today. Therefore, today is the day he dies at my hands.”","• **Destructive Action & its Allegorical Context:**  
  – The passage opens with Nāmakaokapāo‘o engaged in a relentless uprooting (“huhuki”) of two entire sweet potato (*‘uala*) patches. This degree of destruction—explicitly detailed as “he kanahā āhua” (forty mounds of sweet potato leaves)—invites interpretation beyond mere childish mischief. The act is methodical, not random: the complete stripping of resources points to themes of depletion, perhaps even wastefulness, and the disruption of familial or communal sustenance.
  – In traditional Hawaiian society, sweet potatoes were a staple crop, essential to everyday survival, especially in resource-poor environments or on outer islands such as Ni‘ihau. A child’s destruction of food sources is a grave violation of communal trust and resource management practices; symbolically, it can also signify a rupture in orderly society and a challenge to established authority or protocol.

• **Ritual Hearth, Number Symbolism, and 'Ai Kapu Allusion:**  
  – After his act, Nāmakaokapāo‘o kindles a fire (“hō‘ā i ke ahi”) and roasts (“‘ōhinu”) four vines (“‘ehā ‘au”) on the hearth. The text gives deliberate numerical details: two patches, four vines, forty mounds. The numbers themselves may function as a riddle or mnemonic device, but also hint at deeper layers of meaning:
      * ""Kānahā"" (forty) in the traditional counting system often signals completeness or the totality of something large, while “‘ehā” (four) carries cosmic and directional associations (the four cardinal points).
      * The action of broiling vine cuttings ('au), rather than the tuber itself, is especially noteworthy—vine cuttings (maka) are used for propagation, so destroying and roasting them eradicates both the present and future food sources (a metaphor for breaking generational continuity or interrupting the ‘āina's cycle).
      * The kapuahi (“hearth”) had ritual significance in Hawaiian homes, serving as the locus for cooking, family gatherings, and sometimes minor ceremonies; thus, Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s actions at the fire may allude to profaning or inverting ritual order.

• **Arrival of the Stepfather and ‘Ai Kapu Inversion:**  
  – The stepfather, Puali‘i, returns and, after inquiry of Pōka‘ī, pronounces a chilling intent: to use the head (“po‘o”) and eyes (“maka”) of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as “‘īna‘i” (relish) for his sweet potato meal, and declares this as the boy’s day to die.
      * The phrase “‘īna‘i ai ku‘u ‘uala” refers to the customary eating of a staple (such as sweet potato or poi) with a tasty side dish (often fish or other savory food). Here, Puali‘i substitutes the child’s head and eyes, a shocking reversal.
      * In the context of ‘Ai Kapu (the sacred eating prohibition system), the head of the ulua (trevally) fish, or the head of a human, was sometimes reserved for high chiefs or used in ritual contexts—including sacrifice. Puali‘i’s statement is an inversion of the substitution practiced under ‘Ai Kapu: where a fish (ulua) might be sacrificed or used as ritual food instead of a human, here the human child becomes the substitute for fish, signaling both the gravity of the offense and an escalation of ritual threat to violence.
      * The wordplay on “maka” (eye, bud, or cutting) is significant here: not only does it refer to Nāmakaokapāo‘o's name (“The eyes of the pāo‘o fish”), but also to the life-giving vine cuttings that are being destroyed, thus entwining personal identity, agricultural cycle, and the perpetuation of lineage.

• **Allegorical and Social Implications:**  
  – The passage ultimately explores themes of generational conflict, transition, and the collapse and replacement of ritual systems. Nāmakaokapāo‘o, through wanton destruction but also innovation, challenges the order represented by Puali‘i, a figure explicitly identified with the old authority and ‘Ai Kapu customs.
      * Puali‘i’s resort to violence (“eia kona lā e make ai ia‘u”—today is his day to die at my hands) can be read as the entrenchment of Kapu logic: a system that finds resolution through threat, punishment, and sacrificial violence when order is breached.
      * Yet, in Hawaiian myth and mo‘olelo, such moments often presage transformation. The old must be threatened, even destroyed, for a new order or knowledge (‘ike) to emerge, frequently mediated by the kupuna (ancestors) or the young protagonist endowed with special power or insight.

• **Summary Statement:**  
  – Thus, this passage is rich with encoded cultural and symbolic meaning. On the surface, it is a family conflict over the destruction of crops. At a deeper level, it operates as a metaphor for the tension between old and new, security and innovation, and the continual negotiation of power, resource, and ritual within Hawaiian society. The careful use of names, numbers, and food customs grounds this narrative in the historical realities of the ‘Ai Kapu era and the broader themes of Hawaiian cosmology and social order.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw what was happening, and they ran and stood far off because they were afraid of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! Here is the ko‘ilipi in my hand, something to sever your head with today—when your head is cut off, then it will be cooked and eaten with the sweet potato, and I will eat first, and then it will be noa (free/unrestricted).” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no attention to these words of Puali‘i, so Puali‘i spoke again, a second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the ko‘ilipi, but then Nāmakaokapāo‘o began to recite his death prayer against Puali‘i. The prayer went as follows:

Cherished indeed are the eyes of my little pāo‘o,
Now scorched, now blackened,
Perhaps to be eaten, or perhaps left aside,
Perhaps left as Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,
That one is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,
This is my companion,
Nāmakaokai‘a is the high chief of Hawai‘i,
Let the greedy hands slip away,
Those are men with spears,
The spears with the drums,
Death comes to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","**Paragraph 7 Analysis:**

• **Escalation of Conflict and Ritualized Violence:**
  – Puali‘i, whose name suggests ""descendant of chiefs, of chiefly line,"" now takes a **ko‘ilipi**, a weapon-defining this as a moment of potential ritual violence. The ko‘ilipi itself is a culturally loaded term: it refers to a serrated adze or club historically used in sacrifices or executions, and as a tool for decapitation, symbolizes life and death authority, typically wielded by those in power or during decisive ritual acts.
  – The narrative here intensifies the tension introduced in earlier passages: after Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s previous destruction of the sweet potato patches and the symbolic threat against his body (his ""head and eyes"" as food), Puali‘i now prepares to actually carry out this punishment within the presence of witnesses (the other children), who flee in fear. This reflects both the seriousness of the social order threatened and the dangers inherent in the traditional household, especially under the ancient **‘Ai Kapu** system.

• **Public Spectacle and Social Order:**
  – The children’s fear and retreat to a distance underscore the public nature of punishment and its didactic intent. Such spectacles were part of ancient *kānāwai* (law/codes) enforcement, meant to serve as lessons to the entire community regarding the consequences of taboo-breaking or destruction of valuable resources (here, the *‘uala*).

• **The Pronouncement of Kapu (Taboo) and Noa (Release):**
  – Puali‘i’s lines: ""when your head is cut off, then it will be cooked and eaten with the sweet potato, and I will eat first, and then it will be noa,"" encapsulate a core logic within Hawaiian ritual practice:
      • The act of consuming the sacrificed (human or substituted offering) is a transition between *kapu* (sacred restriction, danger, power, ritual possession) and *noa* (release, everyday, ordinary). Only after the correct sequence of violence and ritual consumption can normalcy return.
      • The focus on ""I will eat first"" is significant: in ritual meals, rank determines eating order—chiefs, priests, or sacrificers consume first, cementing the social hierarchy. Eating ""first"" is an assertion of Puali‘i's authority in the household or over the victim.

• **Refusal and Invocation of Spiritual Power:**
  – Despite this threat, Nāmakaokapāo‘o does not respond or obey. Instead, he composes and utters a *pule make* (death prayer, imprecatory chant), a type of composition believed to call upon spiritual forces to turn or mitigate the fate imposed by others. Such prayers are used throughout Hawaiian oral tradition, often to call down curses or protection.
      – By reciting a death prayer **against** Puali‘i, Nāmakaokapāo‘o invokes the cosmological and genealogical dimensions of protection; to speak one's prayer is to summon ancestral mana to intercede.

• **Breakdown and Analysis of the Pule:**
  – ""Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o"" / ""Cherished indeed are the eyes of my little pāo‘o"": Refers both to the physical eyes of Nāmakaokapāo‘o and to the *maka* (sprout, eye, origin) of the sweet potato (the crop he was tending/cooking). The word *pāo‘o* is ambiguous but often refers to a species of goby fish or, poetically, to the ""head"" (as in ""nā maka o ka pāo‘o""—the eyes of the pāo‘o fish/head), linking the sacrificial motif of body and food.
      – ""E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei"" / ""Now scorched, now blackened"": Describes sweet potatoes being roasted, but also refers to his own possible fate (""to be burnt, charred""), linking body and food in the sacrificial economy.
      – ""E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha"" / ""Perhaps to be eaten, or perhaps left aside"": Balances the uncertainty of fate; in sacrifice, not everything is consumed—some is saved for the gods (left on the *lele*, altar), some returned to the people.
      – ""E waiho paha Nākukui‘aimakaokalani"" (""perhaps left as Nākukui‘aimakaokalani""), ""‘O Kukui‘aimakaokalani kēlā"" (""That one is Kukui‘aimakaokalani""): 
          • *Nākukui‘aimakaokalani* and *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* appear to be personal or ancestral names/titles, possibly of protective or guardian spirits. *Kukui*, the candlenut, is symbolic of light, enlightenment, genealogy, or even eyes (the glistening of kukui as eyes). *Aima ka o ka lani* (""tears/eyes of the heavens"") references celestial or ancestor-given sight/protection. The naming here wraps Nāmakaokapāo‘o in a web of spiritual relationships.
          • Alternatively, they could be literal relatives or allies to whom the prayer is directed for assistance.
      – ""‘O ku‘u wahi aikāne kēia"" / ""This is my companion"": *Aikāne* were intimate companions, often with strong spiritual, political, or sexual connotations. Invoking an *aikāne* ties the speaker to a peer network of loyalty—a potential spiritual or otherworldly helper.
      – ""‘O Nāmakaokai‘a ke ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i"" / ""Nāmakaokai‘a is the high chief of Hawai‘i"": This may be self-referential (claiming the title of high chief), or perhaps referring to another powerful ancestor/spiritual protector. The name Nāmakaokai‘a (""the eyes of the fish"") speaks to the surveillance, watchfulness, and protection of the ali‘i nui (supreme chief).
      – ""E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale"" / ""Let the greedy hands slip away"": *He‘e* (to slip, to escape, to slide) here is both an imperative and wish: ""let escape happen,"" let the hands (of violence) slip away empty, or let the killer be unable to grasp his victim.
      – ""‘O kānaka nō me ka ihe, ‘O ka ihe nō me ka pahu"": ""Those are men with spears, The spears with the drums"": A poetic description of warriors and the presence of ritual objects (spears, drums)—possibly acknowledging the inevitability of violence or situating it within the context of battle and sacrifice, but also repeating known tropes from chanted genealogies and histories.
      – ""Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" / ""Death comes to Nāmakaokapāo‘o"": A closing line that can be read either as resignation to fate or as a hex upon the one who would cause his death—which in some context would reflect back upon the would-be killer.

• **Allegorical and Esoteric Layering:**
  – This passage is deeply allegorical, enacting the tension between old and new systems of authority—especially *kānāwai* and *‘Ai Kapu* (the sacred eating order and restrictions). Puali‘i's insistence on ritual consumption links him to the older, more rigid kapu order—he embodies the punitive and hierarchical past. Nāmakaokapāo‘o, by contrast, wields spiritual resistance and genealogy—his pule asserts an alternative source of power, rooted in prayer, kinship, and spiritual invocation rather than brute force.
  – The use of the pule at the moment of crisis is characteristic of many tales involving ali‘i or demigods in Hawaiian mythology: a supernatural intervention flips the balance of power, often saving the hero or cursing the aggressor.
  – There is also a strong symbolic identification between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and the sweet potato (*‘uala*) as staple food, person and crop being potentially sacrificed, eaten, or spared. The repeated references to *eyes* (*maka*) and *head* (*po‘o*) both literalize and spiritualize the threat, echoing naming patterns (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o) and suggesting the hero stands as symbolic representative of the people (the maka‘āinana, ""eyes of the land,"" the commoners).

• **Conclusion:**
  – This episode crystallizes several themes in Hawaiian narrative tradition: the use of public ritual violence to maintain order; the countervailing power of prayer, kinship, and genealogy; the transformations enacted at moments of crisis; and the ways in which bodily sacrifice, food, and cosmology are interwoven. The shift from violence to prayer heralds potential transformation—either in the logic of tradition, the fate of the participants, or both.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Here, let us speak briefly about those two names, that is, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a; they were both great chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani was the father, and Nāmakaokai‘a the son; however, they became part of the prayer/chants of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","**Paragraph 8:**

• The passage functions as an aside or parenthetical clarification, a common narrative device in Hawaiian mo‘olelo, where the storyteller pauses to trace connections and clarify genealogy or ritual context for the audience. This both grounds the events in lineal history and foregrounds the importance of names in Hawaiian cultural memory.

• The two names detailed—Nā-maka-o-ka-lani and Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a—are constructed in an interpretive formula common for nobility:
   – *Nā-maka-o-ka-lani*: ""The eyes of the heavens,"" where ""maka"" is ""eye"" or ""face,"" ""o"" is ""of,"" and ""ka lani"" means ""the chief/heaven/sky."" In chiefly context, ""lani"" emphasizes divinity, royalty, or exalted status; thus, the name connotes a person of high rank whose vision or presence encompasses both the divine and chiefly spheres.
   – *Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a*: ""The eyes of the fish,"" a construction that, like other “Nā-maka-o-” names, may refer either to genealogical symbolism (descendants whose sight or mana is characterized by the fish) or to attributes associated with the elements (aquatic wisdom, livelihood, or transformation).

• The text situates both figures as *ali‘i nui*—high chiefs—of Hawai‘i (referring here to the island of Hawai‘i, not the archipelago), which is important for both genealogical validation and regional identification. The dichotomy of “father” and “son” reflects a recurring motif in Hawaiian genealogy (mo‘okū‘auhau) and oral literature: the passing of mana, status, and sometimes divine affiliation through generations.

• The statement, ""ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o,"" may be interpreted as:
   – **Literal meaning**: ""They entered into the prayer/chants of Nāmakaokapāo‘o."" In traditional contexts, to be ""part of the prayer"" often means to be included in genealogical chants (*oli*) or ritual recitations, which is a mechanism for both invoking the presence/mana of ancestors and solidifying social legitimacy.
   – **Allegorical meaning**: The act of incorporating these names into prayer/chant is a symbolic gesture connecting the present (Nāmakaokapāo‘o) with ancestral or deified lineage. It affirms the protagonist’s connection to the high rank, mana, and ancestral knowledge of these archetypal parents, blending both historical and spiritual authority. This is a common device in mo‘olelo to legitimize the actions or destiny of the narrative protagonist.

• Culturally, this parenthetical aside:
   – Establishes the chronicled figures not simply as individuals, but as continuations and embodiments of their genealogical line, underscoring the concept of *hanauna* (generational continuity) and *kuleana* (responsibility) in Hawaiian society.
   – Links the story to the practice of *oli mo‘okū‘auhau* (genealogical chants), which were recited in ritual contexts to affirm identity, status, land tenure, and spiritual connections. These chants often enumerate ancestors going back to the gods, situating contemporary actors in a sacred genealogy.
   – The incorporation of names into ""pule"" (prayer) also reflects the porous boundary between history and cosmology in Hawaiian traditions: ancestors are not only remembered but ritually activated, and stories function both to instruct and to make present the power of the past.

• In summary, this passage provides a genealogy of names, signposting the protagonist’s spiritual and aristocratic inheritance, and reminding the listener/reader that the mo‘olelo unfolds within a web of sacred relationships, where ritual speech (pule) serves to maintain and renew connections across generations.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p9,1,9,"A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o, i ia wā i  ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o, e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i  iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē.

Puali‘i’s head called out to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Farewell to you, O Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o then seized Puali‘i’s head and threw it into the sea at Waipouli, into a cave along the shore of Honouliuli, the distance being five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**
• **Supernatural Reversal and Ritual Invocation:**
   – This passage centers on a dramatic moment involving ritual action and supernatural intervention. Nāmakaokapāo‘o completes a **pule** (prayer)—an act invoking divine or ancestral aid in a pivotal moment. The completion of a pule in Hawaiian mo‘olelo (narrative) is frequently a threshold for the supernatural, especially in tales involving characters with divine or semi-divine kinolau (bodies/forms).
   – Immediately upon the conclusion of this pule, Puali‘i attempts to dispatch Nāmakaokapāo‘o with a **ko‘ilipi** (adze). The targeted area, ""i luna pono o"" (directly above/on), indicates a lethal strike, but a supernatural turn occurs: “e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i iā Puali‘i”—the sharp edge of the adze turns upon Puali‘i himself. This type of **reverse-strike** echoes a recurring motif in Polynesian literature where a malevolent action is supernaturally redirected upon the perpetrator.
   – This episode reflects concepts of justice and cosmic balance central to Hawaiian and wider Polynesian worldview, especially in the presence of a kapu (restriction/taboo) or following an appropriate pule.

• **Speaking Head Motif and Its Significance:**
   – Once beheaded (“moku ke po‘o”), Puali‘i’s head continues to speak, uttering a farewell: “Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” The motif of the **speaking, severed head** is not unique to this narrative, but appears in other Hawaiian (see: the mo‘olelo of Kamapua‘a and the piglet’s head) and broader Oceanic traditions, suggesting the *mana* (spiritual power) persisting after death, especially for chiefs or those of chiefly (ali‘i) and possibly demi-divine lineage.
   – The invocation of **aloha** in address to the vanquisher is significant. It can represent forgiveness, love, or a fond farewell even in defeat, echoing Hawaiian values of reconciliation, dignity in death, and perhaps the release of personal animosity for the spiritual welfare of the vanquished.

• **Deep Structure and Etymological Analysis:**
   – The adversaries’ names are again pivotal allegorically: **Pua-li‘i** (descendant/offspring of a chief, sometimes interpreted as “child-chief”), whose role as antagonist/step-father is now completed; and **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o** (“the eyes of the pāo‘o fish”), reflecting sharp perception but here extending perhaps to the capacity to redirect fate through spiritual means.
   – The tool, **ko‘ilipi** (a sharp-toothed adze or axe), is traditionally associated with woodcarving and, symbolically, the shaping or ending of things—including genealogies, boundaries, and lives.

• **The Casting of the Head and Place Names:**
   – **Lālau akula ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ke po‘o o Puali‘i a kiola akula i kai o Waipouli…**: After the reversal, Nāmakaokapāo‘o takes the head and throws it into the sea at Waipouli, specifically into an ""ana"" (cave) on the coast of Honouliuli.
      – **Kiola (to cast/throw)** can carry ritual or symbolic significance—casting away danger, spirits, or in this case, severing the connection of the deceased from the living or the land, perhaps to pacify lingering malevolence (akua lapu/spirits).
      – **Waipouli** literally translates as “bewitched water” or ""water of enchantment,"" which in legendary geography often signals a liminal place, a portal between realms (land/sea, living/dead, human/divine). Casting Puali‘i's head into such a cave suggests a return or banishment of spirit to a realm outside the human world, aligned with traditional practices mitigating spiritual retribution or lingering ‘uhane (ghosts).
      – The specified distance (“‘elima mile ka loa”—five miles long) underscores the **epic scale** of the act, as measured distances in Hawaiian tradition often denote not literal geography but the magnitude or sacredness of a deed.

• **Allegorical Resonance and Social Commentary:**
   – The entire episode allegorizes the triumph of spiritual preparation and mana (embodied in Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s pule and righteous cause) over brute force and misused authority (as seen in Puali‘i’s would-be act of violence). Following the themes of mo‘olelo from the late ‘Ai Kapu era, it can symbolize the overturning of an unjust social order or the eventual purification of the familial or communal space.
   – The act of ridding the land of a malevolent figure by supernatural means recalls cleansing rituals (heiau ceremonies) at times of transition—fitting as this paragraph may mark the end of one generation and the empowerment of the next.

• **Summary:**
   – This passage integrates key elements of Hawaiian tradition: ritual prayer, supernatural agency, poetic justice, and the power of place. It demonstrates in literary form how old wounds (family betrayal, step-parent villainy) are resolved within the social and cosmic order, returning harmony to the ‘ohana and the ‘āina (land).","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p10,1,10,"A make ‘o Puali‘i, ho‘i akula ‘o   Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i kona makuahine, iā  Pōka‘ī, noho ihola lāua, ‘a‘ohe ‘ai o   Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ka ‘ai.

At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu here, was living at Waikīkī. A man came from Honouliuli all the way to Waikīkī, where the chief resided. That man said, “O chief! There is an exceptional little boy of great strength. His father has died and his head was cast far out to sea, at a great distance—five miles away.” When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he thought, “If his strength is greater than mine, I will die at his hands; but if not, then he has no strength.” As he was saying this at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words being spoken about him.","**Narrative Context & Thematic Analysis:**

• **Death and Aftermath**  
  – The paragraph opens with the passing of Pua-li‘i (the stepfather). Nāmakaokapāo‘o returns to his biological mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two reside together.  
  – The sentence, “ʻAʻole ʻai ʻo Nāmakaokapāoʻo i ka ʻai,” (Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat food) suggests grief or a period of ritual mourning, an act which can signify emotional distress, ritual kapu, or preparation for a pivotal transformation or challenge within Hawaiian custom. Fasting or refusal of food often precedes spiritual or physical trials in mo‘olelo.

• **Expansion of Setting and Characters**  
  – A new character appears: ‘Ama‘u, identified as an ali‘i (chief) of O‘ahu, residing at Waikīkī.  
  – The arrival of a messenger (kanaka) from Honouliuli (a district in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu) to Waikīkī reflects the inter-district communication practices among ali‘i and the ritual of public announcements or challenges.  
  – The oral report delivered is formulaic in style, with the messenger addressing ‘Ama‘u directly and employing hyperbolic language to introduce the wonder-child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Such oral announcements are a staple of chiefly courts, used to relay feats, provocations, or notable occurrences, sometimes as preludes to contest, alliance, or conflict.

• **Symbolic Action: The Head Cast into the Sea**  
  – The narrativized detail that Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s father's “head was cast far out to sea, at a great distance—five miles away” is both literal and metaphorical.  
  – In Hawaiian poetic and narrative tradition, the casting of a head (po‘o) into the sea evokes several possible readings:
    - **Ancestral offering or sacrifice:** The sea is a conduit to the gods and ancestral realms, making the act an offering or a means of purification.
    - **Exile or removal of mana:** By removing the head (primary seat of mana or spiritual power) far from the land, it symbolically distances the power or threat posed by Pua-li‘i, allowing Nāmakaokapāo‘o to emerge as a successor, unimpeded.
    - **Hyperbolic expression:** The “five miles” emphasizes the superhuman force involved, likely referring to Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prodigious strength and the extraordinary scale of events.

• **Announcement and Challenge: The Chiefly Response**  
  – The response of ‘Ama‘u is both competitive and calculating. He measures the strength of the boy against his own, manifesting the chiefly trait of kua‘ana (rivalrous comparison), a key theme in many mo‘olelo ali‘i:
    - “If his strength is greater than mine, I will die at his hands; if not, he has no strength.” This is a formulaic utterance, conveying both readiness for contest and the closed, zero-sum logic of chiefly prowess (i.e., only the strongest survives or rules).
    – Chiefs were often tested, publicly or through messenger, to establish or reaffirm their mana, authority, and fitness to rule; challenges and reports of marvels would quickly spread via ‘aha‘āina (chiefly gatherings) or through messengers.

• **Nāmakaokapāo‘o Overhears – Motif of the Eavesdropping Hero**  
  – The closing observation, that Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard these words being spoken about him, is significant on multiple levels:
    - As in many heroic narratives, the protagonist is aware of challenges or perceptions that will soon shape his destiny, allowing narrative progression and internal development.
    - It also marks the transition to a phase where Nāmakaokapāo‘o will be tested by established chiefs, i.e., entry into the chiefly hero cycle.

• **Etymology and Symbolism in Names**  
  – ‘Ama‘u: In botanical terms, ʻamaʻu is a native Hawaiian fern, but here, as a name, it may suggest endurance, rootedness, or ancient lineage connected to the land (especially relevant for an ali‘i of O‘ahu).
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o: As previously discussed, “Nā maka o ka pāo‘o”—the eyes of the pāo‘o fish—suggests watchfulness, mystique, and a liminal, transformative capability (pāo‘o being a cave-dwelling or shapeshifting fish in some traditions). The symbolism of “maka” (eye or bud) and “pāo‘o” (dark, hidden, protected) also resonates with the narrative themes of concealed power, emergent potential, or the germination of new ali‘i mana.

• **Cultural Practices and Narrative Functions**  
  – The motif of the orphaned or exceptional child, bereft of one or both parents and subsequently involved in contests with established local leaders, is widespread in Hawaiian and Polynesian storytelling. It shapes the narrative trajectory toward the inevitable contest of mana, and frequently serves to critique or reset social order (especially when the youthful protagonist supplants, reeducates, or complements the authority of older ali‘i).

In summary, this paragraph deftly weaves together themes of mourning, chiefly rivalry, the miraculous deeds of the hero-child, and the mechanisms of oral announcement and challenge. It sets the stage for the testing of Nāmakaokapāo‘o and dramatizes the emergence of new mana in the wake of generational transition.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p11,1,11,"A laila, lawe akula ia i kona makuahine e hūnā ma ke ana o Waipouli. A nalo ka makuahine, ho'i maila ia ā ko lākou hale ma Keahumoa, noho ihola.

When his mother was concealed, he returned to their house at Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house, pulled aside the grass from both the back and the front, and lay down right in the middle on the very top of the roof.","• **Narrative Context:** This paragraph describes a critical moment of separation and concealment within the unfolding narrative. The actions undertaken center around Nāmakaokapāo'o (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o: the eyes-of-the pāo'o [an elusive reef fish], a name suggesting watchfulness, alertness, and perhaps destining the child for cunning survival).
   – **Hiding the Mother (Pōka'ī) at Waipouli:** He takes his mother to be hidden inside a cave at Waipouli. *Waipouli* means ""dark or cloudy water,"" and caves were traditional places of refuge and concealment in Hawaiian narratives, often associated with spiritual or liminal spaces. This act marks a transition point, with the mother removed from the vulnerability of domestic life and the boy assuming new autonomy.
   – **Returning Alone to Keahumoa:** After securing his mother’s safety, Nāmakaokapāo'o returns to their house at Keahumoa. *Ke-ahu-moa* (""The Chicken Mound"") is a place-name frequent in mo‘olelo from central O‘ahu, an area associated with both cultivation (especially ‘uala—sweet potato) and disturbance by legendary figures. The action of ""noho ihola"" (settling/staying there) signals that the protagonist is not fleeing but rather poised for confrontation or endurance.

• **Climbing to the Roof – Symbolic Action:**
   – Nāmakaokapāo'o climbs onto the *kaupoku o ka hale* (ridge/top of the house), an unusual act for a child or household member. In Hawaiian architectural tradition, the roof was both a protective covering and a taboo space, sometimes reserved as the domain of gods or kapu visitors; to ascend the rooftop is to invert customary social and spatial order, perhaps signaling an assertion of agency or extraordinary status.
   – The detail ""wehe a‘ela i ka mau‘u o ke kua a me ke alo"" (he pulled aside the grass from the back and the front) references the thatching of grass on traditional hale (houses). This act suggests not only exposure to risk—removing protective barriers—but also a kind of laying bare or revealing, both literal and metaphorical. The duality of ""kua"" (back) and ""alo"" (front) echoes poetic patterns of encompassing all sides, reflecting wholeness or total engagement with danger/challenge.
   – ""Moe ihola ma waena i luna pono o ke kaupoku"" (lay down right in the middle on the very top of the roof): To lie exposed at the summit of the house frames Nāmakaokapāo'o as sentinel or as bait, either readying himself for the expected threat or defying danger by his conspicuous presence. In epic narratives, such vulnerability is often a precursor to the display of exceptional qualities—courage, supernatural protection, or destined confrontation.

• **Cultural and Allegorical Readings:**
   – **Concealment and Exposure:** The paired actions of hiding the mother and openly exposing oneself reflect the dual themes of protection and self-sacrifice or calculated risk common in mo‘olelo. The child takes on the burden of being the visible focus, a strategic inversion of expected protective hierarchies (the parent usually shelters the child).
   – **Themes of Transition:** The cave of Waipouli functions as a threshold space (wāhi pana) where ordinary rules are suspended—potentially a reference to sanctuary customs in ancient Hawai‘i, where caves were used for refuge from pursuing enemies or sorcery.
   – **Foreshadowing Confrontation:** The exposure atop the roof signals readiness for impending danger (likely from Puali‘i or other threats alluded to in previous paragraphs). It positions Nāmakaokapāo'o as both vulnerable and empowered, a hallmark of hero trajectories in Hawaiian tradition—testing strength under extreme, sometimes sacrificial, circumstances.

• **Linguistic and Structural Notes:**
   – The explicit narration of step-by-step actions—hiding, returning, climbing, opening, lying down—is characteristic of Hawaiian storytelling rhythms, grounding supernatural or highly symbolic events in earthy, specific motions.
   – The sequence sets up a classic motif: separation and ordeal, laying the groundwork for transformations or revelations, suggesting that Nāmakaokapāo'o is about to enter a new phase of his existential and cultural journey.","Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

When they reached the plain of Keahumoa, they entered the house but found no one inside. As they were preparing to leave, Nāmakaokapāo‘o called out from above the rooftop. When they heard the voice, but saw no body, they asked, “Where are you, you who are speaking?” Nāmakaokapāo‘o replied, “Here I am up here.” Eight men climbed up—four at the back of the house, four at the front—until they found Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Nāmakaokapāo‘o said, “What brings you here?” They answered, “We have come to fight Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a little child like you, very strong and brave, who has slain his own father, Puali‘i.”","**Narrative and Cultural Analysis:**
• **Introduction of Opposing Forces:**  
  – The passage marks the mobilization of significant martial force: ‘Ama‘u (ʻa-maʻu, perhaps “the fern” or a chiefly name derived from a fern, symbolic of resilience and regality) from **Waikīkī** (well-known as a seat of aliʻi power in traditional Oʻahu society) dispatches four groups of warriors, each containing forty-eight men (kanahā kumamāwalu = 48). The use of this specific number is notable and may carry symbolic meaning—multiples of four and the number forty-eight frequently appear as significant, cosmologically resonant numbers in Polynesian cultures. Their repetition across the four groups (totaling 192 men) symbolizes completeness and martial rigor, implying a formally sanctioned military action rather than an impromptu raid.

• **Setting and Action:**
  – The warriors travel to **Keahumoa** (“the chicken heap,” a dry plain inland of Honouliuli, often portrayed in tradition as a place of contest and transformation), and upon entering the house, find it empty. This moment of emptiness and anticipation builds narrative tension, emphasizing the house not simply as a residence but as a stage for confrontation and potential transformation.

• **Supernatural or Heroic Concealment:**  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o reveals himself only by voice, calling from atop the rooftop (kaupoku), which is both a literal vantage point and a metaphorical assertion of higher status, perspective, or spiritual potency. The device of the voice heard but body unseen evokes a motif common in Hawaiian mo‘olelo, where heroes, demigods, or supernatural children display powers of concealment, ventriloquism, or telepresence—often as a test for lesser mortals. His refusal to show himself immediately parallels the actions of kupua (shape-shifters or demigods), suggesting his unique status.

• **Dialogue and Challenge:**
  – The elite group of eight men (a highly tapu, or sacred, number, often referencing cardinal points, completeness, or the duality of male and female in traditional counting or organizing) split up to encircle and locate the boy—four in front, four in back—underscoring methodical, ritual encirclement as might be used in battle or in ritual capture of a supernatural being. Such spatial arrangements also resonate with the kapu system, where specific protocols dictated how approach to sacred individuals or spaces must be made.

  – Upon being found, Nāmakaokapāoʻo calmly demands their purpose, demonstrating youthful fearlessness and authority—consistent with previous descriptions of his unmatched bravery and perhaps divine parentage.

• **Accusation and Reputation:**  
  – The warriors’ answer summarizes the growing legend of Nāmakaokapāo‘o: a small child (keiki ‘u‘uku), exceptionally strong and brave (ikaika a me ke koa loa), but also ominously, the one who killed his own father (kona makua kāne, ʻo Puali‘i).  
    – Patricide in Hawaiian narrative is extremely rare and often considered kapu in itself, carrying heavy allegorical significance. It marks Nāmakaokapāo‘o as both an outlaw and a transformative agent, upending the established order (potentially referencing historical disruption of the 'Ai Kapu religious system or the rise of new chiefly lines defeating old ones).
    – This charge also signals to the audience the gravity of the warriors’ mission—it is not merely a battle of equals but a retributive, purificatory act ordered by a higher chief (‘Ama‘u of Waikīkī), meant to quell an existential threat to the social and moral order.

• **Symbolic and Etymological Notes:**
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o): “the eyes of the pāo‘o fish.” The pāo‘o is a small, dark fish known for its persistence and agility in rocky tide pools, a metaphor for resourcefulness, survival, and obscurity. “Eyes” (*maka*) often symbolize vision, insight, or a watchful nature. As in earlier passages, this name, linked with current action—being unseen yet present, “seeing” all from above—reinforces the child’s supernatural attributes.
  – **Puali‘i:** The slain father—the name connotes “descendant/child of a chief,” amplifying the gravity of the killing as not only an act against a parent but a crime against high rank.

• **Allegorical and Moral Interpretation:**
  – This episode frames Nāmakaokapāo‘o as occupying a liminal, or boundary, status: he is both hale (of the house) but also apart (on the roof, unseen), both child (keiki ‘u‘uku) and killer, both feared and sought out by great warriors. Thus, he embodies paradox and transformation.  
    – The story here allegorizes the disruption of established social orders, possibly signifying a shift in religious or political power (cf. upheavals at the end of the 'Ai Kapu period or during major chiefly wars).  
    – The number symbolism and coordinated military engagement may indicate the ritual seriousness with which breaches of kapu or social order were met—in this case, the warriors are not mere avengers but agents of restoration.

• **Conclusion—Narrative Function:**
  – This passage expertly weaves martial organization, supernatural motifs, and deep cultural anxieties about order and transgression. It sets the stage for a confrontation that is not only physical but cosmological and moral. The careful unfolding of dialogue and group action displays the classic structure of Hawaiian epic, balancing individual mana (spiritual power) with collective authority, and foreshadows a test of status, right, and survival.","Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, ""Where is that voice coming from?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I'm up here."" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""What in the world are you all doing here?"" They said, ""We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.""","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

When they reached below, Nāmakaokapāo'o attacked, slaying them all, except for one man, who ran until he reached 'Ama'u at Waikīkī. He announced the death of them all, leaving himself as the one to carry the news for 'Ama'u to hear.","**Narrative Context and Analysis:**
• **Climactic Encounter and Heroic Deed:** This paragraph presents a pivotal moment in the narrative arc: Nāmakaokapāo'o confronts a group that seeks his death, demonstrating extraordinary prowess and agency in the face of collective threat. The passage specifies the protagonist's assertion of identity and namesake, the antagonists’ response, the ensuing battle, and the solitary survivor who becomes a messenger, thus advancing the plot and foreshadowing new conflict.

• **Names and Etymology:**
   – **Nā-ma-ka-o-ka-pāo'o**: ""The eyes of the pāo'o (a type of goby fish)""; as seen in the previous commentary, the name carries symbolic weight, likely representing keen perception (maka = eyes), lineage, and the qualities of a person who can see through danger or deception. His declaration, ""he inoa nona"" (‘I am named for him’), suggests an explicit recognition of inherited power or legacy—typical in mo‘olelo for underlining the significance of genealogy and honor.
   – **Ko'olau**: Lit. “windward,” a traditional district in O‘ahu, but also a motif in stories for locales of testing or journeying—this reference places Nāmakaokapāo'o's deeds in a storied landscape, emphasizing his reach and reputation.
   – **'Ama'u**: Likely named after the endemic fern (Sadleria cyatheoides), commonly found in upland areas and often used in poetic or allegorical senses; here 'Ama'u as a person or place in Waikīkī acts as a new locus for the story’s unfolding conflict or report.

• **Dialogue Structure and Hawaiian Discourse:**
   – The exchange unfolds with ritualized assertion (""Ua 'ike au...he kanaka nui..."") and testing—hallmarks of pre-contact Hawaiian narrative, where heroes often validate their identity and worth before their adversaries. Pronouncement of death before combat is also common, reflecting the ‘ai kapu era’s emphasis on prophecy, fate, and the possibility of supernatural intervention.

• **Combat and its Symbolic Functions:**
   – The phrase ""pau loa i ka make"" (‘all completely dead’) and the motif of a sole survivor are notable; in Hawaiian epics, total annihilation with a single surviving witness often serves to affirm the superlative might of the protagonist while ensuring that news of his deeds spreads (see the tradition of 'āha'ilono, news bearers).
   – In the context of chiefly conflict, sparing one survivor to carry the news (rather than utter obliteration) is both practical and dramatic, and evokes the role of oral transmission in preserving hero-stories. This ""messenger"" trope may also tie to ancient practices of letting vanquished foes live to recount the victor’s prowess and reinforce the hero’s legendary status.
   
• **Cultural Practice – Compassion within Destruction:**
   – Allowing a single adversary to escape is not merely a narrative convenience; it aligns with ancient codes of conduct, where absolute destruction without witness was avoided. The ""āha'ilono"" (messenger, bringer of news) was often a required figure, ensuring memory and dire warning were carried forth—a method of psychological warfare as well as record-keeping.

• **Allegorical Layer – Identity and Legacy:**
   – The conflict centers not just on physical combat but on the question of identity and inheritance (“I am named for him”). Hawaiian epistemology often ties power, legitimacy, and survival to one’s ability to claim lineage and fulfill ancestral promise. This contest is thus more than bodily; it is a struggle for ancestral honor, legitimacy, and continuation of the line.

• **Transitional Function:**
   – The survivor’s flight to Waikīkī and delivery of the fatal news to 'Ama'u propels the narrative toward broader conflict, perhaps with higher chiefs or new adversaries, anchoring the story firmly in the interconnected geography and society of ancient Hawai‘i.

• **Summary:** 
   – This paragraph exemplifies the heroic confrontation motif typical in Hawaiian mo‘olelo. It underscores the protagonist’s unmatched might, the crucial affirmation of identity through ancestry, and the role of news-bearing in perpetuating deed and fame. The geography (Ko‘olau, Waikīkī), names, and modes of combat collectively reflect a society in which bodily prowess, spoken word, and genealogical assertion were central to both individual status and the unfolding of oral tradition.","Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him."" The soldiers said, ""No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive."" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""Well, let's go down and fight."" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

When 'Ama'u and his men reached 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o persisted in slaughtering them until there were none left; not a single person survived, and 'Ama'u perished. Thus, all of O'ahu became subject to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then, he fetched his mother and established her over the land of O'ahu.","**Paragraph 14:**
• This passage brings the narrative to a critical moment of conquest and political turning point, following a traditional structure in Hawaiian mo'olelo (stories) in which personal vengeance or the assertion of aliʻi (chiefly) power results in a change of rulership, often signifying the shifting fortunes of lineages and the sanctity of maternal ancestry.
  
• **Characters and Place Names:**
  – **'Ama'u:** Likely a chief of O'ahu, the name 'Ama'u may derive from the word for a native fern (*Sadleria sp.*), symbolizing resilience or abundance. Chiefs' names often bear associations with landscape features, plants, or animals, reflecting mana (spiritual power) and their relationship to the land.
  – **Nāmakaokapāo'o (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o):** Literally ""the eyes of the pāo'o (goby fish)""—as highlighted in the earlier examples, the name is figurative and may imply watchfulness, adaptability, and persistence, qualities associated with the pāo'o fish, which traverses both fresh and saltwater zones and can endure difficult conditions.

• **Political and Social Structure:**
  – The mustering of ""he 'umi kumamāwalu"" (eighteen war canoes) alludes to the organized military actions of aliʻi during the pre-contact and 'Ai Kapu periods. The number is symbolically significant in Hawaiian storytelling—numbers such as eighteen mark the scale of the conflict and would be understood as an imposing force, underscoring the magnitude of the coming battle.
  – The reference to landing at 'Ewa (an important district on Oʻahu) to confront Nāmakaokapāo'o situates this event in a politically and agriculturally rich region, historically a center of aliʻi power and competition for land and resources.

• **The Battle and Its Aftermath:**
  – The description ""noke mai ana 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o i ka luku ā pau loa"" (""Nāmakaokapāo'o persisted in annihilating them completely"") reflects the extremity of the conflict. Complete destruction is emphasized—""'a'ohe kanaka koe"" (""not a single person remained"")—evoking the concept of ""luku"" (to massacre, utterly destroy), a motif in stories of conquest and extermination in Hawaiian oral tradition.
  – The death of 'Ama'u marks the collapse of the opposing chiefly line and signals a dramatic shift in the island's political landscape—""Puni a'ela 'o O'ahu nei iā Nāmakaokapāo'o"" (""all of O'ahu was encompassed/generated/overcome by Nāmakaokapāo'o""). The verb ""puni"" can mean to be covered over, surrounded, or destroyed, but in chiefly context, it also connotes the total subjugation of a territory.

• **Maternal Lineage and the Principle of 'Reciprocal Atonement':**
  – After his victory, Nāmakaokapāo'o brings his mother (""ki'i akula ia i kona makuahine"") and installs her as sovereign (""ho'onoho ihola i luna o ka 'āina O'ahu nei""). This action highlights a foundational Hawaiian value: the primacy of maternal lineage (moʻokūʻauhau), and the aliʻi practice of securing status and political power through the mother’s rank.  
  – It was well understood that the mother’s mana, especially if she was herself of high descent, legitimized a chief's claim. The physical act of bringing the mother and establishing her as ruler binds the victory to genealogy, ensuring the perpetuation of his line’s authority over Oʻahu and aligning with the broader Polynesian pattern of matrilineal validation of chiefly rights.

• **Allegorical and Symbolic Interpretation:**
  – The absolute wiping out of 'Ama'u and his men may function as an allegory for the ending of an era or the establishment of a new order, echoing patterns of cyclical renewal.  
  – The installation of the mother as ruler is deeply symbolic: it represents a return, or homage, to the source of life and authority, central to the maintenance of pono (cosmic balance) in both the land and chiefly rule.
  – In the context of the 'Ai Kapu epoch, where social order depended on the maintenance of sacred eating taboos and careful genealogical reckoning, this moment signifies both a climax of martial prowess and a restoration—or even elevation—of sacred order through the female line.

• **Conclusion:**
  – This passage encapsulates an archetypal moment of Hawaiian mo'olelo: through decisive action and adherence to cultural protocols, the protagonist not only conquers but legitimizes and stabilizes his rule by honoring maternal ancestry—a framework vital to the structure and transmission of Hawaiian chiefly authority and tradition.","When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
