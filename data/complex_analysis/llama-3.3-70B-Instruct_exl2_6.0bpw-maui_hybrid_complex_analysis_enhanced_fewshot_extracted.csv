There was no one like him from Hawai'i to Ni'ihau in his small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha'i was his father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in Kahikinu'u. Pōka'ī was his mother. His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part god.","• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by disclosing: 
  – **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes a description of their (approximate) age and/or physique/physical attributes; 
  – **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s, caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes a description; 
  – **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew up or are living in at the time the story takes place; 
• The main protagonists described in the first paragraph are: 
  – 1) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (m) (the eyes of the pāo'o fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no comparison from Hawai'i to Ni'ihau for his small stature and strength; 
    – The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into: Nā (the) - maka (eyes) - o (of) - ka (the) - pāo'o (a type of fish), possibly symbolizing the boy's strong connection to the sea or the spiritual realm, as fish were considered a symbol of abundance and spiritual guidance in Hawaiian culture.
  – 2) Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha'i): Nāmakaokapāo'o's father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign country), a place in Kahiki-nu'u (Kahiki at the summit, a foreign country); 
    – The name Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i can be broken down into: Ka (the) - ulu (inspiration, growth) - a (of) - Kaha'i (a hero who traveled to 'Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit), possibly indicating the father's adventurous and courageous nature.
  – 3) Pō-ka-'ī (f) (perhaps 'night falls upon the high chief'): Nāmakaokapāo'o's mother; no further description; 
    – The name Pō-ka-'ī can be broken down into: Pō (night) - ka (the) - 'ī (high chief), possibly symbolizing the mother's connection to the spiritual realm and her high social status.
• The mention of Kahikipapaialewa and Kahikinu'u suggests that the story is set in a time when Hawaiian chiefs had connections with foreign lands, possibly during the 'Ai Kapu era, when Hawaiian society was heavily influenced by spiritual and social hierarchies.
• The fact that Kauluakaha'i is described as a high chief and part god (he 'ao'ao akua kekahi ona) indicates that the story is likely set in a time when the Hawaiian spiritual system was still strongly influenced by the worship of gods and the belief in the divine right of chiefs.
• The overall tone of the passage suggests that Nāmakaokapāo'o is a special child, possibly destined for greatness, and that his unique physical and spiritual attributes will play a significant role in the story that unfolds.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother.

On the surface, the story appears to recount the life of a small yet incredibly strong child, Nāmakaokapāo'o, who navigates a series of challenges and confrontations, ultimately emerging as the ruler of the land of O'ahu. However, upon closer examination, the narrative reveals itself to be a rich allegory, replete with symbolism and allusions to Hawaiian cultural and historical contexts.

One of the primary themes that emerges from this narrative is the concept of power and its various manifestations. Nāmakaokapāo'o's extraordinary strength, for instance, can be seen as a metaphor for the assertion of native Hawaiian autonomy and resistance against colonial and oppressive forces. This reading is reinforced by the character's actions, particularly his confrontation with Puali'i, which can be interpreted as a representation of the struggle against foreign domination and the imposition of Western values.

The historical and cultural context of the narrative is equally significant, with references to specific locations, such as Hō'ae'ae in 'Ewa, Kahikipapaialewa, and Keahumoa, which serve to ground the story in the geographical and cultural landscape of Hawai'i. The mention of high chiefs, such as Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai'a, further underscores the narrative's connection to Hawaiian history and the complex system of ali'i (chiefly) authority.

The chapter's significance in Hawaiian literature and cultural analysis lies in its nuanced exploration of the complexities of native Hawaiian identity, power dynamics, and the impact of colonialism on traditional Hawaiian society. The narrative's use of allegory and symbolism allows for a multifaceted analysis, revealing the ways in which Hawaiian cultural values, such as ohana (family) and 'āina (land), are intertwined with the struggle for sovereignty and self-determination.

The temporal context of the narrative is also noteworthy, as it appears to be set in a pre-contact or early contact period, with references to traditional Hawaiian practices, such as fishing and farming. However, the narrative's composition and publication history suggest a more complex temporal framework, with potential connections to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a period of significant cultural, social, and political upheaval in Hawai'i.

In this regard, the narrative can be seen as a form of cultural resistance, one that employs allegory and symbolism to critique the dominant Western narrative and assert a native Hawaiian perspective. The character of Nāmakaokapāo'o, with his extraordinary strength and bravery, can be interpreted as a representation of the Hawaiian people's resilience and determination in the face of colonialism and oppression.

The potential political implications of this narrative are also worthy of consideration, particularly in the context of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Hawai'i was undergoing a period of rapid modernization and cultural transformation. The narrative's themes of power, resistance, and native Hawaiian autonomy can be seen as a form of counter-narrative, one that challenges the dominant Western discourse and asserts a native Hawaiian perspective on history, culture, and identity.

In conclusion, the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo'o offers a rich and complex exploration of Hawaiian cultural values, historical contexts, and the complexities of native Hawaiian identity. Through its nuanced use of allegory and symbolism, the narrative provides a multifaceted analysis of the power dynamics at play in traditional Hawaiian society, as well as the impact of colonialism on native Hawaiian culture and identity. As such, this narrative represents a significant contribution to Hawaiian literature and cultural analysis, one that warrants further study and consideration in the context of Hawaiian cultural and historical studies."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. A hāpai ‘o Pōka‘ī iā   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i i kona  ‘āina, noho ihola ‘o Pōka‘ī me kona hāpai, a ma hope, hānau. Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o  Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","Nāmakaokapāo'o was conceived at Hō'ae'ae in 'Ewa, and when Pōka'ī gave birth to him, Kauluakaha'i returned to his land. Pōka'ī stayed with her newborn, Nāmakaokapāo'o, and later gave birth. At this birth, Pōka'ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo'o were extremely exhausted.","• The passage introduces the location of Hō'ae'ae in 'Ewa, which is significant as it is the place where Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o was conceived. 'Ewa is a district on the island of O'ahu, and Hō'ae'ae likely refers to a specific area or ahupua'a within that district. The name Hō'ae'ae can be broken down into Hō-ae-ae, where ""hō"" means ""to plead"" or ""to beg,"" ""ae"" means ""to rise"" or ""to ascend,"" and the repetition of ""ae"" may emphasize the action or intensity of the rising. This etymology could imply a place of spiritual or ancestral significance, where prayers or pleas are made to the gods.
– The conception of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o at this location may hold allegorical meaning, as it could represent the union of spiritual and worldly forces, symbolizing the beginning of a new era or the dawn of a new understanding.
• The passage also mentions Pō-ka-'ī giving birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, and Kau-lua-kaha'i returning to his land. The name Kau-lua-kaha'i can be broken down into Kau-lua-kaha'i, where ""kau"" means ""season"" or ""time,"" ""lua"" means ""two,"" and ""kaha'i"" refers to a place or a stratum. This etymology could imply a connection to the cycles of time, the balance between dual forces, or the navigation of different realms or dimensions.
– The fact that Kau-lua-kaha'i returns to his land after Pō-ka-'ī gives birth may suggest a separation or a distinction between the spiritual and worldly realms, highlighting the different roles or responsibilities that each character embodies.
• The phrase ""he 'ilihune loa 'o Pōka'ī a me kāna keiki 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o"" describes Pōka'ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo'o as being extremely exhausted after the birth. The word ""'ilihune"" can be broken down into 'ili-hune, where ""'ili"" means ""to cling"" or ""to stick,"" and ""hune"" means ""to be tired"" or ""to be exhausted."" This etymology could imply a deep emotional or physical connection between Pōka'ī and her child, as well as a sense of depletion or exhaustion after the birth.
– This exhaustion may be seen as a symbol of the challenges and hardships that Pōka'ī and Nāmakaokapāo'o will face in their journey, as well as the idea that their bond will be tested and transformed throughout the story. In the context of Hawaiian cultural tradition, the 'Ai Kapu era, and the historical period in which this story takes place, the themes of conception, birth, and exhaustion may be linked to the cycles of nature, the balance between spiritual and worldly forces, and the navigation of different realms or dimensions.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p3,1,3,"Iā lāua e noho ana, iho maila ‘o Puali‘i, he  kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e, i ka lawai‘a ma kai o  Honouliuli, kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka‘ī.

Puali'i saw Pōka'ī, liked her, and said, ""I want you as my woman."" Pōka'ī replied, ""Why would you want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is worn out."" Puali'i said, ""Those things don't matter; if you like me, let's sleep together."" Pōka'ī agreed, and she went with her husband and Puali'i to the plains of Keahumoa to live.","• The passage introduces a new character, Pua-li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), who arrives from Līhu'e (perhaps a place of spiritual or ancestral significance, considering the etymology of Lī-hu'e: Lī - ""to ascend, climb"" and hu'e - ""to drift, float""), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay, possibly symbolizing a transition or a place of spiritual growth).
• Pua-li'i visits Pō-ka-'ī's (perhaps ""night falls upon the high chief"") house, which is a common practice in Hawaiian culture, especially during the 'Ai Kapu era, where hospitality and generosity were highly valued. This custom is rooted in the concept of aloha (love, compassion) and the importance of building relationships within the community.
• Pua-li'i is immediately drawn to Pō-ka-'ī and expresses his desire to be with her as his wahine (woman, partner). Pō-ka-'ī, however, is hesitant due to her perceived flaws, having given birth to a child (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o) and feeling that her body is worn out. This exchange highlights the cultural emphasis on physical appearance and the societal pressures on women during the 'Ai Kapu era.
• Pua-li'i's response, ""He mea 'ole ia mau mea, ke makemake 'oe ia'u, e moe kāua"" (""Those things don't matter; if you like me, let's sleep together""), suggests a more progressive and accepting attitude, which may be seen as a contrast to the traditional 'Ai Kapu values. This could be interpreted as a symbolic representation of the changing times and the shift towards more Westernized values.
• The agreement between Pō-ka-'ī and Pua-li'i to be together, marked by the phrase ""‘Ae akula ‘o Pōka‘ī"" (""Pōka'ī agreed""), signifies a new beginning and a potential departure from the traditional norms. The fact that they relocate to Ke-ahu-moa (heap of chickens), a place in Līhu'e, may symbolize a fresh start, a new cycle of life, or a connection to the ancestral lands.
– The name Ke-ahu-moa can be broken down into its components: Ke-ahu (the heap, pile) and moa (chicken). In Hawaiian culture, chickens were considered a symbol of fertility, abundance, and spiritual growth. The relocation to Keahumoa may represent a desire for spiritual renewal, fertility, or a connection to the natural world.
• The passage as a whole can be seen as an allegory for the complexities of human relationships, the challenges of societal expectations, and the quest for personal growth and transformation. The characters' interactions and decisions may be interpreted as a reflection of the cultural and historical context in which they live, with the 'Ai Kapu era serving as a backdrop for the narrative.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

When the sweet potatoes were cooked, Puali'i uttered his habitual phrase, ""The head of the ulua fish is cooked with the sweet potatoes, and Puali'i eats, then it is permissible, his wife Pōka'ī and others eat as well."" Therefore, Puali'i went to the sea of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with the sweet potatoes.","• The passage begins by describing Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's continued presence in a location, likely a farm or a residential area, where he is engaged in farming activities (mahī 'ai) to produce food. The term 'elua āna mau māla 'uala lō'ihi refers to two large sweet potato patches that have been preserved until the present day (ā hiki i kēia lā). The name of these patches is said to be Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, which suggests a connection between the protagonist's name and the sweet potato patches.
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its constituent parts: Nā- (the) + maka (eyes) + o (of) + ka (the) + pāo'o (a type of fish, possibly a reference to the ulua fish). This etymological analysis may indicate a symbolic connection between the protagonist, the sweet potato patches, and the ulua fish, which is a significant food source in Hawaiian culture.
• Puali'i's habitual phrase, ""Aia ā kālua ke po'o o ka ulua me ka 'uala,"" suggests a cultural practice where the head of the ulua fish is cooked with sweet potatoes, making it permissible for others to eat as well. This phrase may be related to the 'Ai Kapu era, where certain foods were restricted to specific individuals or groups.
– The 'Ai Kapu system, which was in place from around the 12th to the 18th centuries, imposed strict rules on food consumption, including the types of food that could be eaten by different social classes and the rituals surrounding food preparation and consumption. Puali'i's phrase may be an example of how this system influenced everyday life and food culture in ancient Hawaii.
• The passage also highlights the importance of fishing as a means of supplementing the food supply, as Puali'i goes to the sea of Honouliuli to catch fish to eat with the sweet potatoes. This emphasizes the significance of the ocean as a source of food and the interconnectedness of farming and fishing activities in Hawaiian culture.
– The mention of Honouliuli, a location on the island of Oahu, provides a geographical context for the story and may suggest that the events are taking place in a specific region or community. This could be relevant for understanding the cultural and historical context of the narrative.
• Allegorically, the passage may be interpreted as a representation of the balance between farming and fishing activities, as well as the importance of ritual and cultural practices in Hawaiian society. The connection between Nāmakaokapāo'o, the sweet potato patches, and the ulua fish may symbolize the interconnectedness of human life, agriculture, and the natural environment.
– The use of the ulua fish as a symbol may also represent the idea of abundance and fertility, as the ulua fish was considered a sacred animal in Hawaiian culture. The cooking of the ulua fish with sweet potatoes could represent the union of different food sources and the celebration of the abundance of the natural world.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo'o's body at that time was very small, about two finger spans and a half in height, and he wasn't strong, just a little frail. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, he told the children, ""Pull out the sweet potato vines and leaves entirely from the top, don't leave any to grow."" However, the children were lazy, so they just loosely pulled on the sweet potatoes, and didn't pull out the vines.","**Paragraph 5:**
• The scene is set with Pua-li'i going fishing, likely a common practice during the 'Ai Kapu era, where fishing and farming were primary sources of food. 
– This era, which spanned from around the 12th to the 18th century, was characterized by strict rules and regulations governing the lives of Hawaiians, including their diet and interactions.
• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, whose name can be broken down into Nā- (the, plural marker) -maka- (eyes) -o- (of) -ka- (the) -pāo'o (a type of fish, but potentially also referencing 'po'o, or head), is described as being very small, about two finger spans and a half in height.
– The use of -maka- in Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's name may symbolize the importance of vision, insight, or perspective, which could be relevant to the story's themes and allegorical meanings.
• Nāmakaokapāo'o's physical weakness is also highlighted, with the text stating that he wasn't strong, just a little frail (e lewalewa ana nō).
– This portrayal of Nāmakaokapāo'o as frail could serve to underscore his unusual abilities or actions later in the story, or to illustrate the challenges faced by those who do not conform to traditional expectations of strength and virility.
• The instruction given by Nāmakaokapāo'o to the children to pull out the sweet potato vines and leaves entirely from the top is significant.
– In Hawaiian culture, sweet potatoes were a staple crop, and their cultivation and care would have been crucial to the community's survival.
– The act of pulling out the vines could symbolize a break with traditional practices or a rejection of the old ways, which might be seen as stagnant or unproductive.
• The children's laziness and failure to follow Nāmakaokapāo'o's instructions might represent a resistance to change or an attachment to established customs.
– This dynamic could be seen as reflecting the tensions between tradition and innovation, or between the old and the new, which were likely present in Hawaiian society during the 'Ai Kapu era.
• The image of the children loosely pulling on the sweet potatoes, but not pulling out the vines, may also have allegorical significance.
– It could represent a half-hearted or superficial attempt at change, rather than a genuine commitment to transformation or growth.
– Alternatively, it might symbolize the challenges of navigating complex social and cultural expectations, where individuals may feel pressured to conform to certain norms or practices, even if they do not truly believe in or support them.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then Nāmakaokapāo'o went back and lit a fire to broil four sweet potato vines on a fire pit that was burning. As he was broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather came back and reached him and asked Nāmakaokapāo'o's mother, Pōka'ī, and she said, ""No."" Puali'i said, ""Yes, his head and eyes as food to go with the sweet potatoes that I'll eat today. So, today I will kill him.""","• The passage begins with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, a name that can be broken down into its constituent parts: Nā- (the) -maka- (eyes) -o- (of) -ka- (the) -pāo'o (pāo'o fish). The pāo'o fish is likely used as a poetic reference to the head (po'o) of the ulua fish, which is a significant symbol in Hawaiian culture, especially during the 'Ai Kapu era. The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may allude to the idea of watching or observing, and in this context, Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions can be seen as a form of observation or commentary on the societal norms of his time.
– The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o is tearing apart the sweet potato patches, one on top of the other, may symbolize the dismantling of the 'Ai Kapu system, which was a complex set of rules and regulations that governed the lives of Hawaiians during that time period. The sweet potato was a staple crop in Hawaiian society, and its destruction may represent the upheaval of traditional practices and the emergence of new ideas.
• The numbers mentioned in the passage, such as 2, 4, and 40, are likely significant and may hold esoteric meaning. In Hawaiian culture, numbers often had symbolic meanings, and these numbers may be used to convey a specific message or theme. For example, the number 40 may represent a complete or perfect amount, while the number 2 may symbolize duality or balance.
– The image of the sweet potato leaves rising like a mound may also be symbolic, representing the idea of growth, abundance, or fertility. The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o is broiling four sweet potato vines on a fire pit may represent the idea of transformation or change, as the sweet potatoes are being cooked and prepared for consumption.
• The conversation between Puali'i and Pōka'ī is also noteworthy, as it reveals the dynamics of their relationship and the cultural norms of their time. Puali'i's threat to eat Nāmakaokapāo'o's head and eyes as food to go with the sweet potatoes may be seen as a form of intimidation or control, and Pōka'ī's response of ""No"" may indicate her disagreement or disapproval of Puali'i's actions.
– The fact that Puali'i mentions eating Nāmakaokapāo'o's head and eyes may also be symbolic, representing the idea of consuming or destroying the old ways of thinking. The head and eyes may represent the source of knowledge, wisdom, or power, and Puali'i's threat to eat them may symbolize the idea of suppressing or eliminating these qualities.
• The passage as a whole may be seen as an allegory for the changes that were taking place in Hawaiian society during the 'Ai Kapu era. Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions may represent the desire for change and the dismantling of traditional practices, while Puali'i's response may represent the resistance to change and the desire to maintain the status quo. The conversation between Puali'i and Pōka'ī may represent the complexities and challenges of navigating these changes, and the need for adaptability and resilience in the face of uncertainty.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw and ran to a distance and stood watching Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Here is the adze in my hand, it will cut off your head today and your head will be cooked with the sweet potato, and I will eat it first, and then it will be free."" Nāmakaokapāo'o did not listen to Puali'i's words, and Puali'i spoke again, of the pit. Puali'i was ready to hit Nāmakaokapāo'o with the adze, at the time when Nāmakaokapāo'o was praying his death prayer for Puali'i. The prayer was like this: 
Love only the face of my pāo'o fish, 
Striking, opposing, 
Eating or leaving, 
Leaving perhaps Nākukui'aimakaokalani, 
That is Kukui'aimakaokalani, 
My pāo'o fish companion, 
Nāmakaokai'a is the great chief of Hawai'i, 
Move, move only the spear, 
The person with the spear, 
The spear with the dagger, 
Die because of Nāmakaokapāo'o.","• This passage marks a pivotal moment in the narrative where tensions between Puali'i and Nāmakaokapāo'o escalate: 
  – Puali'i's anger and decision to use the adze (ko'ilipi) against Nāmakaokapāo'o signifies a violent intent, characteristic of conflicts within the 'Ai Kapu era, where violence was sometimes used to resolve disputes or assert dominance.
  – The adze, a tool used for various tasks including woodworking and as a weapon, represents both utility and violence, symbolizing the duality of human nature in Hawaiian culture.
• The reaction of the children (keiki) running to a distance and watching Puali'i indicates fear and recognition of the severity of the situation, highlighting the impact of adult conflicts on the community, especially the younger members.
• Nāmakaokapāo'o's indifference to Puali'i's threats and his engagement in a death prayer (pule make) for Puali'i suggest a spiritual or mystical dimension to their conflict:
  – The content of Nāmakaokapāo'o's prayer provides insight into his character, invoking the imagery of the pāo'o fish and referencing figures like Nākukui'aimakaokalani and Nāmakaokai'a, which may symbolize ancestral or divine connections.
  – The mention of Kukui'aimakaokalani as a companion and the reference to Nāmakaokai'a as a great chief of Hawai'i indicate a complex network of relationships and alliances, possibly alluding to real or mythical historical figures.
  – The use of natural imagery and the invocation of powerful beings or concepts (like the pāo'o fish, the great chief of Hawai'i, and the action of spears and daggers) in the prayer may serve to underscore the spiritual or transcendental aspects of the conflict, suggesting that the outcomes are not solely determined by human actions but also by divine or cosmic forces.
• The allegorical interpretation of this passage might involve the struggle between old and new, tradition and change, symbolized by the characters of Puali'i and Nāmakaokapāo'o:
  – Puali'i, with his adherence to possibly outdated customs or his resistance to change, might represent the old order or the 'Ai Kapu system, which was characterized by strict rules and hierarchies.
  – Nāmakaokapāo'o, with his unique strength, destructive behavior, and spiritual practices, could symbolize the forces of change or the future, potentially embodying characteristics that would become more prevalent in a post-'Ai Kapu society.
• The cultural practice of prayer and invocation of ancestral or divine beings for assistance in conflict resolution or for harming others is reminiscent of practices within the 'Ai Kapu era, where spiritual power and connection to the gods were crucial for legitimacy and success:
  – The specific prayer by Nāmakaokapāo'o, with its references to love, striking, eating or leaving, and the naming of specific beings or concepts, demonstrates a sophisticated spiritual system where individuals could invoke divine power for personal purposes, including harm or protection.
  – This passage also highlights the importance of name etymology and the potential hidden meanings within names like Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish), Nā-kukui-'ai-maka-o-kalani (possibly related to light, food, and the heavens), and Nā-maka-o-kai'a (eyes of the fish of the sea or chief), which may hold significant cultural, spiritual, or historical value.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Now let's talk briefly about those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai'a, they were both high chiefs of Hawai'i, Nāmakaokalani was the father and Nāmakaokai'a was the child, but they were included in the prayers of Nāmakaokapāo'o.","• The paragraph begins by mentioning two new names: Nā-maka-o-ka-lani and Nā-maka-o-kai-'a. These names are likely related to the main protagonist, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, and may hold significance in understanding his character and role in the story.
– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-lani can be broken down into its constituent parts: Nā- (the) + maka (eyes) + o (of) + ka (the) + lani (sky or heaven). This name may suggest a connection to the spiritual or heavenly realm.
– The name Nā-maka-o-kai-'a can be similarly broken down: Nā- (the) + maka (eyes) + o (of) + ka (the) + i (sea or ocean) + 'a (a particle indicating a nominalizing function). This name may indicate a connection to the ocean or the physical world.
• The relationship between Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai'a is described as father and child, respectively. This may imply a generational or hierarchical connection between the two characters.
– In Hawaiian culture, the concept of ohana (family) is deeply important, and the relationships between generations are often seen as crucial to understanding an individual's identity and role in society.
• The fact that Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai'a are included in the prayers of Nāmakaokapāo'o suggests that they may hold spiritual or cultural significance in the story.
– In the 'Ai Kapu era, prayer and spiritual practices were an integral part of daily life, and the inclusion of specific individuals in prayers may have been seen as a way of honoring or seeking guidance from those individuals.
• The mention of these two characters and their relationship to Nāmakaokapāo'o may also serve to highlight the themes of identity, community, and cultural heritage that are present throughout the story.
– The use of names with similar etymologies (Nā-maka-o-) may indicate a sense of continuity or connection between the characters, and may serve to emphasize the importance of understanding one's roots and heritage in navigating the challenges of life.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The head of Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: ""Farewell, Nāmakaokapāo‘o."" Then Nāmakaokapāo‘o's body picked up Puali‘i's head and threw it into the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the shore of Honouliuli, and it was five miles away.","• The passage begins with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o finishing his prayer, which may suggest that he is seeking spiritual guidance or protection. The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its etymological components: Nā- (the) -maka- (eyes) -o- (of) -ka- (the) -pāo'o (a type of fish). This name may hold significance in understanding the character's role and actions throughout the story.
– The use of the name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may also be related to the idea of ""seeing"" or ""vision,"" as the eyes are often associated with insight and understanding. This could be particularly relevant in the context of the 'Ai Kapu era, where spiritual and mystical practices were closely tied to everyday life.
• Puali‘i's actions in hitting Nāmakaokapāo‘o on the head with a stone adze may be seen as a violent and aggressive act, but it could also be interpreted as a symbolic gesture. The stone adze, or ko‘i, was an important tool in ancient Hawaiian culture, used for both practical and ceremonial purposes.
– The fact that Puali‘i uses the stone adze to sever Nāmakaokapāo‘o's head may suggest a desire to ""cut off"" or separate Nāmakaokapāo‘o from his spiritual or mystical connections. This could be seen as a representation of the conflict between traditional 'Ai Kapu practices and the introduction of new, potentially disruptive influences.
• The image of Nāmakaokapāo‘o's head being severed and yet still able to speak from a different place may be seen as a metaphor for the idea that the spiritual or mystical aspects of a person can persist even after physical death.
– This idea may be related to the concept of mana, or spiritual power, which was believed to reside within individuals and objects in ancient Hawaiian culture. The fact that Nāmakaokapāo‘o's head can still speak and communicate with Puali‘i may suggest that his mana has not been fully extinguished.
• The final image of Nāmakaokapāo‘o's body picking up Puali‘i's head and throwing it into the sea may be seen as a symbolic act of revenge or retribution. The fact that the head is thrown into a cave on the shore of Honouliuli, which is five miles away, may suggest a desire to separate or disconnect Puali‘i from the physical world.
– The use of the cave as a symbol may be related to the idea of the underworld or the spiritual realm, which was often associated with caves and other underground spaces in ancient Hawaiian culture. The fact that Puali‘i's head is thrown into this space may suggest a desire to banish or expel him from the world of the living.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
