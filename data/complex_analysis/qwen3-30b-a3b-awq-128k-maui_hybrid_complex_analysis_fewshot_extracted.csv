• The passage opens with a traditional Hawaiian narrative structure, introducing:  
– **a)** The protagonist, **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** (the eyes of the pāo'o fish), described as an exceptionally strong child in his youth. The term *pāo'o* refers to a type of fish, and *maka* (eyes) may symbolize perception or spiritual awareness.  
– **b1)** His father, **Kau-ulu-a-kaha'i** (possibly ""expanding growth of Kaha'i""), a *makua kāne* (father) from **Kahikipapaialewa** (a place in **Kahikinu'u**, the ""summit of Kahiki,"" a term often referencing foreign lands or the spiritual realm).  
– **c)** The father’s status as a **great chief** (*ali'i nui*) tied to **Kahikipapaialewa**, suggesting a lineage of leadership and sacred authority.  
– **b2)** His mother, **Pō-ka-'ī** (possibly ""night falls upon the high chief""), a name evoking imagery of darkness or mystery, possibly linked to ancestral or spiritual forces.  
– **c)** The mother’s name *Pōka'ī* may symbolize the cyclical nature of time or the interplay between day and night, reflecting the balance of life and death in Hawaiian cosmology.  
• The phrase *i ka 'u'uku a me ke koa loa* (""in the strength and bravery of the ulua"") may allude to the *ulua* fish, which in *Ai Kapu* era rituals symbolized human sacrifice. Here, it could metaphorically represent the protagonist’s destructive potential, contrasting with the sacred *Ai Kapu* practices of the past.  
• The mention of *Kahikipapaialewa* and *Kahikinu'u* (the ""summit of Kahiki"") reflects the hierarchical and spiritual geography of Hawaii, where *Kahiki* often denoted foreign lands or the afterlife. The father’s role as a *pālupalu* (priest) of a *kekahi ona* (certain god) ties him to the religious elite of the *Ai Kapu* era, emphasizing his divine connection.  
• The name *Kauluakaha'i* may derive from *kaha'i* (to grow, expand), suggesting a lineage of growth or prosperity, while *Pōka'ī* could symbolize the cyclical nature of existence, aligning with Hawaiian concepts of *mo‘olelo* (history) as an eternal, repeating process.  
• The absence of specific numbers (e.g., 2, 4, 40) in this paragraph contrasts with Example 2, but the emphasis on *‘u‘uku* (fish) and *koa loa* (bravery) retains the symbolic depth of Hawaiian storytelling, where natural elements often represent human traits or divine will.""","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","The chapter centers on the intertwined narratives of lineage, conflict, and spiritual significance in Hawaiian culture, focusing on figures like Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Pōka‘ī, Puli‘i, and Ama‘u. The themes include the transmission of power through ancestry, the tension between familial bonds and territorial disputes, and the role of rituals (such as ko‘ilipi) in shaping destiny. Agricultural practices—taro, sweet potato fields, and fishing—are woven into the story, symbolizing sustenance, sacredness, and the interplay between human activity and divine will. The text also emphasizes the sacredness of places like Honouliuli and Keahumoa, reflecting the deep connection between land, people, and spiritual authority.  

Historically and culturally, the chapter mirrors traditional Hawaiian values of genealogy, where lineage determines social status and responsibility. The conflict between chiefs like Ama‘u and Nāmakaokapāo‘o may allude to struggles for power or land, common in ancient Hawaiian narratives. Rituals and prayers, such as those involving the ""head of the ulua"" (fish) and offerings of fish, pig, and taro, highlight the importance of kapu (sacred laws) and the role of spiritual leaders in mediating between humans and gods. The mention of ""Puli‘i"" (a place) and ""Ko‘ilipi"" (a ritual object) underscores the significance of specific locations and practices in Hawaiian cosmology.  

In Hawaiian literature, this chapter exemplifies the use of mythic storytelling to convey moral and spiritual lessons. The recurring motifs of growth (Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s large head) and destruction (the prayer for his death) reflect the cyclical nature of life and power in Hawaiian tradition. The text also serves as a genealogical record, linking figures to their lands and deities, reinforcing the idea of sacred inheritance. The blending of human and divine elements, such as placing Puli‘i’s head on Nāmakaokapāo‘o, illustrates the fluidity between mortal and spiritual realms.  

The narrative synthesizes these elements into a cohesive tale of familial and territorial struggle, where spiritual rituals and agricultural practices are both tools of survival and instruments of conflict. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s journey—from birth to ritual empowerment, to confrontation with Ama‘u—embodies the interplay of human ambition, divine intervention, and the sacredness of land. The chapter’s significance lies in its preservation of cultural values, its reflection of historical power dynamics, and its role in connecting Hawaiian mythology to the lived experiences of its people."

In this manner of birth, there was a Pōka‘ī and his child Nāmakaokapāo‘o.""","**Paragraph 2:**  
• The structure of this paragraph continues the narrative of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s lineage, emphasizing familial and geographic connections:  
– **Hō‘ae‘ae (place name):** Likely refers to a specific location in Ewa, O‘ahu, suggesting a sacred or significant site. The name ""Hō‘ae‘ae"" may derive from ""ho‘ae"" (to grow, to flourish) or ""ho‘ā‘ā"" (to be full, to be abundant), reflecting a place of fertility or spiritual importance.  
– **""Ma laila lāua i launa kino ai me ka moe ana iho ā loa‘a o Nāmakaokapāo‘o"":** This describes the circumstances of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s birth. ""Launa kino ai"" (to have a child) and ""ka moe ana iho"" (while sleeping) may imply a divine or supernatural origin, as sleep often symbolizes a liminal state between worlds in Hawaiian cosmology. ""Ā loa‘a"" (to find) suggests a serendipitous or fateful discovery, possibly hinting at the child’s destined role.  
– **Pōka‘ī (f) and Kauluakaha‘i (m):** These names are linked to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s parents. ""Pōka‘ī"" may derive from ""pō"" (night) and ""ka‘ī"" (to take, to seize), symbolizing a connection to the spiritual realm or nocturnal forces. ""Kauluakaha‘i"" combines ""kau"" (to stretch, to extend) and ""kaha‘i"" (a name), possibly alluding to a journey or expansion of power.  
• The phrase ""ho‘i akula o Kauluakaha‘i i kona ‘āina"" (Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land) reflects the cultural practice of *kānaka* (humans) navigating between *moʻolelo* (stories) and *ʻōlelo* (language), where ancestral journeys or migrations are often recounted. ""Kona ‘āina"" (his land) emphasizes territorial lineage, tying Kauluakaha‘i to a specific geographic identity.  
• **""Noho ihola o Pōka‘ī me kona hāpai"" (dwelling with Pōka‘ī and his father):** This suggests a dual lineage—Pōka‘ī’s connection to her own father (possibly a deity or high chief) and Kauluakaha‘i’s return to his ancestral land. The term ""hāpai"" (to give birth) may imply a sacred or ritualistic context for the birth, aligning with the *Ai Kapu* era’s emphasis on ritual purity and divine ancestry.  
• **Allegorical interpretation of ""hānau ‘ana"":** The phrase ""ma kēia hānau ‘ana"" (in this way of birth) may allude to the transition from *Ai Kapu* (sacred restrictions) to a post-sacrificial era. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s birth here could symbolize the end of human sacrifice, with ""kāna keiki"" (his child) representing the next generation freed from such practices.  
• **Cultural context:** The repetition of names and places underscores the importance of genealogy in Hawaiian storytelling. Pōka‘ī’s role as a mother and Kauluakaha‘i’s return to his land highlight the interplay between *kupuna* (elders) and *kūkanākā* (descendants), reflecting the *kula* (circle) of ancestral knowledge and responsibility.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puli'i replied: 'These things are not good, you ask me for a wife, let us sleep together.' Pōka‘ī agreed. Then Pōka‘ī returned with his husband and Puli'i to the field of Keahumoa, to stay.""","• **Paragraph 3:**  
  – The passage introduces the protagonist **Puli'i** (Puli‘i), a ""good person"" (kanaka maika‘i) from **Līhu‘e** (Lihue), a region on the island of O‘ahu. His location is specified as ""in the area of Honouliuli's coast"" (i ka lawai‘a ma kai o Honouliuli), indicating a geographic setting tied to specific land divisions.  
  – **Pōka‘ī** (Pokai) is identified as the host (kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka‘ī), suggesting a familial or communal relationship. The phrase ""a guest in the house of Pokai"" implies a temporary or ritualistic stay, possibly reflecting traditional hospitality (aloha ‘āina) or a sacred context.  
  – The dialogue between Puli'i and Pokai revolves around a marriage proposal (makemake iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u), which is a central cultural practice (ho‘oika‘i) in Hawaiian society. Pokai’s refusal (""I have children, and my son is grown"") may allude to the **Ai Kapu** era’s restrictions on marriage, where lineage and status were strictly maintained, and daughters might not be available for union until their father’s obligations were fulfilled.  
  – Puli'i’s response (""He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua"") contains metaphorical language. The phrase ""e moe kāua"" (let us sleep together) could symbolize a union (marriage) or a deeper spiritual bond, while ""he mea ‘ole ia mau mea"" (these things are not good) may critique the rigidity of traditional practices or foreshadow conflict.  
  – The mention of **Keahumoa** (Keahumoa) as the destination for ""to stay"" (noho) suggests a place of significance, possibly a sacred site (heiau) or a symbolic threshold between worlds. The name ""Keahumoa"" might derive from **kea** (white, pure) and **humoa** (a term possibly linked to ""humoa"" meaning ""to rest"" or ""to dwell,"" reflecting a place of settlement or spiritual refuge).  
  – The structure mirrors Hawaiian narrative conventions of introducing characters through their origins, relationships, and symbolic actions. Puli'i’s journey to Pokai’s house and the subsequent dialogue may allegorically represent the tension between traditional values (Ai Kapu) and emerging social changes, such as the breakdown of rigid hierarchies during the **Māori colonization** or **post-contact era**.  
  – **Cultural context:** The term ""maka‘ole"" (not good) in Puli'i’s reply could symbolize the rejection of **kapu** (sacred laws) or the clash between old and new ways. The phrase ""e moe kāua"" (let us sleep together) might allude to **māmā** (to lie with, to be intimate), a verb often used in poetic or metaphorical contexts to signify union, both literal and symbolic.  
  – **Allegorical interpretation:** The narrative may reflect the struggle between **ho‘oika‘i** (marriage alliances) and **kapu** (sacred restrictions). Puli'i’s insistence on ""sleeping together"" despite Pokai’s refusal could symbolize the erosion of traditional social structures, akin to the **Māori** (a term for a person from the moon, often linked to celestial or spiritual themes) or the **Hawaiian concept of 'āina** (land) as a living entity requiring balance. The ""field of Keahumoa"" might represent a metaphorical space for renewal or transformation, aligning with the **māla** (garden) as a symbol of sustenance and cultural continuity.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

No laila, iho akula ‘o Puali‘i i kai o Honouliuli e lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala.”","**Paragraph 4:**  
• The passage introduces **Ihola** (a name) as the resident of a place where two individuals (**‘elua āna**) cultivate ancient **māla ‘uala** (sweet potato fields), preserving them through generations. The naming of these fields as **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (literally ""the eyes of the pāo‘o fish"") connects to the earlier example of **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o**, emphasizing a symbolic link between the protagonist’s physical traits (eyes) and the sacred crop.  
– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** is likely a reference to the **pāo‘o** (a type of fish, often associated with sacred or symbolic significance in Hawaiian lore). The term “māla” (field) and “‘uala” (sweet potato) tie to agricultural practices central to Hawaiian subsistence and rituals.  
• **Puali‘i** (a name) is mentioned as the speaker in a quote, which uses **ulua** (a fish species sacred in *Ai Kapu* rituals) as a metaphor for human sacrifice. The phrase “ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala” (“the head of the ulua in the sweet potato”) suggests a symbolic substitution: the **ulua** (fish) replaces the human head, reflecting the *Ai Kapu* era’s practice of replacing human offerings with agricultural products.  
– **‘Ai Kapu** (sacred food taboos) was a religious system where certain foods were restricted to maintain *mana* (spiritual power). The use of **ulua** as a substitute for human sacrifice (as noted in Pukui & Elbert’s lexicon) highlights the transition from ritualistic violence to sustainable agricultural practices.  
• **Pōka‘ī** (a name) is identified as **Puali‘i**’s wife, and **“me nā mea ‘ē a‘e”** (“and the other things”) may allude to the sacred *ʻōlelo* (language) and *ho‘ohiki* (authority) of the chiefs. The phrase “a laila, noa, ‘ai kāna wahine” (“and now, free, to his wife”) could imply liberation from *Ai Kapu* restrictions, symbolizing a shift toward secular or communal use of resources.  
• **Puali‘i**’s action of “iho akula i kai o Honouliuli e lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala” (“going to the coast of Honouliuli to fish with the sweet potato”) allegorically represents the end of *Ai Kapu* practices. Fishing with the **‘uala** (sweet potato) instead of traditional *i‘a* (fish) or human sacrifices signifies the replacement of ritualistic offerings with agricultural ones, a key theme in Hawaiian history during the decline of the *Ai Kapu* system.  
– **Honouliuli** (a place name) may symbolize a boundary or transition point between sacred and secular life, as it was historically a region associated with both agricultural and spiritual practices.  
• The structure of the paragraph mirrors Hawaiian oral traditions that blend genealogy, place names, and symbolic language to convey moral or historical lessons. The repetition of **“‘ai”** (food) and **“‘uala”** (sweet potato) underscores the crop’s sacredness and its role in cultural transformation.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

They reached the taro patch, as they were with the children, 'Cut the stalks of the taro, leaving none on the surface, so that none may grow.' Therefore, the children were only, but now, the taro is small, no cutting of the stalks.""","**Paragraph 5:**  
• The passage introduces **Puali‘i** (a place or person, likely a name of significance) and **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish), emphasizing the protagonist’s physical and symbolic attributes.  
– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o): The name derives from *maka* (eyes) and *pāo‘o* (a type of fish), symbolizing perception or foresight. This echoes earlier examples where *maka* (eyes) represents both literal vision and metaphorical insight, while *pāo‘o* ties to the sea, suggesting a connection to the ocean or divine guidance.  
– **Kino ‘u‘uku loa** (very large head): The term *kino* (head) here may allude to leadership or spiritual authority, while *‘u‘uku loa* (large) could symbolize power or dominance. The phrase *“twice the usual size of his head”* (*‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e*) might reflect hyperbolic storytelling to highlight Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s extraordinary nature, possibly tied to the **‘Ai Kapu era** (sacred dietary restrictions) where physical traits were often imbued with spiritual meaning.  
• The instruction to **“cut the stalks of the taro, leaving none on the surface, so that none may grow”** (*“E huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala ā pau loa i luna, mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana”*) mirrors agricultural practices in Hawaiian society, where *lau ‘uala* (taro leaves) and *pu‘e* (stalks) were sacred. Destroying these could symbolize the disruption of *mo‘olelo* (history/legacy) or *kula* (ritual).  
– The phrase *“no cutting of the stalks”* (*“‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e”*) may allegorically critique the **‘Ai Kapu system**, which restricted access to certain foods and agricultural practices. Here, the act of cutting stalks could represent the breaking of taboos or the collapse of traditional systems.  
• The paradox of *“the children were only, but now, the taro is small”* (*“Akā, maka‘u nō ua keiki, no laila, kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala, ‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e”*) suggests a reversal of natural order. In Hawaiian cosmology, *‘uala* (taro) is a sacred plant, and its diminishment could symbolize the consequences of defying ancestral practices or the erosion of cultural values.  
– The mention of *“no cutting of the stalks”* might also reference the **māla** (taro patch) as a site of *mo‘okūauā* (sacredness), where *huhuki* (cutting) was a ritual act. The refusal to cut stalks could imply a return to traditional stewardship or a rejection of destructive practices.  
• The numbers *“twice”* (*‘elua*) and *“none”* (*‘a‘ohe*) may carry symbolic weight, akin to the examples where numbers like 2, 4, 40 were used to encode deeper meanings. Here, *‘elua* (two) could signify duality or balance, while *‘a‘ohe* (none) might reflect the void or absence caused by the children’s actions.  
• The narrative’s focus on **taro cultivation** ties to the **‘Ai Kapu era**, where agricultural practices were governed by strict kapu (taboos). The destruction of the *māla ‘uala* (taro patch) by the children could allegorically represent the clash between traditional values and progressive change, or the consequences of hubris in defying divine or societal rules.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

The smallness of the sweet potato fields is the same. Then, he went again to the fire of the ulua (fish) with the four directions of the sweet potato on the top of kapuahi. In that, he is the ulua on the fire. Then, his father, the noble man, went down again, looked upon his mother, to Pōka‘ī: ""No."" Puali‘i said: ""Yes, the head and eyes of the thing that is to be eaten for the sweet potato in this land, therefore, in that time, he made it eat (him).""","**Paragraph 6:**  
• The passage continues the narrative of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish), emphasizing his destructive actions against sweet potato fields, which symbolize the sacred *ai kapu* (sacred restrictions) system. The repetition of ""māla ‘uala"" (sweet potato fields) and ""huhuki ā pau"" (head of the ulua) underscores the symbolic substitution of *ulua* (fish) for human sacrifices in the *ai kapu* era.  
– ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (eyes of the pāo‘o fish) is analyzed in Example 1 as a metaphor for a child with divine or supernatural qualities, but here his actions challenge the sacredness of the land’s resources.  
– The phrase ""i luna o kapuahi e ‘ā ana"" (on the top of kapuahi, which is four) likely refers to a place name (kapuahi) tied to the number four, symbolizing the four directions or the four corners of the earth, a common Hawaiian cosmological concept.  
– ""Pua-li‘i"" (Pua-li‘i) is a name possibly derived from *pua* (flower, blossom) and *li‘i* (to be strong, to grow), suggesting a figure of power or authority, but in this context, he embodies the rigid enforcement of *ai kapu* customs.  
• The father’s threat to ""make it eat him"" (e make ai ia‘u) allegorically represents the *ai kapu* system’s demand for sacrifice, where *ulua* (fish) replaces human offerings. The ""head and eyes"" (po‘o a me nā maka) of the sweet potato (‘uala) symbolize the vital parts of the crop, which were sacred and required ritual protection.  
– ""Pōka‘ī"" (Pōka‘ī) is likely a name meaning ""night falls upon the chief,"" reflecting the mother’s role as a guardian of the land’s resources.  
– The dialogue between Pua-li‘i and Pōka‘ī (""‘A‘ole"" / ""No"" and ""‘Ae"" / ""Yes"") highlights the tension between preserving sacred traditions (*ai kapu*) and the disruptive forces of a new era.  
• The numbers ""‘ehā"" (four) and ""e ‘ā ana"" (which is four) may allude to the four sacred directions (*kūkulu ‘au) in Hawaiian cosmology, reinforcing the idea of completeness and the interconnectedness of the land, its people, and the divine. This ties to the *ai kapu* era’s emphasis on structured, ritualistic control over resources.  
– The destruction of the sweet potato fields by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o symbolizes the collapse of the *ai kapu* system, where the sacred was challenged by the young protagonist’s actions, mirroring historical shifts toward the abolition of *ai kapu* after Kamehameha’s unification of the islands.  
• The phrase ""e make ai ia‘u"" (to make it eat him) is a metaphor for the father’s attempt to reassert control over the sacred by enforcing the old customs, while Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s actions represent the breaking of these restrictions, aligning with the narrative of progressive thinking in Hawaiian tradition.  
– ""Kapuahi"" (kapuahi) is likely a place name, possibly linked to the sacred site of *ai kapu* rituals, where the substitution of *ulua* for human sacrifices occurred. This reflects the historical practice of replacing human offerings with fish to avoid bloodshed, rooted in word magic (*kū‘au*) and the sacredness of *ulua* as a symbol of life and abundance.  
• The allegorical conflict between Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o and Pua-li‘i mirrors the broader struggle between traditionalist and reformist forces in Hawaiian history, particularly during the *ai kapu* era, where rigid social and religious structures were challenged by new ideas.  
– The name ""Pua-li‘i"" may also allude to the concept of *pō* (night, darkness) and *li‘i* (to grow, to strengthen), suggesting a figure who enforces the old ways through fear and control, contrasting with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s disruptive energy.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

The children of all ages knew well, moving to the place of the fisherman for the sake of Puali‘i's fishing. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: 'This is the ko‘ilipi in my hand, a thing of strength for my head on this day, and my head, and the pig and the taro, and eat me first, and then peace.' No one could understand the words of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and then Puali‘i spoke new words, of the two. Puali‘i continued to strengthen Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the ko‘ilipi, at that time to pray for Nāmakaokapāo‘o's death by Puali‘i. Thus, the prayer: 'Only my eyes are for the pāo‘o of my land, O you who are gentle, who are kind, O you who are gentle, who are kind, O you who are hungry, who are thirsty, O you who are thirsty, Nākukui‘aimakaokalani. That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani. This is my place of fishing. Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawaii. O you who are silent, O you who are silent, O you who are silent. Only people and the fish. Only the fish and the pig. Only death for Nāmakaokapāo‘o.'  
""","**Paragraph 7:**  
• This passage continues the narrative of conflict between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, emphasizing ritualistic and symbolic language tied to the *Ai Kapu* era (sacred kapu system). The repetition of phrases like ""e he‘e lā"" (O you who are silent) and ""e hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei"" (O you who are gentle, who are kind) reflects the structure of traditional Hawaiian prayers and chants, which often use parallelism and invocation to deities or natural forces.  
– **""Ko‘ilipi""** (a sacred object or ritual tool) is central here, symbolizing a conduit for spiritual power. Its placement in Puali‘i’s hand and its association with ""strength for my head"" may allude to the *kānaka* (people) and *kūʻau* (trees) in Hawaiian cosmology, where objects like *ko‘ilipi* were used in ceremonies to channel divine energy.  
– **""Nāmakaokapāo‘o""** (the eyes of the *pāo‘o* fish) retains its earlier symbolic role as a child of extraordinary strength, but here it is contrasted with Puali‘i’s actions, suggesting a struggle between human agency and divine or ritualistic authority. The ""four winds"" (*nā ‘au ‘uala āna ‘ehā*) may represent the four directions of the *mo‘olele* (sacred space), underscoring the sacredness of the act of ""carrying"" the child’s strength.  
– **The prayer structure** (""Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o..."") mirrors *mele* (chants) used in *Ai Kapu* rituals, where specific invocations to gods or natural elements were recited to enforce taboos or seek protection. The repetition of ""e he‘e lā"" (O you who are silent) and ""e ‘ai paha, e waiho paha"" (O you who are hungry, who are thirsty) may reflect the dualities of *mana* (spiritual power) and *kūʻike* (sacred duty), with the *pāo‘o* (fish) and *kālua* (pig) as sacred offerings.  
– **""Kukui‘aimakaokalani""** and **""Nākukui‘aimakaokalani""** are likely variations of a place name or deity, with *kukui* (shadow, darkness) and *aimaka* (to make calm) suggesting a connection to the god *Kukui* (associated with rain and darkness) and *Makau* (the *makua* of the land). The phrase ""Only death for Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" may allegorically represent the collapse of *Ai Kapu* traditions, where Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s strength defies the era’s rigid structures.  
• The mention of ""pule make"" (prayer for death) by Puali‘i highlights the tension between human will and divine law. In the *Ai Kapu* era, such prayers could be acts of defiance or attempts to enforce kapu through supernatural means. Puali‘i’s actions here may symbolize the resistance to change, while Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s destructive behavior (from earlier chapters) represents the forward march of progress, undermining *Ai Kapu* practices.  
– The symbolic exchange of ""head"" (*po‘o*) and ""eyes"" (*maka*) in the prayer, replacing *ulua* (fish) as a substitute for human sacrifice, reinforces the allegorical critique of *Ai Kapu* customs. By threatening to ""eat"" Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s ""head"" and ""eyes,"" Puali‘i may be invoking the same wordplay used in *Ai Kapu* to replace human offerings with animals or plants, reflecting the era’s esoteric rituals.  
– The final lines (""Only people and the fish. Only the fish and the pig. Only death..."") may allude to the *mo‘olele* (sacred space) and the *kū‘ike* (sacred duty) of maintaining balance. The exclusion of other elements (e.g., the pig and taro) could symbolize the erasure of traditional practices, while ""death"" represents the consequences of violating kapu.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

Nāmakaokalani is the father and Nāmakaokai‘a is the child. Therefore, they were placed in the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","**Paragraph 8:**  
• This passage follows the traditional Hawaiian storytelling structure of introducing names, their familial roles, and their significance within a cultural or spiritual framework. The phrase “ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki” (In the land of small words) may allude to the concept of “mele” (songs, poetry) or “ʻōlelo” (language) as a sacred medium, with “ane‘i” possibly referencing a specific locality or metaphorical space.  
– **Nāmakaokalani** (Eyes of the heavens): The name combines *nā maka* (eyes) with *ka lani* (the sky/upper realm), suggesting a connection to celestial deities or the spiritual domain.  
– **Nāmakaokai‘a** (Eyes of the fish): The name *i‘a* (fish) ties to oceanic symbolism, while *nā maka* (eyes) may reflect the importance of vision or perception in Hawaiian cosmology.  
– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (Eyes of the pāo‘o): The suffix *pāo‘o* (a type of fish, possibly *Echeneis* or remora) links to the earlier names, creating a triadic relationship. The act of “being placed in the prayer” (*ua komo i loko o ka pule*) could signify ritual inclusion, blessing, or spiritual consecration.  
• The familial relationship (“makua kāne” father, “keiki” child) emphasizes lineage and hierarchy, common in Hawaiian genealogies. Nāmakaokalani as the father and Nāmakaokai‘a as the child may symbolize the transmission of power or divine authority.  
• The reference to “ali‘i nui lāua” (great chiefs of Hawai‘i) highlights their high social status, aligning with the *mo‘okūau* (genealogical lines) of powerful *ali‘i* (chiefs) in Hawaiian history.  
• Allegorically, the repetition of *nā maka* (eyes) in the names may represent the dual focus of *alii* on both the spiritual (*lani*) and material (*i‘a*) realms, reflecting the balance between celestial and earthly domains. The “prayer” (*pule*) could symbolize a ritual act of protection or empowerment, tying the individuals to the divine.  
• The name *pāo‘o* (fish) may also connect to the myth of *Kāne* (god of creation) or *Kāne‘o* (a deity associated with the ocean), suggesting the child’s ties to marine life and ancestral deities.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The head of Puali‘i was placed upon Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hello to you, O Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o also served the head of Puali‘i and the kai of Waipouli, which is in the area of Honouliuli, his loa, five miles the loa.","**Paragraph 9:**  
• This passage describes a ritualistic or symbolic act involving the transfer of sacredness (""‘oi"") and the placement of a ""po‘o"" (head) onto Nāmakaokapāo‘o, reflecting themes of spiritual authority and ancestral connections. The phrase ""e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i iā Puali‘i"" suggests a deliberate act of transferring sacred power from the ""ko‘i"" (possibly a deity or ritual object) to Puali‘i, emphasizing the interplay between human and divine realms.  
• ""Ko‘ilipi"" and ""kai o Waipouli"" are likely place names, with ""kai"" (sea/coast) and ""po‘o"" (head) serving as symbolic markers of sacred geography. ""Honouliuli"" is a known historical region in O‘ahu, linking the narrative to specific Hawaiian cultural landscapes.  
• The dialogue “Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (Hello to you, O Nāmakaokapāo‘o) mirrors traditional Hawaiian greetings that acknowledge both the speaker’s identity and the sacredness of the recipient, possibly signifying a rite of passage or spiritual recognition.  
• The phrase “five miles the loa” may allude to the ""loa"" (sacred or long) as a metaphor for distance or spiritual reach, tying to the concept of *mo‘olele* (distance) in Hawaiian cosmology. It could also reference the *loa* (spirits) in ancestral veneration, where physical proximity (e.g., five miles) symbolizes a boundary between the living and the spiritual.  
• The act of ""pane mai ke po‘o o Puali‘i"" (placing the head of Puali‘i) may allegorically represent the acceptance of responsibility or the embodiment of a deity’s power. In Hawaiian tradition, the ""po‘o"" (head) is a symbol of leadership and divine authority, suggesting Nāmakaokapāo‘o is now spiritually empowered by Puali‘i.  
• The mention of ""kai o Waipouli"" (sea of Waipouli) and ""kahakai o Honouliuli"" (area of Honouliuli) highlights the significance of coastal and valley regions in Hawaiian mythology, often associated with *mo‘okūau* (sacred sites) and ancestral journeys.  
• The structure of the sentence mirrors earlier examples in the text, where names are broken into poetic components (e.g., ""Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" as *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, ""the eyes of the pāo‘o fish""), reinforcing the tradition of *kī‘ōpae* (proverbial expressions) and *mele* (chant) in Hawaiian storytelling.  
• The reference to ""ko‘i"" (possibly a deity or ritual object) and ""po‘o"" (head) may allude to the *Ai Kapu* era’s emphasis on sacred objects and their transfer, where spiritual power was guarded and passed through specific rituals. This could symbolize the collapse of rigid kapu systems, as Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s actions might represent a break from traditional constraints.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

At that time, ‘Ama‘u was the chief of O‘ahu, in Waikīkī where he resided, and he sent someone to Honouliuli from Waikīkī to reside as the chief. He spoke: ""O chief! A little boy who was very strong, his father is dead and his head was cut off in the sea, a very sacred place, five miles the sacred place. And about ‘Ama‘u, his strength and death are with him, therefore, in the place where he dies, there is no strength. He spoke in Waikīkī, the words of Nāmakaokapāo‘o are these.""","**Paragraph 10:** • This paragraph continues the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s story, emphasizing the consequences of his destructive behavior and the sacredness of locations tied to the 'Ai Kapu era, where land and resources were governed by strict rituals; • The names and places include: 1) **Puali‘i** (possibly ""Puli-i,"" meaning ""to take/carry"" or a name with no direct translation); 2) **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (literally ""the eyes of the pāo‘o fish,"" a metaphor for strength, echoing the first example’s ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" as a poetic reference to ""po‘o"" [head]); 3) **Pōka‘ī** (mother’s name; ""pō"" [night] and ""ka‘ī"" [possibly ""to dwell"" or ""to stay,"" suggesting a connection to darkness or secrecy); 4) **‘Ama‘u** (chief of O‘ahu; ""ama"" [to be heavy/oppressive] and ""au"" [suffix], possibly symbolizing authority or burden); 5) **Honouliuli** (a place in O‘ahu, historically significant for its sacred or agricultural role); 6) **Waikīkī** (a place in O‘ahu, central to Hawaiian history and governance).  
– The term **lō‘ihi** (sacred place) reflects the 'Ai Kapu era’s emphasis on *kapu* (sacred restrictions), where certain areas were deemed spiritually potent and required ritual protection. The phrase ""ua kiola ‘ia kona po‘o i kai loa"" (his head was cut off in the sea) may symbolize a severing of spiritual or ancestral ties, with ""kiola"" (to cut off) evoking the concept of *kiola* as a verb for ritualistic dismemberment or metaphorical loss of power.  
– The reference to ""five miles the sacred place"" (‘elima mile ka lō‘ihi) likely uses the number **five** (‘elima) symbolically, as in the first example, to denote a significant distance or esoteric meaning. The repetition of ""lō‘ihi"" (sacred) underscores the sanctity of the location, which in the 'Ai Kapu system, was tied to the *kahiko* (ancient) practices of maintaining balance between human and divine realms.  
– The dialogue ""E ke alii ē! He ‘oi kahi keiki ‘u‘uku ikaika loa..."" (O chief! A little boy who was very strong...) serves as a lament or warning, alluding to the destructive consequences of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s actions. The mention of his father’s death and the sacred place (lō‘ihi) may allegorically represent the collapse of traditional structures, as 'Ai Kapu practices were abandoned, with the chief’s authority (mana) tied to the land’s sacredness.  
– The phrase ""a‘ohe ona ikaika"" (no strength) mirrors the first example’s ""a‘ohe ona ikaika,"" suggesting a thematic link to the loss of power when sacred traditions are disregarded. ‘Ama‘u’s strength and death being inseparable from his place of death (Waikīkī) may allegorically reflect the idea that a chief’s mana (spiritual power) is inseparable from the land they govern, a core concept in Hawaiian cosmology.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",

Then the mother resided there, and then he went to their house in Keahumoa, dwelling there. He was placed on the roof of the house, he was placed in the possession of the god and the sacred place, and dwelled there in peace on the roof of the house.","**Paragraph 11:**  
• The narrative continues to emphasize the protagonist’s (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o) transition from a state of concealment (in the cave of Waipouli) to a new phase of residence under the protection of sacred spaces (Keahumoa, ""roof of the house""). This mirrors the structure of Hawaiian oral traditions where protagonists are often hidden or relocated to sacred or symbolic locations for safety or spiritual training.  
– **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** (the eyes of the pāo’o fish): The name retains its allegorical connection to ""maka"" (eyes) and ""pāo’o"" (a type of fish), symbolizing perception or insight. The ""pāo’o"" here may also evoke the ""po’o"" (head), reinforcing themes of leadership or divine favor.  
– **Waipouli**: A cave or sacred space, possibly linked to ancestral or ritual practices. Caves in Hawaiian lore often represent liminal zones between the physical and spiritual worlds, aligning with the ""hūnā"" (hidden) motif.  
– **Keahumoa**: Translates to ""roof of the house,"" a term that could symbolize a place of authority or divine guardianship. The repetition of ""roof"" (kaupoku) in the text underscores its sacredness, a concept tied to *mo’olelo* (myths) where elevated spaces were reserved for ali’i (nobility) or deities.  
– **Kau’oku (god) and moku (sacred place)**: The phrase ""kaupoku o ka hale"" (roof of the house) and ""moku"" (sacred place) reflects the integration of natural and spiritual realms. In the *’Ai Kapu* era, such spaces were governed by strict kapu (sacred laws), and placing the child here may signify his role as a bridge between human and divine.  
• The act of ""placing him on the roof"" allegorically represents his elevation to a position of spiritual or political significance, contrasting with his earlier destructive behavior. This mirrors the symbolic dismantling of *’Ai Kapu* practices, where sacred spaces were redefined from restrictive to inclusive.  
• The repetition of ""roof"" (kaupoku) may allude to the *mo’olelo* of *Kahiko* (ancient) traditions, where the roof symbolized the connection between earth and sky, and the child’s residence there signifies his alignment with higher powers.","Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

He alone was in the house of his father, Puali'i.'""","• This paragraph continues the narrative of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, emphasizing his role as a figure of contrast between traditional and progressive values. The mention of ""Kaua"" (Kaua Island) and ""Waikīkī"" (a district in Honolulu) situates the story in a specific geographic and cultural context. The phrase ""kula o Keahumoa"" (field of Keahumoa) may reference a sacred or ritual site, aligning with the 'Ai Kapu era's emphasis on land and spiritual boundaries.  
– The repetition of ""Ehā ma ke kua o ka hale"" (Ehā at the head of the house) and ""alo o ka hale"" (head of the house) could symbolize the tension between communal leadership and individual authority, reflecting the hierarchical structure of Hawaiian society.  
– ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o"" (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) is analyzed in prior examples as a metaphor for a child with symbolic ""eyes"" (maka) representing knowledge or vision. Here, the ""head"" (kua) of the house (hale) may allude to the physical and spiritual center of a household, where decisions were made.  
• The dialogue ""He aha mai nei kā 'oukou o 'one'i?"" (""What is this that you are looking for?"") echoes the theme of questioning traditional practices, a common motif in Hawaiian narratives during the 'Ai Kapu era, where rituals and taboos were scrutinized.  
– ""Wahi keiki 'u'uku e like me 'oe"" (""a place of small children like you"") may allegorically represent the younger generation challenging the old guard, with ""keiki"" (children) symbolizing future leaders and ""u'uku"" (a type of fish) possibly tied to ancestral deities.  
– ""Puali'i"" (father) is likely a reference to a deity or high priest, as ""pua"" (flower) and ""li'i"" (lineage) often denote sacred or royal heritage. The phrase ""he ikaika a me ke koa loa"" (""strong and mighty"") underscores Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's unique status as both a child and a symbol of power.  
• The structure of the paragraph mirrors earlier examples, with a focus on naming conventions, geographic specificity, and symbolic conflict between human and divine forces. The absence of people in the house (""a'ohe kanaka"") may reflect the collapse of traditional structures or the isolation of a visionary.","Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, ""Where is that voice coming from?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I'm up here."" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""What in the world are you all doing here?"" They said, ""We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave.

• This passage reflects a critical turning point in the narrative, where Nāmakaokapāo'o confronts a group of people who accuse him of being a threat, symbolizing the tension between tradition and emerging power dynamics during the *Ai Kapu* era.  
– The dialogue highlights the protagonist’s defiance and the stakes of his actions, with ""e make ana 'oe iā mākou"" (""you will kill us"") underscoring the fatalism of the time, where *Ai Kapu* restrictions often framed human actions as tied to divine will.  
– ""Pua-li'i"" (likely *Pua-lākou*, ""the one who seizes"" or ""the one who takes"") is a figure associated with the dead, possibly a guardian of the *moʻo* (spiritual realm) or a symbol of the *Ai Kapu* system’s enforcement.  
– ""Ama'u"" (a name possibly linked to *amaʻu*, ""to be still"" or ""to rest"") in *Waikīkī* may reference a sacred space or a metaphor for the afterlife, emphasizing the story’s connection to *moʻolele* (myths) and the spiritual journey of the protagonist.  
– The phrase ""e hakakā ai"" (""to fight"") ties to the *kāne* (male) warrior ethos, contrasting with earlier depictions of Nāmakaokapāo'o as a child of ""kanaka nui"" (great man) and ""pela ko makou lohe"" (like our words), suggesting a shift from passive description to active confrontation.  
• Allegorically, the ""one man"" (*koe aku ho'okahi kanaka*) may represent the individual’s struggle against collective *kapu* (taboos), reflecting the collapse of the *Ai Kapu* system and the rise of new social orders.","Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him."" The soldiers said, ""No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive."" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""Well, let's go down and fight."" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

• The passage introduces **'Ama'u (m)**, a warrior leader, and his conflict with **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (m)** (the eyes of the pāo'o fish), emphasizing their roles in a battle over land and resources. 'Ama'u’s actions—leading war canoes (*wa'a kaua*) and targeting Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o—reflect tensions between traditional power structures and emerging challenges.  
– **'Ama'u** is likely a name or title, possibly derived from *ama* (to strike, to attack) and *u* (a suffix indicating a place or person), suggesting a ""warrior of attack"" or ""aggressor.""  
– The phrase *e noke mai ana 'o Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o* (""to destroy Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o"") uses *noke* (to destroy) and *maka* (eyes), symbolizing the erasure of a cultural or spiritual legacy tied to the *pāo'o* fish, which in Hawaiian tradition often represents protection or sacredness. This mirrors the example’s allegory of challenging *Ai Kapu* (sacred laws) by disrupting symbolic resources.  
• **Ewa** (a district on O'ahu) and **O'ahu nei** (this O'ahu) are specified as the locations, grounding the narrative in a specific geographic and political context. The reference to *kula* (to fight, to battle) underscores the militaristic stakes.  
– **'Ama'u’s** threat to ""destroy the whole land"" (*luku ā pau loa*) may allegorically represent the collapse of traditional systems (*Ai Kapu*) through overexploitation or defiance, while *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o* symbolizes the sacredness of the land’s resources.  
• The line *a make ihola 'o 'Ama'u* (""and 'Ama'u became a warrior"") highlights the transformation of 'Ama'u into a warrior figure, possibly reflecting the rise of a new power structure or the rejection of old hierarchies.  
– The phrase *ki'i akula ia i kona makuahine* (""a symbol of his mother"") links 'Ama'u to his mother, suggesting a connection to ancestral or spiritual lineage. This may allude to the *makuahine* (mother) as a symbol of the land’s fertility or the *moʻolelo* (history) of O'ahu.  
• The narrative context ties to the **'Ai Kapu era** (sacred laws), where certain lands and resources were protected. 'Ama'u’s actions could symbolize the disruption of these laws, while Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s legacy represents the traditional guardianship of the land.  
– The conflict between 'Ama'u and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may allegorically reflect the tension between *kupuna* (elders) and *maoli* (new generations) during the transition from *Ai Kapu* to Western-influenced practices.","When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
