Pōka'ī was his mother. His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he was a demigod.","• **Paragraph 1:**  
  – **Character introduction and cultural framing:** The passage begins by establishing Nāmakaokapāo'o as a child of exceptional strength and small stature, emphasizing his uniqueness across the islands of Hawaiʻi and Niʻihau. This mirrors the structure of Example 1, where protagonists are introduced with their names, physical traits, and origins.  
  – **Name etymology and symbolism:**  
    – *Nāmakaokapāoʻo* (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo): ""Eyes of the pāoʻo fish"" (pāoʻo is a type of fish; ""maka"" means eyes). This name reflects the cultural practice of linking individuals to natural elements or deities, often symbolizing their connection to resources or spiritual power.  
    – *Kauluakahaʻi* (Kau-lu-a-kahaʻi): ""The inspiration of Kahaʻi"" (Kahaʻi is a legendary figure associated with bringing breadfruit to Hawaii, as noted in Example 1). The name suggests a lineage tied to mythic heroes, reinforcing Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s cultural significance.  
    – *Kahikipapaialewa* (Kahiki-papa-ia-lewa): ""The stratum of the chief in the sky"" (Kahiki refers to foreign lands, ""papa"" as a poetic term for ""sky"" or ""heaven,"" and ""ia-lewa"" as a directional phrase). This place name may allegorically represent a connection to the divine or ancestral realms, reflecting the blending of mortal and spiritual worlds in Hawaiian cosmology.  
    – *Kahikinuʻu* (Kahiki at the summit): A foreign land (Kahiki) associated with ""nuʻu"" (summit, height), possibly symbolizing a place of power or sacredness.  
  – **Cultural context of 'Ai Kapu era:** The reference to ""Kahikipapaialewa"" and ""Kahikinuʻu"" aligns with the 'Ai Kapu (sacred food taboo) period, where specific lands or regions were tied to rituals and divine authority. The phrase ""he aliʻi nui kona makua kāne"" (his father was a high chief) underscores the hereditary hierarchy of the time, where chiefs (aliʻi) held both political and spiritual power.  
  – **Allegorical interpretation:** Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s description as ""small in stature but strong"" may symbolize the tension between traditional values (strength, resilience) and the challenges of a changing world. His father’s status as a demigod (""aoʻao akua"") highlights the divine ancestry common to many Hawaiian heroes, linking them to the gods (akua) and legitimizing their authority.  
  – **Geographic specificity:** The mention of ""Kahikipapaialewa"" and ""Kahikinuʻu"" reflects the importance of precise place names in Hawaiian storytelling, often tied to ancestral lands or sacred sites. These names may also allude to the concept of *moku* (districts) and *āina* (land), emphasizing territorial and cultural identity.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","The chapter introduces the mythological figure Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a boy of extraordinary strength and courage, whose narrative intertwines elements of Hawaiian cosmology, social hierarchy, and agricultural symbolism. Central to the story is the interplay between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and Puali‘i, a figure associated with the sacred and the supernatural. The text establishes Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s lineage, noting his father Kauluakaha‘i, a high chief from Kahikipapaialewa, and his mother Pōka‘ī, who adopts him, reflecting traditional practices of kinship and spiritual inheritance. The story’s setting—Ewa, Hōaeae, Honouliuli, Keahumoa, and Waipouli—anchors it in specific Hawaiian landscapes, emphasizing the cultural and geographical specificity of the narrative. These locations, tied to historical and mythological contexts, serve as both physical and symbolic spaces for conflict and transformation.

The allegorical dimensions of the story are evident in its portrayal of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a heroic archetype, embodying superhuman strength and resilience, while Puali‘i and 'Ama‘u represent opposing forces, including the supernatural and the warrior ethos. The ritualistic elements, such as the heiau (sacred temple) and the ko‘ilipi (ritual food), underscore the spiritual and cultural practices of the 'Ai Kapu era, a period of strict social and religious customs in pre-modern Hawai‘i. The prayer in paragraph 7, invoking deities and ancestral names like Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, highlights the integration of mythic figures into the narrative, suggesting a cosmological framework where power and identity are mediated through ritual and divine favor. The destruction of sweet potato patches and the emphasis on their cultivation (as in paragraph 5) symbolize the struggle for control over vital resources, a recurring theme in Hawaiian lore tied to both survival and spiritual authority.

The temporal context of the story is ambiguous but its cultural resonance is clear. While the example chapter references 1894 and 1917 newspaper publications, this passage appears rooted in pre-colonial mythology, with its focus on sacred sites and ancestral figures. However, its later transmission through newspapers might reflect post-1893 political agendas, as seen in the example, where stories were repurposed to align with Western or annexationist narratives. The portrayal of 'Ama‘u, a chief known for his strong canoes, and the conflict over sweet potato patches may allegorically critique power dynamics, with Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s dominance symbolizing resistance or the assertion of indigenous strength against external forces. The text’s emphasis on Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s solitary heroism and the marginalization of other characters (e.g., the absent female agents) mirrors broader themes of patriarchal authority and the valorization of male warriors, a common trope in Hawaiian oral traditions.

This chapter holds significance in Hawaiian literature as a preservation of pre-colonial mythic structures, blending genealogy, ritual, and conflict. Its synthesis of archetypal figures and symbolic acts (e.g., casting Puali‘i’s head into the sea) reflects a narrative strategy to encode cultural values and historical memory. The political implications, while not explicitly stated here, may align with the example’s analysis of post-1893 narratives designed to justify colonial agendas by reinforcing Western ideals of strength and hierarchy. The story’s emphasis on Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s invincibility and the erasure of opposing figures could allegorically support narratives of indigenous resilience or, conversely, serve as a tool to legitimize dominant power structures, depending on its historical reception. The synthesis of these elements reveals a tale that is both a cultural artifact and a potential vehicle for ideological interpretation, reflecting the complexities of Hawaiian identity and resistance during periods of colonial encroachment."

Pōka‘ī adopted Nāmakaokapāo‘o, then Kauluakaha‘i came to her land, resided with Pōka‘ī and her adoptive child, and then was born. In this birth, Pōka‘ī was very pregnant and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","**Paragraph 2:**  
• This paragraph introduces the geographical and familial context of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s early life, emphasizing the interconnectedness of land, lineage, and cultural practices;  
– **Hōaeae (place name):** A specific location in Ewa, O‘ahu, highlighting the importance of place-based identity in Hawaiian narratives;  
– **‘Āina (land):** Refers to the ancestral territory, underscoring the sacred relationship between people and their homeland;  
• The adoption of Nāmakaokapāo‘o by Pōka‘ī is a critical event, reflecting the cultural practice of *ʻōlelo kū'oko'a* (independent naming) and *kūpuna* (elders) as caregivers, which was central to Hawaiian social structures before the 'Ai Kapu era;  
– **Pōka‘ī (f):** Her name may derive from *pō* (night) and *ka‘ī* (to fall, to descend), suggesting a metaphorical link to the cyclical nature of life and death, or the ""night of the chief,"" aligning with themes of ancestral guardianship;  
– **Kauluakaha‘i (m):** His name combines *kau* (to extend, to stretch) and *luakaha‘i* (a poetic form of *kaha‘i*, a hero from earlier stories). This may symbolize his role as a bridge between generations or a figure of authority;  
• The phrase ""a hāpai ‘o Pōka‘ī iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" (Pōka‘ī adopted Nāmakaokapāo‘o) reflects the *kūʻike* (to raise, to nurture) tradition, where children were formally adopted to ensure lineage continuity and spiritual protection;  
– **Kāne (father) and wahine (mother):** The names Pōka‘ī and Kauluakaha‘i are linked to parental roles, with Kauluakaha‘i as the biological father (as per earlier context) and Pōka‘ī as the adoptive mother, illustrating the fluidity of familial ties in Hawaiian culture;  
• The mention of Kauluakaha‘i coming to Pōka‘ī’s land and residing with her and her adoptive child suggests a *kula* (ritual or communal) connection, reinforcing the idea of shared responsibility and *ʻāina* (land) as a unifying force;  
– **Noho ihola (to reside with):** Implies a temporary or permanent integration into a family, reflecting the *ho'okupu* (to plant, to establish) metaphor for fostering relationships;  
• The final line, ""Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o,"" (In this birth, Pōka‘ī was very pregnant and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o) may allegorically represent the tension between *ʻāina* (land) and *kūʻike* (nurturing), symbolizing the struggle between traditional practices and the emergence of new cultural paradigms during the transition from the 'Ai Kapu era to a more secularized society;  
– **‘Ilima (pregnant):** The term ""‘ilihune"" (pregnant) here may allude to the *mākua* (child) as a sacred entity, tied to the *kūpuna* (elders) who guided *kūʻike* (nurturing) through rituals and spiritual connections;  
– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s name:** ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish), a poetic reference to *maka* (eyes) and *pāo‘o* (a type of fish), symbolizing perception and resourcefulness, traits central to Hawaiian navigators and leaders. This ties to the allegorical theme of survival and adaptation in the face of cultural change.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

• This passage introduces **Pua-li'i (Puali'i)**, a ""good man"" (kanaka maika'i) from **Līhu'e (Wāhiāwā)**, and **Pōka'ī**, a woman described as having a child and a ""ruined"" body (ua 'ino'ino ko'u kino). The narrative follows the conventions of Hawaiian storytelling, where characters are introduced with their origins, relationships, and cultural contexts;  
– **Pua-li'i** (likely ""Pua"" as a prefix denoting a child or descendant, and ""li'i"" as a name) is positioned as a suitor, arriving from inland (iho maila) to **Honouliuli (dark bay)** in **'Ewa**. His visit to **Pōka'ī's** home reflects the **'Ai Kapu era** practice of hospitality, where strangers were welcomed and offered food, a custom rooted in the reverence for **mana** (spiritual power) and communal responsibility;  
– **Pōka'ī** (possibly ""Pō"" [night] + ""ka'ī"" [a name]) is portrayed as a woman with a child, suggesting she may be a widow or a mother in a society where **kūpuna** (elders) or **mo'okū'auhau** (genealogical lineage) were central to social structure. Her hesitation (""Pehea ‘oe e makemake ai ia‘u?"") stems from the belief that a woman with a child and ""ruined"" body (ua 'ino'ino) might be spiritually or socially constrained, a concept tied to **'Ai Kapu** restrictions on certain activities or relationships;  
• The dialogue between Pua-li'i and Pōka'ī highlights the tension between **traditional values** and **individual agency**. Pua-li'i's insistence (""He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua"") reflects a shift toward **moe kāua** (cohabitation), which in the **'Ai Kapu era** could symbolize a challenge to rigid taboos, as **'Ai Kapu** (sacred eating) emphasized communal rituals and restrictions. However, here the phrase ""e moe kāua"" (let's sleep together) may allude to **mahi** (work) and **ho'okipa** (hospitality) as foundational to relationships, even in the face of cultural norms;  
• The relocation to **Keahumoa (heap of chickens)** in **Līhu'e** underscores the symbolic importance of **'āina** (land) and **kuleana** (responsibility). Keahumoa, a place name, may reference the **māla (garden)** practices of the **'Ai Kapu era**, where land was cultivated collectively. Pōka'ī's decision to move with Pua-li'i signifies a **kū'ula (honor)** in accepting a partner despite societal stigma, aligning with the **mālama 'āina** (caring for the land) ethos;  
• The phrase **""ua 'ino'ino ko'u kino""** (""my body is ruined"") may allude to **kūpā (sacredness)** and **kū'ike (transgression)**, suggesting Pōka'ī's self-perception as spiritually or socially compromised. Pua-li'i's dismissal of this (""He mea ‘ole ia mau mea"") reflects a **mālama 'āina** approach, prioritizing **lā'au (healing)** and **ho'okipa** over rigid taboos, a theme seen in stories where **kāne (men)** and **wahine (women)** transcend **'Ai Kapu** restrictions to form new kinship bonds;  
• The structure of the paragraph mirrors **Hawaiian oral traditions** where **kāne** and **wahine** are introduced through their actions and relationships, emphasizing **ho'okipa** (hospitality) and **kōkua** (helping) as central to cultural identity. Pua-li'i's proposal and Pōka'ī's acceptance also highlight the **mālama pū (care for the people)** principle, where individuals are valued beyond their physical state.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

When the sweet potato was ripe, Puali'i spoke in his own language of the heiau, saying, ""This is the head of the ulua and the sweet potato, which is Puali'i's. Then, now, eat his wife, Pōka'ī, and the other things. Therefore, Puali'i went to the shore of Honouliuli to fish with the sweet potato.""","**Paragraph 4:**  
• The narrative introduces Puali'i's actions during the ripening of the sweet potato (‘uala), emphasizing ritual and symbolic exchange. The phrase ""iho akula ‘o Puali‘i i kai o Honouliuli e lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala"" (Puali'i went to the shore of Honouliuli to fish with the sweet potato) reflects the integration of agricultural and ritual practices, where the sweet potato (‘uala) is both a staple crop and a sacred offering. – ""Kālua"" in ""kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala"" is a term with dual meanings: 1) a type of sweet potato (Pukui & Elbert 1986: 369: *kālua* – ""a kind of sweet potato""), and 2) a poetic reference to ""heiau"" (temple), as *kālua* can also mean ""to be set apart"" or ""sacred."" This duality underscores the sacredness of the crop and its connection to ritual.  
• Puali'i’s statement ""Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala"" (This is the head of the ulua and the sweet potato) alludes to the *Ai Kapu* era, where *ulua* (fish) was symbolically substituted for human sacrifices. Here, the sweet potato (‘uala) replaces *ulua*, reflecting a shift in ritual practices. The phrase ""po‘o o ka ulua"" (head of the ulua) may metaphorically refer to the *po‘o* (head) of a chief, linking the crop to the concept of *makua* (children) and *kūʻike* (sacredness).  
• The act of ""‘ai kāna wahine, Pōka‘ī a me nā mea ‘ē a‘e"" (eat his wife, Pōka'ī, and the other things) is allegorical, representing the destruction of traditional values or the severing of familial ties. Pōka'ī, as Nāmakaokapāo'o’s mother, symbolizes the *moʻokūauhau* (lineage) and the *ʻōlelo hoʻohiki* (sacred language) of the heiau. This mirrors the earlier conflict between Puali'i’s adherence to *Ai Kapu* and Nāmakaokapāo'o’s progressive defiance.  
• The movement to *kai o Honouliuli* (shore of Honouliuli) ties to the *kula* (circle, ritual) and *moa* (chickens), suggesting a symbolic reorientation from *Keahumoa* (the plains of Keahumoa) to a new location. This reflects the story’s theme of cultural transition, where Puali'i’s actions represent clinging to old traditions, while Nāmakaokapāo'o’s earlier destruction of sweet potato patches symbolizes breaking from *Ai Kapu* practices.  
• The repetition of ""iho akula"" (went to) and ""kai"" (shore) highlights the importance of *moʻolelo* (stories) as spatial and temporal anchors. Honouliuli, a place associated with *kūʻike* (sacredness) and *hoʻi* (return), becomes a site of conflict between Puali'i’s ritualistic demands and Nāmakaokapāo'o’s rebellious growth, allegorically representing the tension between *kapu* (sacred restrictions) and *alaka‘i* (leadership, innovation).","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

When they arrived at the sweet potato patches, as with the children, ""Pull out the roots and the leaves entirely from the surface, so that nothing grows."" Therefore, the children were only the ones, so that, in the sweet potato, there was no pulling of the roots.","**Paragraph 5:**  
• The passage introduces a conflict between Puali'i and Nāmakaokapāo'o, emphasizing agricultural practices and symbolic violence. Nāmakaokapāo'o is described as a child with a ""kino ‘u‘uku loa"" (very large head), which may allegorically represent an overreliance on tradition or rigid structures, contrasting with Puali'i’s role as a figure upholding ""Ai Kapu"" (sacred dietary laws). The ""two wounds from the thorns of the sweet potato vine"" (‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e) symbolize the physical and spiritual toll of sustaining ""Ai Kapu"" rituals, where sweet potato cultivation was both a practical and sacred act.  
• The phrase ""e huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala ā pau loa i luna, mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana"" (pull out the roots and the leaves entirely from the surface, so that nothing grows) reflects a radical act of severing agricultural ties, possibly alluding to the dismantling of ""Ai Kapu"" practices. This mirrors the earlier example where Nāmakaokapāo'o destroyed sweet potato patches, symbolizing a break from ritualized restrictions. The ""pu‘e"" (roots) and ""lau ‘uala"" (leaves) are central to sweet potato cultivation, and their destruction here could represent a rejection of the sacred system that governed such labor.  
• ""Kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala, ‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e"" (in the sweet potato, there was no pulling of the roots) suggests a shift in agricultural methodology. The ""kāohi mālie"" (only the children) may imply a generational divide, where younger generations (like Nāmakaokapāo'o) abandon traditional practices (e.g., ""Ai Kapu"" restrictions on harvesting), while older figures (Puali'i) cling to them. This aligns with the broader narrative of progressive vs. conservative forces in Hawaiian history, where ""Ai Kapu"" era customs were challenged by new ideas.  
• The names carry symbolic weight:  
– **Nāmakaokapāo'o** (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o): ""Maka"" (eyes) and ""pāo'o"" (a type of fish, often associated with strength or leadership). The name could signify a child of ""pāo'o"" (fish), metaphorically tied to the ""Ai Kapu"" era’s reliance on fish as a sacred resource.  
– **Puali'i** (Pua-li'i): ""Pua"" (child, blossom) and ""li'i"" (to grow, cultivate). The name may reflect his role as a cultivator of both land and tradition, contrasting with Nāmakaokapāo'o’s destructive actions.  
• The act of ""huhuki"" (pulling out roots) is a ritualized agricultural practice in ""Ai Kapu"" culture, where sweet potato farming was tied to kapu (sacred laws) and spiritual offerings. Nāmakaokapāo'o’s defiance of this practice—destroying the patches without restraint—symbolizes a rupture with ancestral customs, akin to the earlier example where his father’s rage against the ""Ai Kapu"" system led to threats of violence. This passage underscores the tension between preserving sacred agricultural traditions and the rise of more secular, progressive practices.  
• The mention of ""kāne"" (man) and ""wahine"" (woman) in the context of ""keiki"" (children) highlights the societal structure of the ""Ai Kapu"" era, where children were central to both labor and spiritual roles. The dialogue between Puali'i and the children, though not explicitly stated here, may echo the earlier example’s emphasis on reciprocal hospitality and the moral obligations of the time.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

• The destruction of the sweet potato patches (māla ‘uala) by Nāmakaokapāo‘o symbolizes a rejection of traditional agricultural practices and the 'Ai Kapu era’s restrictions on food production. The act of ""huhuki ā pau"" (tearing apart completely) and ""ōhinu akula ‘ehā ‘au o ka ‘uala"" (broiling four sweet potato vines) reflects a deliberate dismantling of sacred systems, possibly allegorizing the end of ritualized land use.  
– ""Kū ke āhua o ka lau o ka ‘uala"" (the appearance of the leaves of the sweet potato) ties to the concept of *lau* (leaves) as a metaphor for knowledge or spiritual energy, suggesting Nāmakaokapāo‘o severs the connection between the people and their sacred agricultural traditions.  
• The numbers ""2, 4, 40"" in the text hold symbolic weight:  
– ""Kekahi māla ‘uala ā luna o kekahi māla ‘uala"" (one sweet potato patch on top of another) may reference the dualities of Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., *mo‘o* [duality] and *‘elua* [two]), while ""40 māla ‘elua"" (forty sweet potato patches) could allude to the *kūmū* (forty) as a sacred number in Hawaiian ritual, signifying a complete or cyclical ending.  
– The ""four sweet potato vines"" (ōhinu akula ‘ehā ‘au o ka ‘uala) might parallel the *four directions* (kūhai) or *four sacred sites* (kūhā) in Hawaiian navigation and spirituality, emphasizing a ritualistic act of destruction.  
• Puali'ī’s threat to ""make ai ia'u"" (kill him) using ""ke po‘o ona a me nā maka ka mea e ‘īna'i ai ku'u ‘uala"" (his head and eyes as food to go with the sweet potato) is a reversal of the *Ai Kapu* practice where *ulua* (fish) replaced human sacrifice.  
– ""Po‘o"" (head) and ""maka"" (eyes) here have dual meanings:  
  – *Physical parts*: Symbolizing the annihilation of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a child who embodies the old order.  
  – *Agricultural terms*: ""Maka"" as the ""eyes"" of the sweet potato vine (cuttings used for replanting), implying the destruction of future growth.  
– ""Ke po‘o ona"" (his head) and ""nā maka"" (eyes) are poetic references to *pāo‘o* (a type of fish) and *maka* (eyes), linking to the name *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (""the eyes of the pāo‘o fish""), suggesting a metaphorical substitution of the child’s vitality for the sacred *ulua*.  
• The dialogue between Puali'ī and Pōka'ī highlights the clash between traditional values and progressive defiance:  
– Pōka'ī’s refusal (""‘A‘ole"") reflects the *Ai Kapu* era’s emphasis on preserving sacred resources, while Puali'ī’s insistence (""‘Ae"") mirrors the rigid enforcement of rituals.  
– The phrase ""eia kona lā e make ai ia'u"" (""so, today I will kill him"") underscores the fatalism of the *Ai Kapu* system, where human actions were dictated by divine mandates.  
• Cultural context:  
– The *Ai Kapu* era (sacred eating) prohibited certain foods and activities, but the substitution of *ulua* for human sacrifice (as noted in Pukui & Elbert 1986:369) highlights the fluidity of ritual symbolism. Here, Puali'ī’s threat to eat Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s ""head and eyes"" subverts this practice, symbolizing a return to older, more destructive traditions.  
– The act of broiling sweet potato vines (ōhinu) in a fire pit (kapuahi) may allude to the *heiau* (sacred temples) where offerings were made, but Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s actions here are profane, disrupting the sacred.  
• Allegorical interpretation:  
– Nāmakaokapāo‘o represents the future, breaking from the past’s rigid structures, while Puali'ī embodies the old order clinging to ritual. The destruction of the patches (māla) and the threat to ""kill"" the child symbolize the collapse of *Ai Kapu* and the rise of secular, agricultural innovation.  
– The name *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o) is etymologically tied to *pāo‘o* (a type of fish), reinforcing the theme of substitution—*ulua* (fish) as a stand-in for human sacrifice, and *pāo‘o* as a metaphor for the child’s role in this symbolic exchange.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

He knew all the children, and they were all gathered at a resting place for Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! This ko‘ilipi in my hand, it is a man’s food for my head today, and my head, and then, the pig with the sweet potato, and eat me first, then, free.” No one else heard the words of Puali‘i, and then, the words of Puali‘i, the two of them. Puali‘i continued to eat Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s ko‘ilipi, at that time, he prayed to Nāmakaokapāo‘o for his prayer to be made by Puali‘i. Thus the prayer: “Only my eyes of pāo‘o (fish) are dear to me. Let the ripe (fruit) be, let the ripe (fruit) be here. Let the pig be, let the pig be. Let the pig be here, Nākukui‘aimakaokalani. O Kukui‘aimakaokalani is that. O my dear place is this. O Nāmakaokai‘a, the high chief of Hawai‘i. Let the ripe (fruit) be, let the ripe (fruit) be. Only people with the ihe (ritual object), only the ihe with the pahu (ritual vessel). Only Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”","**Paragraph 7:**  
• This passage describes a ritualistic act of Puali‘i consuming ko‘ilipi (a type of fish or symbolic offering) and engaging in a prayer to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, reflecting the **'Ai Kapu era** (sacred eating period) where offerings and prayers were central to maintaining spiritual balance and ensuring prosperity;  
– **Ko‘ilipi** (ko‘ilipi): A fish species, possibly linked to **'Ai Kapu** practices where specific foods were offered to gods. Its destruction by Nāmakaokapāo‘o may symbolize a challenge to traditional rituals;  
– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o): The name translates to “the eyes of the pāo‘o fish” (pāo‘o meaning “fish” or “a fish’s head,” with **maka** (eyes) as a poetic metaphor. This ties to the **'Ai Kapu** tradition, where symbolic substitutions like **ulua** (fish) replaced human sacrifices;  
• The phrase “tearing apart the sweet potato patches, four in all, on the fire” highlights **agricultural symbolism** and the **destruction of sacred resources**, which could allegorically represent the **abandonment of 'Ai Kapu restrictions** or the **defiance of cultural taboos**;  
– **‘Au ‘uala** (sweet potato): A staple crop in Hawaiian society, often central to rituals. Its “tearing apart” may signify **wastefulness** or **rejection of traditional agricultural practices**;  
– **Four (āna ‘ehā)**: A numerical symbol in Hawaiian lore, often representing **completeness** or **sacred cycles**, but here it may underscore the **magnitude of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s destructive actions**;  
• The prayer structure mirrors **traditional Hawaiian oli (chant)** or **kīoleo (incantation)**, where invocations to deities or ancestors were used to seek protection, abundance, or legitimacy;  
– **“Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o”**: A plea for **protection of the pāo‘o fish’s eyes**, possibly symbolizing **sacred knowledge** or **spiritual insight**;  
– **“E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei”**: A call for **ripeness** and **harvest**, reflecting the **agricultural cycle** and the importance of **seasonal rituals**;  
– **“E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha”**: Repeated invocations for **sacrificial offerings** (pigs, sweet potatoes), aligning with **'Ai Kapu** practices where animals and crops were offered to gods;  
• The names **Nākukui‘aimakaokalani**, **Kukui‘aimakaokalani**, and **Nāmakaokai‘a** (high chief of Hawai‘i) suggest **genealogical ties** to deities or ancestors, reinforcing the **sacred authority** of Puali‘i’s actions;  
– **Kukui** (light, guide): A name often associated with **ancestral deities** (e.g., Kukui, the god of light). **Aimakaokalani** (ai-maka-o-ka-lani): “the eyes of the sky” or “the eyes of the heavens,” possibly symbolizing **divine vision** or **celestial connection**;  
– **Nākukui** (nā-ku-mui): “the light of the sky” or “the sacred light,” emphasizing **spiritual power** in the prayer;  
• The repetition of “e he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale” (let the ripe be, let the ripe be) reflects **ritualistic formulae** used to **sanctify offerings** or **invoke abundance**, a common feature in **Hawaiian religious practices**;  
– **“Ihe”** (ritual object) and **“pahu”** (ritual vessel) may refer to **sacred tools** used in **'Ai Kapu ceremonies**, where offerings were prepared and presented;  
• The final line “Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (Only Nāmakaokapāo‘o) underscores the **exclusive focus on Nāmakaokapāo‘o** as the central figure, possibly symbolizing **the rejection of other deities or practices** in favor of his authority or legacy.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","At that time, the names of those two, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, were great chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani is the father and Nāmakaokai‘a is the child. Therefore, they were incorporated into the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","**Paragraph 8:**  
• This passage introduces two names, **Nā-maka-o-ka-lani** (the eyes of the chief) and **Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a** (the eyes of the fish), as **ali‘i nui** (great chiefs) of Hawai‘i, establishing their status and familial relationship;  
– **Nāmakaokalani** (Nā-maka-o-ka-lani): The term *nā maka* (eyes) here is linked to *maka* (to see, to look), but also to *maka* as a poetic reference to *ulua* (fish), reflecting the cultural practice of substituting *ulua* for human sacrifices in *‘Ai Kapu* rituals (Pukui & Elbert 1986:369). The *lani* (chief) here may allude to the sacredness of leadership in Hawaiian society;  
– **Nāmakaokai‘a** (Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a): *I‘a* (fish) is a central element in Hawaiian cosmology, often symbolizing abundance and spiritual connection. The name may also reference the *‘Ai Kapu* practice of using fish as offerings, contrasting with the earlier era’s human sacrifices;  
• The phrase **“he makua kāne ‘o Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a”** (Nāmakaokalani is the father and Nāmakaokai‘a is the child) reflects a common narrative structure in Hawaiian lore, where familial roles and relationships are tied to mythic or historical contexts;  
– The use of *makua kāne* (father) and *keiki* (child) emphasizes generational hierarchy, a key aspect of *ʻapanaʻi* (ancestral lineage) in Hawaiian tradition;  
• The final clause **“akā, ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o”** (therefore, they were incorporated into the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o) suggests ritualistic or mythic integration, where individuals are spiritually enmeshed in sacred practices;  
– *Komo* (to be incorporated) here may reference the act of *komo* (to lie down, to rest) in a spiritual sense, as seen in *heiau* (temples) where offerings were placed. *Pule* (prayer) in this context could allude to the *‘Ai Kapu* era’s emphasis on sacred speech and ritual invocations;  
– The name **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o** (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish) from earlier examples is likely connected, as this passage may foreshadow the conflict between *Nāmakaokalani* (father) and *Nāmakaokai‘a* (child) with *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (the main protagonist), symbolizing the tension between tradition and transformation;  
• Allegorically, the inclusion of these names in a prayer may represent the cyclical nature of Hawaiian cosmology, where ancestral figures are perpetually linked to the land and its resources. The *‘Ai Kapu* system, which governed sacred practices, often required such symbolic associations to maintain balance between humans and the divine;  
– The repetition of *nā maka* (eyes) in multiple names may allude to the concept of *maka* (to see) as a metaphor for wisdom or spiritual insight, contrasting with the destructive behavior of *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* in earlier paragraphs, who tore apart sweet potato patches;  
– The phrase *“kāne”* (man) and *“wahine”* (woman) in the names may reflect the gendered roles in *‘Ai Kapu*—*kāne* as warriors and *wahine* as those under sacred protection, though this passage focuses on *kāne* (father) and *keiki* (child), suggesting a lineage tied to both spiritual and earthly authority.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i.

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

At that time, Puali'i was seeking the prayer from Nāmakaokapāo'o's head, to reverse the eyes of the ko'i of Puali'i, the head, and speak from another place. The head of Puali'i came to Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Hello to you, O Nāmakaokapāo'o."" Nāmakaokapāo'o took the head of Puali'i and cast it into the sea of Waipouli, he was at the edge of Honouliuli, his loa, five miles the loa.","**Paragraph 9:**  
• The text describes a pivotal moment where Nāmakaokapāo'o completes a ritual or prayer, symbolizing the culmination of a spiritual or cultural act. The phrase ""ko‘ilipi i luna pono o Nāmakaokapāo'o"" (the ""ko‘ilipi"" on the pono of Nāmakaokapāo'o) may allude to a sacred object or concept tied to his identity, possibly a metaphor for his spiritual authority or the ""head"" of his lineage.  
• Puali'i’s attempt to ""obtain the prayer"" and ""reverse the eyes of the ko'i"" (perhaps a symbolic reference to disrupting a sacred vision or power) reflects tensions between traditional practices and transformative actions. The ""head"" (po‘o) and ""eyes"" (‘oi) here may carry dual meanings: literal body parts and metaphors for leadership or insight, aligning with Hawaiian cosmology where the head is sacred (pō‘o) and eyes (‘oi) signify perception or divine knowledge.  
• The dialogue ""Aloha ‘oe"" (Hello to you) is a respectful greeting, emphasizing relational dynamics. The act of Nāmakaokapāo'o taking Puali'i’s head and casting it into the sea of Waipouli (a place name) may symbolize the severing of a spiritual or familial bond, a common motif in Hawaiian narratives where water represents transition or purification.  
• The phrase ""he ana ma kahakai o Honouliuli, ‘o kona loa, ‘elima mile ka loa"" (he was at the edge of Honouliuli, his loa, five miles the loa) likely references specific geographic or ritual locations. ""Loa"" (a name or term for a deity or spirit) and ""five miles"" could signify a symbolic boundary or a metaphor for distance from sacred practices, suggesting a shift away from 'Ai Kapu (sacred) traditions.  
• The narrative mirrors themes from earlier examples, such as the conflict between ""Ai Kapu"" rituals (sacred laws) and progressive change. Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions—destroying sweet potato patches (Example 3) and now casting a head into the sea—reflect a defiance of traditional hierarchies, possibly allegorizing the abandonment of ritualistic violence or the rejection of kapu restrictions.  
• The name ""Puali'i"" (possibly derived from *pua* [flower] + *li‘i* [to twist or bind]) may symbolize a figure tied to earthly or spiritual entanglements, while ""Nāmakaokapāo'o"" (eyes of the pāo'o fish) underscores his connection to water and vision, aligning with the sea imagery.  
• The act of casting the head into the sea could parallel the ""kiola"" (to throw) ritual, where offerings are made to deities or to cleanse a space, reflecting a cultural practice of returning objects to their origin or purifying through water.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

He spoke: 'O chief! A very strong little boy, his father was dead and his head was cut off in the sea, a very high place, fifty miles the height.' About ‘Ama‘u, there was his strength and his death, so, I will kill him because there is no stronger one. He spoke in Waikīkī, the words were about Nāmakaokapāo‘o.""","• This paragraph continues the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo'o's life after Puali'i's death, emphasizing the absence of sustenance (""‘a‘ohe ‘ai o Nāmakaokapāo'o i ka ‘ai"") and the symbolic link between his survival and the collapse of traditional practices like 'Ai Kapu, where food was restricted and rituals governed resource use;  
– The phrase ""ua kiola ‘ia kona po‘o i kai loa"" (""his head was cut off in the sea"") may allude to a ritualistic act of severing a symbolic ""head"" (po‘o) of the land or a person, reflecting the severing of ancestral ties or the destruction of sacred symbols during the transition from 'Ai Kapu to Western practices;  
• The name ‘Ama‘u (a chief of O‘ahu) is tied to Waikīkī, a historically significant area associated with royal and spiritual practices. The mention of a visitor from Honouliuli (a district in 'Ewa, O'ahu) highlights the interconnectedness of Hawaiian communities and the role of chiefs in overseeing resources;  
– ""‘Elima mile ka lō‘ihi"" (""fifty miles the height"") could symbolize a sacred or metaphorical measurement, possibly referencing the ""height"" of a chief's power or the spiritual elevation of a place, with ""mile"" (miles) as a poetic exaggeration for vastness;  
• The dialogue ""I will kill him because there is no stronger one"" reflects the cultural tension between Nāmakaokapāo'o's strength (symbolized by his ""ikaika,"" ""i.e., 'strong' or 'mighty') and the traditional 'Ai Kapu era, where strength was often tied to divine favor and ritual. The act of ""kiola"" (cutting off the head) may allegorically represent the dismantling of old customs, as seen in earlier paragraphs where Nāmakaokapāo'o's destructive actions symbolized the end of 'Ai Kapu;  
– The repetition of ""kai loa"" (sea) and ""lō‘ihi loa"" (height) reinforces the theme of the ocean as a boundary between the sacred and the profane, and the ""height"" as a metaphor for spiritual or social status, aligning with the earlier allegory of Nāmakaokapāo'o's destructive power over the land's resources;  
• The final line about 'Ama‘u's words being ""about Nāmakaokapāo'o"" suggests a continuation of the symbolic conflict, where Nāmakaokapāo'o's strength and defiance of 'Ai Kapu practices are contrasted with the lingering influence of traditional power structures, as represented by 'Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu. This underscores the story's allegorical critique of cultural change and the struggle between old and new paradigms.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",

• The narrative continues to highlight Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s (Eyes of the Head) actions, emphasizing his disruption of domestic and spiritual spaces; • The ""cave of Waipouli"" (Waipouli: ""waipu"" [to flow] + ""oli"" [a place]) may symbolize a liminal or sacred space, reflecting the transition between earthly and divine realms; • The mother’s movement to ""Keahumoa’s house"" (Keahumoa: ""kea"" [chicken] + ""humoa"" [to gather]) underscores the importance of ancestral land and the re-establishment of familial ties; • The symbolic act of ""removing the mat (mau'u) and door (kua) from the entrance (kau'oku) of the house"" may allegorically represent the dismantling of traditional boundaries or rituals, aligning with the story’s broader critique of 'Ai Kapu (sacred eating) practices; – In Hawaiian culture, the entrance (kau'oku) is a threshold of significance, where social and spiritual exchanges occur. The removal of the mat and door could signify a rejection of ancestral customs or a shift in power dynamics within the household; – The phrase ""resided in the middle of the entrance"" (waena i luna pono o ke kaupoku) may metaphorically indicate Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s defiance of conventional roles, positioning himself as a central figure in a space traditionally reserved for elders or spiritual leaders, reflecting his disruptive, god-like nature; • This passage reinforces the theme of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o as a symbol of forward-thinking, challenging the rigid structures of the 'Ai Kapu era, where such acts of defiance would have carried profound cultural and spiritual implications.","Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

Suddenly, they returned, and Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from the top of the fire. They heard the voice, no one had knowledge of the head, and they asked: ""How are you going to do this?""

• **""Aia ma ka po'e ho'okahi he kanahā kumamāwalu kānaka ka nui""** (There was a large person's strength among the individuals) suggests a cultural emphasis on physical prowess and the sacredness of strength, a value tied to the **'Ai Kapu era** (sacred dietary laws), where strength was often linked to ritual and social hierarchy;  
• **""Ke kula o Keahumoa""** (the plains of Keahumoa) is a recurring location in the story, symbolizing a space of conflict or transformation, possibly tied to the **'Ai Kapu** practice of communal living and resource management;  
• **""Kā 'oukou o 'one'i""** (you of the head) may allude to the **""po'o"" (head)** as a metaphor for authority or sacrifice, echoing earlier references to **""po'o""** in Nāmakaokapāo'o’s name (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *po'o*: ""head, chief, first, beginning""; *kaua* (strong) and *kānaka* (person) combine to imply a focus on leadership and power dynamics;  
• The **""kāhea mai 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o i luna o kaupoku""** (Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from the top of the fire) symbolizes a confrontation with the sacred fire of the **'Ai Kapu** system, where fire was both a ritual and a metaphor for divine authority;  
• The dialogue ""He aha mai nei kā 'oukou o 'one'i?"" (""What is this that you are doing?"") reflects the tension between traditional practices and Nāmakaokapāo'o’s radical actions, as seen in earlier paragraphs where he dismantled sacred structures;  
• The mention of **""wahi keiki 'u'uku""** (place for the children of 'u'uku, a type of fish) ties to the **'Ai Kapu** symbolism of substituting fish for human sacrifice, as noted in previous examples (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua* (fish) as a substitute for human offerings); **""u'uku""** here may represent a sacred or communal resource, contrasting with Nāmakaokapāo'o’s earlier destruction of sweet potato patches;

• The phrase **""nāna nō i pepehi i kona makua kāne, 'o Puali'i""** (he alone was the son of his father, Puali'i) highlights the **lineage of Puali'i** (a name associated with divine or ancestral connections), suggesting a continuation of the conflict between Nāmakaokapāo'o and the traditional power structures of the time.","Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men.

– **Ko'olau** (Ko'olau, a mountain on O'ahu): The reference to Ko'olau as a place of significance may allude to its historical role as a site of spiritual or territorial importance, where Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions (e.g., destroying sweet potato patches) challenge traditional practices;  
• The phrase ""pau loa i ka make"" (completely destroyed the sweet potato) mirrors earlier symbolic actions in the text, where sweet potatoes (‘uala) are tied to ritual and sustenance. Here, the destruction of 'uala may allegorically represent the dismantling of 'Ai Kapu practices, as seen in previous examples (e.g., Paragraph 6);  
– **'Ama'u ma Waikīkī** (Ama'u of the sea in Waikīkī): ""Ama'u"" (to search or seek) is linked to the name ""Ama'u,"" a deity associated with the ocean and navigation, suggesting a metaphorical connection to the ""Ai Kapu"" era’s reliance on sacred resources;  
– **'Āha'ilono** (Ā-ha-i-lono, ""the place of searching"" or ""the land of inquiry""): This could symbolize a transition from ritualistic practices to a more secular or progressive mindset, as seen in the story’s broader themes of abandoning 'Ai Kapu;  
• The dialogue ""e make ana 'oe iā mākou, 'a'ole 'oe e ola"" (""you will die, you will not live"") reflects the harsh consequences of violating 'Ai Kapu laws, where certain actions (e.g., destroying sacred crops) were considered taboo and punishable by death;  
– The repetition of ""make"" (kill) and ""ola"" (live) underscores the binary of life and death in the 'Ai Kapu system, where spiritual transgressions had dire outcomes;  
• The instruction ""Ho'i aku ho'okākā i lalo e hakakā ai"" (""Return and rest"") may allude to the need for reconciliation or ritual purification, as ""hakā"" (to rest) could imply a return to balance or harmony in the cultural framework;  
– The act of ""koe aku ho'okahi kanaka"" (""you become one person"") may symbolize the merging of identities or the erasure of individuality under the weight of cultural obligations, a recurring theme in stories about resistance to 'Ai Kapu.","Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him."" The soldiers said, ""No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.""

– **Narrative Context:** This passage introduces Ama'u, a figure associated with strength and warfare, as he travels to Ewa (a region in O'ahu) to confront Nāmakaokapāo'o, a recurring character from earlier chapters. The phrase ""ho'omākaukau ihola"" (famous for his strong canoes) highlights Ama'u’s martial prowess, linking him to the tradition of seafaring and combat in pre-unification Hawaii.  
– **Cultural Practice:** The act of ""e noke mai ana 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o i ka luku ā pau loa"" (to take the full strength of Nāmakaokapāo'o) may allude to the ritual of ""kūpuna"" (ancestral strength) or ""ho'okipa"" (to take as a challenge), where warriors sought to overpower opponents to assert dominance. The phrase ""a'ohe kanaka koe"" (no one is like you) reflects the Hawaiian concept of ""mālama ʻōlelo"" (respect for language) and the emphasis on individual valor, a key theme in the *Ai Kapu* era, where strength and lineage determined social status.  
– **Symbolic Action:** ""Ho'onoho ihola i luna o ka 'āina O'ahu nei"" (to fight on the land of O'ahu) symbolizes the clash between rival chiefs or factions over territorial control. The land of O'ahu, historically a contested region, represents the physical and spiritual battleground for power. The reference to ""kona makuahine"" (his wife) suggests Ama'u’s personal stake in the conflict, tying familial loyalty to warfare.  
– **Allegorical Interpretation:** Ama'u’s journey to Ewa and his confrontation with Nāmakaokapāo'o may allegorically represent the tension between centralized authority and localized power struggles during the pre-unification period. The ""strong canoes"" (wa'a kaua) could symbolize naval dominance, while ""fighting on the land"" (ho'onoho ihola) underscores the transition from seafaring to terrestrial conflict, reflecting the dual nature of Hawaiian warfare. The phrase ""a'ohe kanaka koe"" (no one is like you) may critique the hubris of warriors who overestimate their strength, a common theme in Hawaiian narratives about the consequences of defying kapu (sacred laws).  
– **Name Etymology:**  
– *Ama'u* (Ama'u): Possibly derived from *ama* (to fight, to struggle) or *amaʻu* (to be strong, to endure), emphasizing his role as a warrior.  
– *Nāmakaokapāo'o* (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o): ""Nā maka"" (eyes) and ""ka pāo'o"" (a type of fish, also a poetic term for ""head""). The name may symbolize Nāmakaokapāo'o’s connection to the ocean and his earlier destruction of sweet potato patches (as in Example 3), linking him to the ""Ai Kapu"" tradition of resource control and ritual sacrifice.  
– **Historical Context:** Ewa and O'ahu were regions where conflicts over land and resources were frequent. The mention of ""kona po'e kānaka ma 'Ewa"" (the people of Ewa) highlights the communal aspect of warfare, where leaders mobilized their communities for battle, a practice rooted in the *mo'okūauhau* (genealogical) and *moolelo* (history) traditions of Hawaiian society.","When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
