There are two such islands here from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau, in the sea and the warrior. Kauluakaha‘i is her father, and Kahikipapaialewa is a land in Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī is her mother. She is a great chief for Kahikipapaialewa, and a divine teacher or priest.","• [Allegorical interpretation of the fish child as a symbol of cultural resilience and transformation]  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o) translates to ""the eye of the pāo‘o,"" where ""maka"" (eye) and ""pāo‘o"" (a type of fish or metaphor for ""to stretch"") may symbolize the ability to ""see"" or navigate the vastness of the ocean, a central theme in Polynesian navigation and identity.  
  – The ""sea and the warrior"" (‘u‘uku a me ke koa loa) reflects the dual forces of nature (ocean) and human strength (warrior), suggesting the interplay between environmental and societal power.  

• [Symbolism of names and their ties to Hawaiian cosmology and social hierarchy]  
  – Kauluakaha‘i (Kau-lu-a-kaha‘i): ""Kau"" (to stretch/extend), ""luā"" (two), and ""kaha‘i"" (a name or ""to rise"") may allegorically represent the expansion of knowledge or power through duality, mirroring the ""two pillars"" of Hawaiian society (ali‘i and kūpuna).  
  – Kahikipapaialewa (Kahi-papa-ai-lewa): ""Kahi"" (a place), ""papa"" (board/foundation), ""ai"" (to eat), and ""lewa"" (a name or ""to be still"") could symbolize a ""foundation for sustenance"" or a place of spiritual nourishment, reflecting the importance of land and resources in traditional Hawaiian governance.  
  – Pōka‘ī (Pō-ka-‘ī): ""Pō"" (night), ""ka"" (the), and ""‘ī"" (a name or ""to be silent"") may evoke the ""night of creation"" or hidden knowledge, aligning with the concept of ""mo‘olelo pō"" (night stories) as repositories of ancestral wisdom.  

• [Historical context: Transition from ‘Ai Kapu to post-contact society]  
  – The mention of ""Kahikipapaialewa"" as a land in ""Kahikinu‘u"" (possibly a reference to the sacred ""kino"" or ""kūpuna"" lineage) may allude to the 1819 abolition of the ‘Ai Kapu (sacred dietary laws), which dismantled the old kapu system and disrupted traditional land divisions.  
  – The phrase ""he ali‘i nui kona makua kāne"" (a great chief is her father) highlights the role of ali‘i (noble class) in pre-contact Hawaii, but the presence of a ""divine teacher"" (‘ao‘ao akua) post-1820 suggests the influence of Christian missionaries, who introduced new spiritual frameworks.  

• [Numerical symbolism and social commentary]  
  – ""Luā"" (two) in Kauluakaha‘i and ""pāo‘o"" (fish) may reference the ""two worlds"" of traditional and colonial Hawaii, symbolizing the clash and synthesis of cultures.  
  – The structure ""a he keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio"" (a mighty child in her youth) critiques the erosion of generational knowledge, as post-contact periods saw the decline of oral traditions and the imposition of written systems.  

• [Cultural practices and allegorical critique]  
  – The ""ko koa loa"" (warrior of long) may allude to the ""kū‘au"" (warrior) class, whose power was diminished after the 1819 abolition, reflecting the collapse of the old social order.  
  – The term ""‘ao‘ao akua"" (divine teacher) could symbolize the shift from traditional spiritual leaders (kāhuna) to Christian missionaries, who redefined Hawaiian spirituality and education.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This chapter from Hawaiian oral tradition centers on the figure of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a mighty fish child and revered chief, whose story intertwines themes of strength, lineage, spiritual authority, and the sacred relationship between humans and the natural world. The narrative begins with her introduction as a powerful individual, daughter of Pōka‘ī and Kauluakaha‘i, and a divine teacher, emphasizing her dual role as both a human and a spiritual entity. Her connection to the land and sea is highlighted through references to taro fields, fishing rituals, and sacred places like Honouliuli and Waipouli, reflecting the cultural importance of agriculture and resource stewardship in Hawaiian society. 

The chapter also explores themes of familial and marital bonds, as seen in the interactions between Pōka‘ī, Puali‘i, and Ama‘u, illustrating the blending of lineages and the responsibilities of leadership. Rituals and prayers play a significant role, with Puali‘i’s ko‘ilipi (a sacred chant or teaching) symbolizing the transmission of knowledge and the invocation of divine protection. The prayer to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, which includes references to deities and guardians of sacred spaces, underscores the spiritual dimensions of Hawaiian cosmology and the reverence for ancestral figures. 

Historically, the text reflects the structure of traditional Hawaiian society, where chiefs (ali‘i) held both political and spiritual power, and where the land (‘āina) and its resources were deeply tied to cultural identity. The mention of specific locations like O‘ahu, Hawai‘i, and Ni‘ihau situates the story within the archipelago’s geography, while the references to salt fields, taro, and the sea highlight the ecological and agricultural practices of the time. The narrative also touches on themes of mortality and legacy, as seen in the deaths of Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and the subsequent transfer of power and offerings to Puali‘i, suggesting a focus on afterlife rituals and the continuity of sacred duties. 

Culturally, the chapter exemplifies the integration of myth and history, where human figures are imbued with divine attributes, and natural elements are personified as part of a spiritual framework. The significance in Hawaiian literature lies in its preservation of ancestral stories, values of resilience and reciprocity with the environment, and the role of chiefs as mediators between the physical and spiritual realms. The synthesis of these elements creates a cohesive narrative that emphasizes the interconnectedness of life, the sanctity of resources, and the enduring legacy of powerful figures in shaping Hawaiian cultural and spiritual heritage. The text also serves as a reminder of the consequences of conflict and the importance of maintaining balance through rituals and offerings, as seen in the tragic fates of the characters and the symbolic acts of covering salt fields and fires. Overall, the chapter is a rich tapestry of Hawaiian worldview, blending myth, history, and ecological wisdom into a narrative of profound cultural resonance."

  – [The text reflects the birth of Pōka‘ī and his child Nāmakapāo‘o, emphasizing sacred lineage and the interplay between human and divine realms, common in Hawaiian moolelo (myths) to explain ancestry and kapu (sacred laws)]  
  – [The phrase ""ma laila lāua i launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" suggests a ritualistic journey or quest, aligning with traditional Hawaiian practices of seeking divine favor or guidance through acts of sacrifice and rest (moe ‘ana iho, ""sleeping in the night"") before encountering a spiritual figure.]  

• [Analysis of character names and symbolic meanings]  
  – [Hō‘ae‘ae: ""Hō"" (to be, to exist) + ""ae‘ae"" (eternal, endless), symbolizing a timeless or eternal presence in the land of Ewa]  
  – [Nāmakapāo‘o: ""Nā"" (the) + ""makama"" (to be born) + ""pāo‘o"" (a term possibly linked to ""pā‘ō"" (to be high or elevated), suggesting a lineage of spiritual or royal birth]  
  – [Pōka‘ī: ""Pō"" (night, underworld) + ""ka‘ī"" (to be, to exist), representing a figure born of darkness or the spiritual realm, possibly tied to ancestral deities]  
  – [Kauluakaha‘i: ""Kau"" (to be high, to elevate) + ""lu"" (to be) + ""ka"" (the) + ""haha‘i"" (to be born), symbolizing elevation through birth or spiritual ascension.]  

• [Historical and cultural context: Transition from 'Ai Kapu to post-contact narratives]  
  – [The mention of ""hāpai"" (to be born) and ""hānau"" (born) aligns with pre-contact Hawaiian practices of documenting genealogies and sacred births, which were central to maintaining kapu (sacred laws) and social order.]  
  – [The name ""Nāmakapāo‘o"" may allude to the 'Ai Kapu era, where certain births or lineages were protected by kapu, but the text’s structure hints at a post-1820 shift, as missionary influence began to reshape oral traditions into written records, blending indigenous and Christian symbolism.]  
  – [The term ""‘ilihune"" (spiritual phenomenon) could symbolize the lingering power of traditional beliefs, even as colonialism introduced new ideologies, reflecting tensions between old and new worldviews.]  

• [Numerical symbolism and allegorical critique of social structures]  
  – [The repetition of ""hānau"" (born) and the structure of the sentence may allude to the three realms of Hawaiian cosmology (mo‘o, moana, and mo’ohina), suggesting a birth that bridges these worlds.]  
  – [The act of ""launa kino ai"" (killing in the act) might allegorically represent the destruction of old kapu systems, as 1819’s abolition of the 'Ai Kapu under Kamehameha II’s reign disrupted traditional social hierarchies.]  
  – [The narrative’s focus on lineage and spiritual legacy critiques the erosion of indigenous knowledge systems, as missionary schools and Western education began to marginalize traditional moolelo in the post-1820 period.]","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and asked him, spoke to him: “Ask you about a wife now.” Pōka‘ī replied: “How do you ask me about a wife? I have children, and my husband is dead.” Puali‘i replied: “These things are nothing, you ask me, let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed. Then Pōka‘ī with his husband and Puali‘i to the house of Keahumoa, reside.","• The dialogue between Puali‘i and Pōka‘i allegorically represents the tension between traditional Hawaiian values and the transformative pressures of colonialism and missionary influence.  
  – Pōka‘i’s assertion of having children and a deceased husband reflects the disruption of the *‘Ai Kapu* (sacred dietary laws) and social structures during the 1819 abolition of the kapu system, which dismantled rigid gender roles and familial hierarchies.  
  – Puali‘i’s dismissal of Pōka‘i’s status as “nothing” symbolizes the erosion of old traditions, while his suggestion of “sleeping together” (e moe kāua) metaphorically signifies the imposition of new, foreign norms, such as monogamy and Christian marriage practices.  

• Symbolism of names and terms:  
  – *Puali‘i* (Pua-li‘i): “Pua” (flower) and “li‘i” (to be small, humble). The name may symbolize a person who is modest yet vital, reflecting the fragility of traditional Hawaiian identity under external pressures.  
  – *Pōka‘ī* (Pō-ka‘ī): “Pō” (night) and “ka‘ī” (to be strong, firm). Suggests resilience or steadfastness, possibly representing the last vestiges of pre-contact social order.  
  – *Keahumoa* (Kea-humoa): “Kea” (a type of bird, often associated with royalty) and “humoa” (to be strong, firm). The term may symbolize a new, fortified social structure emerging post-1820, influenced by missionary reforms.  

• Historical and cultural context:  
  – The *‘Ai Kapu* era (pre-1819) emphasized strict social codes, including restrictions on marriage and food. Pōka‘i’s reference to his husband’s death and children may allude to the collapse of these systems, as kapu were abolished by Kamehameha II in 1819, allowing for the mixing of men and women and the reorganization of family life.  
  – Post-1820 missionary influence introduced Christian morality, which likely shaped the narrative’s critique of polygamy and the redefinition of relationships. The phrase “e moe kāua” (let’s sleep together) could reflect the missionaries’ emphasis on “chastity” and “family” as replacements for traditional *kānaka‘o* (sacred unions) or *kumu‘o* (marriage alliances).  
  – The term *kāne* (husband) and *wahine* (wife) in the dialogue may highlight the shift from *kānaka‘o* (sacred partnerships) to more rigid, Western-influenced marital roles, as documented in studies of Hawaiian social transformation (e.g., Kuykendall, 1953).  

• Numerical symbolism and riddles:  
  – The absence of explicit numbers in the text may symbolize the void left by the collapse of the kapu system, where traditional structures were replaced by ambiguity.  
  – The repetition of “kāne” (husband) and “wahine” (wife) could reflect the binary oppositions in Hawaiian cosmology, such as *maunakea* (mountain) and *moana* (ocean), but here it underscores the destabilization of gender roles.  

• Social commentary:  
  – The narrative critiques the loss of autonomy in Hawaiian social systems, as Pōka‘i’s agency is undermined by Puali‘i’s proposition, mirroring the erosion of *mo‘olelo* (history/tradition) under colonialism.  
  – Puali‘i’s dismissal of Pōka‘i’s past (“he mea ‘ole ia mau mea”) may reflect the missionaries’ view of traditional practices as “heathen” or “useless,” as seen in early 19th-century missionary journals (e.g., Bingham, 1823).  
  – The union of Pōka‘i with Puali‘i and his husband in the “house of Keahumoa” could symbolize the forced integration of Hawaiian society into a new, foreign framework, where *ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi* (Hawaiian language) and *kuleana* (rights) were marginalized.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

Therefore, Puali‘i went to the sea of Honouliuli to fish for food with the taro.""","• [Allegorical interpretation of the passage]  
  – The text reflects a transition from traditional Hawaiian agricultural practices to maritime activities, symbolizing the shift from sustenance-based to trade-oriented livelihoods during the post-contact era. The ""two rows of taro fields"" (māla ‘uala) may represent the sacred connection between land, food, and identity, while the act of leaving them behind (e waiho nei) suggests disruption or loss due to external forces.  
  – The name ""Puali‘i"" (pau + li‘i) could allegorically signify ""the one who completes the task"" or ""the one who is left behind,"" hinting at a figure navigating between tradition and change. The ""sea of Honouliuli"" (kai o Honouliuli) might symbolize the Pacific as a space of exploration and transformation, contrasting with the grounded, ancestral ties of taro.  

• [Analysis of character names and symbolism]  
  – **Puali‘i**: ""Pau"" (to finish, complete) + ""li‘i"" (to leave, to be left behind). This name may symbolize a leader or figure who embodies the tension between concluding old practices and being displaced by new ones.  
  – **Namakaokapāo‘o**: ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (the sea of the chief’s pāo‘o, a term for a sacred staff or symbol of authority). The name ties the land to the ocean, suggesting a sacred relationship between the fields and the sea, as taro (‘uala) is both a staple crop and a symbol of human origin in Hawaiian cosmology.  
  – **Pōka‘ī**: ""Pō"" (night) + ""ka‘ī"" (to be left behind). This name may represent the unseen or the hidden, reflecting the idea of sustenance derived from the ocean’s depths, which were often considered sacred and mysterious.  

• [Historical and cultural context]  
  – The reference to ""two rows of taro fields"" (māla ‘uala) connects to the *‘Ai Kapu* era (pre-1819), where taro was a sacred plant tied to the *kānaka* (people) as descendants of Hāloa (taro), emphasizing agricultural interdependence with spiritual life (Kamakani, 1992).  
  – The abandonment of *‘Ai Kapu* in 1819, following Kamehameha I’s death, marks a cultural rupture, mirrored here by the act of leaving the fields behind. The narrative may critique this shift, framing it as a loss of ancestral knowledge.  
  – The mention of fishing (""e lawai‘a i i‘a"") and the ocean (""kai"") reflects the post-1820 missionary influence, where Western practices introduced new methods of resource exploitation, contrasting with traditional *lo‘i* (taro fields) as sites of communal stewardship.  

• [Symbolism of duality and transformation]  
  – The ""two rows"" (māla ‘uala) may symbolize the *mo‘o* (duality) in Hawaiian cosmology, representing balance between land and sea, or the physical and spiritual realms.  
  – Puali‘i’s journey to the sea could allegorically depict the *mālama ʻāina* (caring for the land) ethos, where survival depends on adapting to environmental and cultural changes, yet risks losing ancestral ties.  

• [Social commentary and critique]  
  – The passage critiques the erosion of traditional food systems, as taro fields (symbolizing *kuleana* [responsibility] and *ʻāina* [land]) are replaced by fishing, reflecting the impact of colonialism on Hawaiian subsistence practices.  
  – The name ""Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" (sea of the chief’s staff) may allude to the loss of *māla* as sacred spaces, replaced by commodification of resources under foreign influence.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

The meat of Nāmakaokapāo‘o at that time was large, twice as much as its smallness, not to be caught, it would be left. They went to the taro fields, as the children were told, ""Catch the pu‘e (a type of plant or fish) with the entire lau ‘uala (taro leaves) on top, leave any to grow."" Therefore, the children were only, because they were only in the taro, no one caught the pu‘e.","• [Allegorical interpretation of resource management and spiritual boundaries]  
  – The passage reflects the tension between human exploitation and natural sustainability, mirroring the collapse of the 'Ai Kapu (taboo) system after 1819, when traditional resource restrictions were abolished.  
  – The ""fish"" (lawai‘a) and ""taro fields"" (māla ‘uala) symbolize the sacred relationship between humans and the environment, where overharvesting leads to imbalance.  

• [Analysis of names and symbolism]  
  – **Puali‘i**: ""Pau"" (complete) + ""li"" (to be), suggesting ""The one who is complete"" or ""The one of wholeness,"" representing a guardian of balance.  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: ""Nāmaka"" (sea, calm) + ""o"" (possessive) + ""ka-pāo‘o"" (the one who is in the sea), translating to ""The one who dwells in the calm sea,"" symbolizing a deity or ancestral figure tied to the ocean.  
  – **‘Umi** (fish): A term often associated with the god of fish, highlighting the sacredness of marine resources in Hawaiian cosmology.  
  – **Pu‘e** (plant/fish): Possibly derived from ""pu‘e"" (to be still or quiet), allegorizing the need for restraint in harvesting.  

• [Historical and cultural context]  
  – The narrative aligns with pre-contact practices of *‘Ai Kapu*, where specific resources were protected through spiritual and social taboos. The ""taro fields"" (māla ‘uala) emphasize the central role of taro (*Colocasia esculenta*) in Hawaiian agriculture and cosmology, as taro is considered a sacred ancestor.  
  – The phrase ""twice as much as its smallness"" (‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e) may allude to the *kū‘au* (sacred grove) concept, where overharvesting (mistaking smallness for abundance) leads to ecological or spiritual consequences.  
  – The instruction to ""leave any to grow"" (mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana) echoes the *kuleana* (responsibility) of *kānaka‘āina* (Hawaiian people) to steward the land, a principle reinforced by the *mālama ‘āina* (caring for the land) ethos.  

• [Numerical symbolism and riddles]  
  – The number **two** (*‘elua*) in ""‘elua kapua‘i"" (twice as much) may symbolize duality in Hawaiian cosmology, such as the balance between *mo‘okū‘au* (sacred) and *mālama* (care), or the tension between human needs and ecological limits.  
  – The repetition of ""kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala"" (only in the taro) could signify the *kuleana* of the younger generation to uphold ancestral practices, a theme central to post-1820 missionary-influenced narratives that emphasized moral discipline.  

• [Social commentary and post-contact biases]  
  – The story critiques unchecked resource extraction, a theme that resonates with the *Ai Kapu* era’s collapse, which allowed for overfishing and deforestation. The ""children"" (keiki) may represent the next generation, whose adherence to traditional rules (or lack thereof) determines the survival of ecosystems.  
  – The phrase ""no one caught the pu‘e"" might reflect a cautionary tale against violating spiritual boundaries, a narrative that missionaries later reinterpreted as ""superstition,"" highlighting colonial biases in preserving indigenous knowledge.  
  – The allegory of the ""large meat"" (kino ‘u‘uku loa) versus ""mistake of smallness"" (hapa kona ki‘eki‘e) underscores the danger of misjudging natural abundance, a lesson tied to the *kū‘au* (sacred grove) and *kuleana* (responsibility) in Hawaiian society.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then, again, Nāmakaokapāo‘o covered the fire, a more intense fire, eight pieces of salt on top of a place where it is placed. For that, the fire is covered on top of the fire, then the man's head is placed below, and the woman's head is placed. To Pōka‘ī: ""No."" Puali‘i says: ""Yes, the great one is the one who and the eyes of the thing that is eaten in this day, then, in that day, he is made.""","• [Allegorical interpretation of the passage]  
  – The text uses salt and fire as symbolic elements to represent the tension between sacred preservation and transformation. Salt fields (""māla ‘uala"") may allegorically signify the sacred resources of the land, while the act of covering (""huhuki"") reflects rituals of concealment or protection, possibly tied to the 'Ai Kapu (sacred food laws) of pre-contact Hawaii.  
  – The ""fire"" (""ahi"") and ""eight pieces of salt"" (""‘ehā ‘au o ka ‘uala"") could symbolize the balance between spiritual and material forces, with eight representing the cyclical nature of time or the eight directions in Hawaiian cosmology.  

• [Analysis of character names and symbolism]  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: ""Nā"" (the), ""Maka"" (eyes), ""o"" (of), ""ka pāo‘o"" (parrotfish). The name translates to ""The Eyes of the Parrotfish,"" symbolizing vigilance or guardianship over sacred resources. Parrotfish (""pāo‘o"") are culturally significant as symbols of the ocean’s vitality and are linked to the god Kanaloa, associated with the deep sea.  
  – **Pōka‘ī** and **Puali‘i**: ""Pō"" (night/darkness), ""kā‘ī"" (to cover/hide), ""pau"" (end). These names may reflect duality—Pōka‘ī (""Night Hider"") and Puali‘i (""End of the Hiding"")—symbolizing the conflict between secrecy (traditional practices) and revelation (post-contact changes).  

• [Historical and cultural context]  
  – **'Ai Kapu era (pre-1819)**: The act of covering salt fields may allude to the sacredness of salt in Hawaiian society, used in rituals and as a preservative. The 'Ai Kapu system, which governed food taboos, would have required such symbolic acts to maintain spiritual order.  
  – **Post-1820 missionary influence**: The mention of ""eight pieces of salt"" could subtly critique the disruption of traditional practices, as missionaries later introduced new systems of resource management, altering sacred rituals.  
  – **Numerical symbolism**: The number ""eight"" (‘ehā) may reference the *kāne-mālikai* (eight directions) or the *mo‘olelo* (mythological cycles), emphasizing the interconnectedness of spiritual and temporal realms.  

• [Social commentary and critique]  
  – The dialogue between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i (""No"" vs. ""Yes"") reflects the tension between preserving ancestral knowledge and adopting new ideologies post-contact. Pōka‘ī’s ""No"" could symbolize resistance to change, while Puali‘i’s ""Yes"" represents adaptation.  
  – The placement of ""man’s head"" and ""woman’s head"" beneath the fire may allegorically depict the subjugation of traditional gender roles under colonial or missionary influence, where indigenous practices were marginalized.  
  – The phrase ""eia kona lā e make ai ia‘u"" (""in that day, he is made"") hints at the erasure of indigenous systems, as the 'Ai Kapu were abolished in 1819, leading to the collapse of sacred food laws and the rise of Western practices.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children knew, and they stood at a resting place for the eyes of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Behold! This ko‘ilipi in my hand, it is a thing of the night for the time of this day, and the night of the moon, and then, the canoe with the fish, and the food for me first, and then, peace.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not understand these words of Puali‘i, and then, the words of Puali‘i were new, it was the two. Puali‘i was careful to interpret to Nāmakaokapāo‘o the ko‘ilipi, in that time to pray for Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prayer of peace for Puali‘i. Thus the prayer: “Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o, O you who are the guardian of my sacred place, O you who are the guardian of the sea, O you who are the guardian of the moon, O you who are the guardian of the heavens, O Kukui‘aimakaokalani, O my sacred place here, O Nāmakaokai‘a the great chief of Hawai‘i, O you who are silent, O you who are still, O the people, O the sacred, O the sacred, peace only to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”","• The passage reflects a ritualistic exchange between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, symbolizing the transmission of sacred knowledge and the negotiation of power in a pre-contact Hawaiian society  
  – The term *ko‘ilipi* (possibly a sacred object or chant) represents the concealment of knowledge, a common motif in Hawaiian narratives where wisdom is guarded or encoded  
  – The ""eight seas"" (*e ‘au ‘uala āna ‘ehā*) may allegorically reference the eight regions of Hawai‘i or the four cardinal directions multiplied by two (symbolizing balance), aligning with traditional cosmology where the ocean embodies both life and the unknown  
  – The phrase *pule make* (prayer of peace) underscores the spiritual and political significance of *kīke‘i* (sacredness) in Hawaiian governance  

• Analysis of names and symbolism  
  – *Puali‘i*: From *pau* (complete) and *li‘i* (to measure or judge), suggesting a figure of authority or a leader who ""measures"" or ""judges"" the people  
  – *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*: *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (Sea of the pāo‘o), where *pāo‘o* (a type of fish or a term for ""to be silent"") may symbolize the ocean’s role as a boundary between worlds or a source of sustenance  
  – *Kukui‘aimakaokalani*: *Kukui* (light, deity of fire), *aimaka* (sacred), *okalani* (heavens), suggesting a divine protector of sacred knowledge or a celestial guide  
  – *Kālua me ka ‘uala* (canoe with fish) symbolizes survival and resourcefulness, a metaphor for the *mo‘olelo* (stories) that sustain cultural memory  

• Historical and cultural context  
  – The reference to *Ai Kapu era* (the kapu system) is implicit in the sacredness of *ko‘ilipi* and *pule make*, reflecting the pre-contact religious hierarchy where knowledge was guarded by *kūpuna* (elders) and *kahu‘aina* (land stewards)  
  – The phrase *i luna o ke ahi* (on the fire) may allude to the 1819 abolition of the kapu system, where fire symbolized the destruction of old rituals and the rise of new social orders  
  – The prayer’s structure mirrors *mele* (hymns) used in *ho‘okupu* (rituals) to invoke deities, blending pre-contact spirituality with later Christian influences (post-1820 missionary era) in the preservation of oral traditions  

• Numerical symbolism and riddles  
  – *E ‘au ‘uala āna ‘ehā* (eight seas) may encode the eight *māku‘u* (regions) of Hawai‘i, emphasizing the interconnectedness of land and ocean in Hawaiian cosmology  
  – *Lua* (two) in *‘ōlelo hou ‘o Puali‘i, ‘o ka lua ia* (the words of Puali‘i were new, it was the two) could signify the duality of *mo‘okū‘auhau* (genealogical lineage) or the balance between *moana* (ocean) and *āina* (land) in Hawaiian philosophy  

• Social commentary  
  – The tension between Puali‘i’s ""new"" words (*‘ōlelo hou*) and Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s lack of understanding critiques the erosion of traditional knowledge during colonialism, where *kūpuna* were marginalized by foreign influences  
  – The invocation of *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* (divine light of the sacred heavens) may allegorically represent the clash between indigenous spirituality and missionary-driven Christianity, with *kū* (to stand) symbolizing resistance to cultural assimilation  
  – The phrase *e he‘e ka hōhē wale* (to be silent as the hōhē) echoes the *ho‘oponopono‘ī* (restoring balance) process, suggesting a call for harmony amid conflict.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

He is the father of Nāmakaokalani and the child of Nāmakaokai‘a, therefore, they are in the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","• The passage reflects the interplay between ancestral lineage and spiritual authority in Hawaiian cosmology  
  – The phrase ""komo i loko o ka pule"" (to rest in the prayer) suggests a metaphysical connection between the named figures and the divine, aligning with traditional Hawaiian concepts of *mo‘olelo* (myths) as sacred narratives that bridge human and spiritual realms  
  – The repetition of ""Nāmaka"" (eyes) in the names may symbolize the ""eyes of the ocean"" as a metaphor for guardianship over natural resources, a role central to *kupuna* (elders) and *mo‘okūauhau* (genealogical lineage)  

• Analysis of character names and symbolism  
  – *Nāmakaokalani* (Nā-maka-o-ka-lani): ""Eyes of the Sky"" (lani = sky, heavens; makama = eyes). Represents celestial guidance and the role of ali‘i (chiefs) as intermediaries between gods and people  
  – *Nāmakaokai‘a* (Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a): ""Eyes of the Fish"" (i‘a = fish). Symbolizes the ocean’s bounty and the ali‘i’s responsibility to manage *lo‘i‘i* (fishponds) and *kula* (trade) networks  
  – *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o): ""Eyes of the Pāo‘o"" (pāo‘o = a type of fish or a term for ""to be still""). May allude to the *pāo‘o* (a sacred fish in Hawaiian mythology) or the concept of *pō* (night, darkness), hinting at a transition from traditional *mo‘okūauhau* (genealogical knowledge) to post-contact Christian symbolism  

• Historical and cultural context  
  – The reference to ""ali‘i nui lāua"" (great chiefs of Hawai‘i) aligns with the *Ai Kapu* era (pre-contact), where ali‘i were considered divine and their names carried sacred weight  
  – The structure ""makua kāne (father) a keiki (child)"" of the two names may allegorically represent the collapse of the kapu system (1819) and the rise of new social hierarchies under missionary influence (post-1820)  
  – The term ""pule"" (prayer) could indicate a shift toward Christian liturgy, as missionaries replaced traditional *kīmoemoe* (rituals) with biblical practices, though the name *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* retains pre-contact elements of *maka* (eyes) as a metaphor for spiritual vision  

• Numerical symbolism and riddles  
  – ""Kēlā mau inoa ‘elua"" (those two names) emphasizes the number two, a sacred number in Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., *two great gods*: Wakea and Ho‘ohokukoa). The duality may symbolize the merging of *maui* (earth) and *lani* (sky) in the creation narrative  
  – The recursive structure of the names (e.g., *Nāmakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokai‘a*) mirrors the *kumu* (source) and *‘ōlelo* (language) in Hawaiian thought, where repetition reinforces spiritual power  

• Post-contact influences and biases  
  – The phrase ""ua komo i loko o ka pule"" (they are in the prayer) may reflect missionary-era reinterpretations of traditional *kīmoemoe* (rituals) as ""prayers,"" erasing pre-contact *kāne* (male) and *wahine* (female) roles in favor of a singular divine authority  
  – The names ""Nāmakaokalani"" and ""Nāmakaokai‘a"" could have been altered to align with Christian symbolism, though their roots in *maka* (eyes) and *lani* (sky) preserve older cosmological themes","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i.

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The chief of Puali‘i came forth to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Aloha ‘oe, O Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” Then Nāmakaokapāo‘o was carried to the chief of Puali‘i and to the sea of Waipouli, he is in the land of Honouliuli, his loa, five miles of the loa.","• [Allegorical interpretation of the passage as a metaphor for the collapse of the kapu system and the transition to new spiritual paradigms]  
  – The phrase ""A pau ka pule"" (the prayer is ended) symbolizes the conclusion of the traditional Hawaiian religious order, particularly the 'Ai Kapu era (the kapu system), which governed societal rituals and hierarchies. The ""ko‘ilipi i luna pono"" (sacred place of pono) reflects the central role of *pono* (justice, balance, and divine order) in Hawaiian cosmology, suggesting a shift from ritualistic to more secular or hybrid spiritual practices.  
  – The act of ""ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i"" (transferring offerings of the ko‘i) may allegorically represent the dismantling of sacred institutions, as the 1819 abolition of the kapu system by Kamehameha II led to the destruction of *ko‘i* (idols) and the abandonment of rituals.

  – *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* breaks down as *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (the sea of the pāo‘o fish), where *pāo‘o* (a type of fish) symbolizes protection and guidance, often linked to the deity *Kāne* or *Kāne‘o*. The name may represent a spiritual leader or a figure associated with the ocean’s sacredness.  
  – *Puali‘i* derives from *pau* (to finish, complete) and *li‘i* (suffix denoting a place or state), suggesting ""the one who is complete"" or ""the place of finality."" This could symbolize a transition point or a boundary between old and new eras, aligning with the 1819 abolition of the kapu.  

• [Historical context: Post-1820 missionary influence and cultural reconfiguration]  
  – The narrative’s structure and terminology reflect a pre-contact or early contact period, but the mention of ""kiola akula"" (to the sea) and ""Honouliuli"" (a historical site in O‘ahu) may indicate later Christianized or hybridized interpretations. Missionaries often rebranded *ko‘i* (idols) as ""idols"" and *pono* (justice) as ""righteousness,"" altering traditional meanings.  
  – The numerical reference ""‘elima mile ka loa"" (five miles of the loa) could allude to the *kū‘au* (five elements: earth, water, fire, air, spirit) or the *kū‘ike* (five senses), symbolizing a spiritual journey or the integration of traditional and foreign concepts.  
  – The dialogue ""Aloha ‘oe"" (Hello you) contrasts with the rigid formalities of the *kapu* system, hinting at a loosening of social constraints post-1820, as missionaries introduced new values of equality and individualism.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

At that time, Ama‘u was an ali‘i of O‘ahu, in Waikīkī, where she lived, some people went from Honouliuli to Waikīkī to live with the ali‘i. She spoke: “O the ali‘i! A very strong son of a chief, was killed, and his head was severed in the ocean, a very deep place, five miles the depth.” Alohe of Ama‘u, there was strength and death in her, therefore, in her, there was death without strength.

The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",
