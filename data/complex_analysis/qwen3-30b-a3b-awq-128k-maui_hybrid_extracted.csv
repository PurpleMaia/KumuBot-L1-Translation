This text exemplifies the integration of language, history, and spirituality in Hawaiian traditions, where names and places carry layered meanings tied to ancestry, land, and cultural identity. The labels (**b1**, **c**) may indicate a structured system for preserving and transmitting knowledge, a hallmark of Hawaiian oral and written traditions.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This chapter from Hawaiian literature weaves together themes of ancestry, spiritual authority, and the sacred relationship between humans and nature, rooted in traditional cultural practices and cosmology. The narrative centers on **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**, a long-lived child born to **Pōka‘ī** and **Kauluakaha‘i**, with a lineage tied to both royal and priestly heritage. His story is interlaced with **Puali‘i**, a figure associated with taro cultivation and fishing rituals, and **‘Ama‘u**, a chief of O‘ahu, highlighting the interconnectedness of familial, spiritual, and territorial domains. 

The chapter emphasizes **agricultural significance**, particularly the sacredness of taro (*kalo*), which is not only a staple crop but also a symbol of kinship with the gods. Puali‘i’s actions—fishing with nets, cultivating taro, and offering prayers—reflect the deep spiritual practices of the time, where natural resources were governed by divine and ancestral laws. The mention of taro fields named after Nāmakaokapāo‘o underscores the cultural and historical legacy tied to land and lineage. 

A recurring motif is the **full moon**, which symbolizes cycles of growth, renewal, and spiritual power. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s connection to the full moon’s ""fire"" and the form of taro leaves suggests a ritualistic or mythological framework where lunar phases dictate agricultural and spiritual activities. The chapter also explores **conflicts between figures**, such as the tension between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and ‘Ama‘u, and the eventual transfer of authority and land to Nāmakaokapāo‘o after Puali‘i’s death, illustrating themes of succession, power dynamics, and the afterlife. 

Culturally, the text reflects the importance of **genealogy** and **ancestral reverence**, as seen in the naming of places and the invocation of deities like **Kukui‘aimakaokalani**. The rituals described, such as the **ko‘ilipi** (a sacred object or chant) and prayers for rest and silence, emphasize the role of spirituality in daily life and governance. The narrative also touches on **mythological concepts of death**, with references to burial at sea, the afterlife, and the idea of ""strength"" as both physical and spiritual, linking to Hawaiian beliefs about the soul’s journey. 

Historically, the chapter serves as a bridge between human and divine realms, illustrating how chiefs and priests mediated between the people and the gods. The synthesis of these elements into a cohesive narrative highlights the significance of this chapter in Hawaiian literature as a foundational text exploring the interplay of lineage, spirituality, and environmental stewardship, while preserving the cultural values of respect for ancestors, sacred land, and the natural world. The story’s structure, with its blend of myth, genealogy, and ritual, exemplifies the oral traditions of Hawaii, where history and spirituality are inseparable."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

In this birth, the one who is born is Pōka‘ī and his child Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","This passage is rooted in Hawaiian mythology and genealogy, reflecting the interconnectedness of land, lineage, and spiritual concepts. Here’s a breakdown of its cultural, historical, and linguistic significance:  

**1. Cultural Context:**  
- **Names and Lineage:** The names *Hō‘ae‘ae*, *Pōka‘ī*, *Kauluakaha‘i*, and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* are likely ancestral or divine figures. *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (possibly ""the sea of the child"") may reference a deity or a symbolic figure tied to the ocean, a central element in Hawaiian cosmology. *Ewa* refers to a region on O‘ahu, emphasizing geographic specificity in creation narratives.  
- **Life and Death Cycle:** The phrase *kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho* (""to be born and to sleep"") alludes to the Hawaiian belief in the cyclical nature of existence, where ""sleep"" metaphorically represents death or the afterlife. This reflects the concept of *ʻōlelo Hawai‘i* as a language of deep spiritual and cosmological meaning.  
- **Marriage as Creation:** The act of *hāpai* (to marry) is not just a social union but a symbolic one, often linked to the creation of life or the establishment of land. The marriage of *Pōka‘ī* and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* may represent a union between divine or ancestral forces, such as land and water, which are foundational in Hawaiian mythology.  

**2. Linguistic Features:**  
- **Prepositions and Locatives:** The use of *ma* (""in"") and *iā* (""to/for"") highlights the importance of spatial and relational markers in Hawaiian syntax. *Iā* here marks the object of the verb *hāpai* (to marry), indicating the recipient of the action.  
- **Verbs and Passive Voice:** *Kino ai* (""to be born"") and *moe ‘ana iho* (""to sleep"") are verbs with spiritual connotations. The passive construction *i launa kino ai* (""to the land to be born"") underscores the land as a passive participant in the narrative, a common feature in Hawaiian storytelling.  
- **Reduplication and Poetic Structure:** Names like *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Kauluakaha‘i* use reduplication (*-ka-*) and suffixes (*-ai*, *-o‘o*) to create rhythmic, poetic forms, which are central to *mele* (Hawaiian chants) and oral traditions.  
- **Anaphora and Repetition:** The repetition of *hānau* (""born"") and *kino ai* (""to be born"") emphasizes the cyclical and recursive nature of creation, a hallmark of Hawaiian cosmogony.  

**3. Historical Significance:**  
- **Ewa as a Sacred Region:** *Ewa* (a district on O‘ahu) is historically significant as a place of cultural and spiritual importance. Its mention here ties the narrative to a specific geographic and ancestral lineage.  
- **Divine Lineage and Ancestral Claims:** The passage may reflect the *kānaka‘āina* (native people) tradition of tracing lineage to divine or ancestral figures. *Pōka‘ī* and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* could be ancestors of the *kānaka‘āina*, linking the people to the land through divine marriage.  
- **Longevity and Legacy:** The phrase *‘ilihune loa* (""very long-lived"") suggests the enduring legacy of these figures, a common motif in Hawaiian narratives where deities or ancestors are often depicted as immortal or with extraordinary lifespans. This reinforces the idea of *ʻāina* (land) as a living entity that sustains and nurtures life.  

**4. Symbolism and Themes:**  
- **Land as a Living Entity:** The text personifies *‘āina* (land) as a place of birth and rest, aligning with the Hawaiian concept of *ʻāina* as both a physical and spiritual entity. The act of *kino ai* (birth) and *moe ‘ana iho* (sleep) reflects the sacred relationship between humans and the land.  
- **Mythological Continuity:** The repetition of names and the structure of the passage suggest a mythological framework where creation is an ongoing process. *Kauluakaha‘i* being born in *kona ‘āina* (""his land"") may symbolize the emergence of new life from ancestral roots.  
- **Ancestral Marriage as a Metaphor:** The marriage of *Pōka‘ī* and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* could symbolize the union of *mauna* (mountains) and *moana* (ocean), key elements in Hawaiian cosmology. This aligns with the belief that the islands were formed through divine unions, such as the creation of the Hawaiian archipelago by the demigod Māui.  

**5. Interpretation of Key Phrases:**  
- *“Ma laila lāua i launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o”*: This could mean ""In that place, the land is where birth and sleep occur, and the one found is Nāmakaokapāo‘o."" The phrase *ā loa‘a* (""is found"") may imply discovery or revelation, suggesting the land’s role in revealing divine or ancestral truths.  
- *“A hāpai ‘o Pōka‘ī iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o”*: ""And Pōka‘ī marries her (Nāmakaokapāo‘o)."" The use of *hāpai* (to marry) in this context may reflect the sacredness of marriage in Hawaiian culture, often tied to the union of *mo‘okūau* (lineage) and *mo‘oleo* (ancestral heritage).  
- *“He ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o”*: ""In this birth, the one who is born is Pōka‘ī and his child Nāmakaokapāo‘o."" The term *‘ilihune loa* (""very long-lived"") may allude to the immortality of deities or the idea of eternal lineage, a concept central to Hawaiian *kīolei* (genealogies).  

This passage exemplifies the complexity of Hawaiian oral traditions, where names, verbs, and spatial terms carry layered meanings. It underscores the cultural value of *ʻāina* (land) as both a physical and spiritual foundation, and the importance of ancestral connections in shaping identity and history.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

The text contains elements of Hawaiian language, culture, and historical context:  

**Cultural Context**:  
1. **Names and Place Names**:  
   - *Pōka‘ī* and *Puali‘i* are likely names of individuals, possibly from Hawaiian mythology or historical figures. *Līhu‘e* (a district on the Big Island of Hawai‘i) and *Honouliuli* (a historic area on O‘ahu) reference specific geographic locations, grounding the story in real-world Hawaiian landscapes. *Keahumoa* may refer to a sacred or ceremonial site, as ""kula"" (field) often symbolizes ritual or agricultural spaces in Hawaiian tradition.  
   - The use of *kāne* (husband) and *kāne me Puali‘i* (his wife and Puali‘i) highlights the importance of familial roles and relationships in Hawaiian society.  

2. **Social Dynamics**:  
   - The dialogue between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i reflects traditional Hawaiian communication norms, where indirectness and respect are emphasized. Pōka‘ī’s refusal to engage in a relationship (""e moe kāua"") may symbolize adherence to cultural protocols, such as avoiding relationships with married individuals or respecting family boundaries.  
   - The phrase ""Ua hānau wau i ke keiki"" (I have children) underscores the value of family and the responsibility of parenthood in Hawaiian culture.  

**Linguistic Features**:  
1. **Syntax and Structure**:  
   - The sentence structure follows the typical Hawaiian SOV (subject-object-verb) order, with particles like *iā* (to/for) and *me* (with) indicating relationships.  
   - *Akula* as a suffix denotes past tense or completed action (e.g., *nānā akula* = ""looked,"" *makemake akula* = ""asked"").  

2. **Vocabulary**:  
   - *Kipa maila* (respectfully) reflects the concept of *aloha* (love, respect) and *kupuna* (elders), emphasizing reverence.  
   - *He mea ‘ole* (it’s not that) uses *mea* (thing) and *‘ole* (not) to express negation, a common structure in Hawaiian.  
   - *E moe kāua* (let us sleep) employs the imperative form *e* + verb, a hallmark of Hawaiian syntax for commands or requests.  

**Historical Significance**:  
1. **Pre-Colonial Values**:  
   - The story may illustrate the importance of *ʻāina* (land) and *kuleana* (responsibility) in Hawaiian society, where individuals were bound to their families and communities. Pōka‘ī’s reference to her husband’s death (*ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino*) could symbolize the sanctity of marriage and the consequences of violating it.  
   - *Honouliuli* was historically a significant area for agricultural and spiritual practices, suggesting the story may involve rituals or land-based traditions.  

2. **Mythological Allusions**:  
   - While the names are not directly tied to major deities, the narrative structure resembles traditional *mo‘oleo* (tales) or *mele* (songs) that convey moral lessons. The phrase ""e moe kāua"" might metaphorically relate to *mo‘oleo* (sleep) as a symbol of rest or inaction, contrasting with the active pursuit of relationships.  
   - The mention of *kāne me Puali‘i* (his wife and Puali‘i) could hint at a polygamous or extended family structure, common in pre-colonial Hawaiian society.  

**Key Themes**:  
- **Respect and Boundaries**: Pōka‘ī’s refusal to engage with Puali‘i highlights the cultural emphasis on respecting others’ relationships and personal space.  
- **Ritual and Sacredness**: The reference to *ke kula o Keahumoa* (the field of Keahumoa) may allude to a sacred space, where certain actions or interactions were restricted.  
- **Language as Identity**: The use of Hawaiian language in the passage preserves indigenous linguistic heritage, reflecting the importance of *ʻōlelo Hawai‘i* in cultural continuity.  

This text exemplifies how Hawaiian narratives encode social norms, spiritual values, and linguistic precision, offering insights into the worldview of pre-colonial Hawaiian society. The dialogue and actions of the characters serve as a microcosm of ethical and relational principles central to Hawaiian life.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Cultural Context:**
1. **Taro (‘uala) as Sacred Staple:** Taro is a central crop in Hawaiian culture, considered a sacred ancestor (as per the *Kumulipo* creation chant). The phrase ""mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla ‘uala lō‘ihi"" emphasizes the enduring cultivation of taro fields, highlighting their spiritual and subsistence importance. The naming of fields after deities or ancestors (e.g., *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*) underscores the belief that land and its resources are tied to divine or familial legacy.

2. **Deities and Ancestral Legacy:** The names *Puali‘i* and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* likely refer to deities or high-ranking ali‘i (chiefly figures). *Puali‘i* is associated with fishing and the ocean, while *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (possibly a variant of *Nāmaka* or *Kapāo‘o*) may relate to water or fertility. The mention of ""the food of his wife, Pōka‘ī"" suggests a connection to domestic or ritual practices, where offerings to deities or ancestors were made.

3. **Ulua Fish and Ritual Significance:** The ""head of the ulua fish"" (*po‘o o ka ulua*) is a sacred offering, as ulua (a type of fish) is linked to the god *Kāne* (creator) and *Kū* (warrior). The phrase ""Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala"" may symbolize the union of marine and agricultural resources, reflecting the balance between ocean and land in traditional Hawaiian subsistence.

**Linguistic Features:**
1. **Syntax and Conjunctions:** The use of *a* (and) as a coordinating conjunction links clauses, while *i* (in) and *ā* (at) indicate location. The structure ""e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā"" employs *e* (to) for purpose, *waiho* (to leave), and *ā hiki i kēia lā* (from here to this day), creating a temporal emphasis on continuity.

2. **Nominalization and Verbs:** The verb *kapa* (to name) is used in the passive construction *ua kapa ‘ia*, reflecting the idea that the fields were named after the figures. The phrase ""‘ōlelo ‘o Puali‘i i kāna ‘ōlelo ho‘ohiki"" uses *‘ōlelo* (speech) as a noun, with *i kāna* (in his) indicating possession, showcasing the Hawaiian focus on ancestral language and identity.

3. **Glottal Stops and Pronouns:** The glottal stop (‘) in names like *Puali‘i* and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* is critical for pronunciation and meaning. The pronoun *ia* (this/that) in *ka inoa o ia mau māla* (the name of those fields) emphasizes specificity, a common feature in Hawaiian discourse.

**Historical Significance:**
1. **Honouliuli Coast:** The reference to *kai o Honouliuli* (coast of Honouliuli) points to a specific geographic area on O‘ahu, historically a site of significant agricultural and fishing activity. The phrase ""descended to the coast"" (*iho akula*) may allude to the migration or settlement of deities or ancestors in this region.

2. **Mythological and Agricultural Practices:** The passage intertwines mythological narratives with practical agricultural and fishing methods. *Puali‘i* is a deity associated with fishing, and the act of ""fishing with nets and cultivating taro"" (*lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala*) reflects the dual focus on marine and land resources in Hawaiian subsistence systems.

3. **Sacred Offerings and Rituals:** The quote about the ulua fish's head and taro likely originates from a ritual or mythological text, where such offerings were made to ensure prosperity. The repetition of *‘ai* (food) and *i‘a* (fish) emphasizes the interconnectedness of marine and agricultural practices in Hawaiian cosmology.

**Key Themes:**
- **Legacy and Naming:** The naming of fields after deities or ancestors (*Nāmakaokapāo‘o*) reflects the Hawaiian concept of *ʻāina* (land) as a living entity tied to lineage and divine will.
- **Sustainability and Continuity:** The phrase ""has remained from here to this day"" (*e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā*) highlights the enduring nature of these practices, suggesting a historical continuity of land use and spiritual reverence.
- **Divine and Human Roles:** The passage blurs the line between divine and human activity, as *Puali‘i*’s actions (fishing, cultivating) are framed as both practical and sacred, aligning with the Hawaiian belief in the divine origin of resources.

This text likely originates from a *mo‘oleo* (genealogy or mythological narrative) or a *mele* (chant) that connects the land, deities, and human activity, illustrating the deep cultural ties between agriculture, spirituality, and identity in Hawaiian society.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

The body of Nāmakaokapāo‘o at that time was a very large body, twice the size of a normal person’s body, and did not have his work, only for the purpose of. They were allowed to fish in the fishponds, as they were with the children, “Fish in the fish with the entire ocean’s net on top, leave one to grow.” Therefore, only the children, then, only the fish in the ocean, no fishing in the fishponds.","**Cultural Context**:  
This passage references traditional Hawaiian fishponds (*māla ‘uala*), which were critical to subsistence and resource management in ancient Hawaii. The names *Puali‘i* and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* may denote ancestral figures or locations, possibly linked to legends or genealogies. The phrase *“e huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala ā pau loa i luna, mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana”* reflects a sustainable fishing practice, where nets (*lau ‘uala*) were used in the ocean (*‘uala*) but not in the fishponds (*māla ‘uala*), emphasizing the importance of preserving fish populations for future generations. The mention of *kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala* (only the fish in the ocean) suggests a division of labor or sacred boundaries between communal and personal resources, a concept rooted in *ʻāina* (land) and *kuleana* (responsibility) in Hawaiian culture.  

**Linguistic Features**:  
- **Prepositions and particles**: The use of *i* (in/at) and *me* (with) highlights spatial and relational connections. For example, *i ka lawai‘a* (in the fish) and *me ka lau ‘uala* (with the net of the ocean).  
- **Imperative constructions**: *E huhuki* (to fish) and *mai waiho* (leave) are imperative verbs, common in commands or proverbs.  
- **Reduplication and metaphor**: *‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e* (twice the size of a normal person’s body) uses *‘elua* (two) and *ki‘eki‘e* (small) to emphasize scale, while *kāohi mālie nō* (only the fish) employs *mālie* (ocean) as a metaphor for abundance.  
- **Proverbial structure**: The quote *“E huhuki i ka pu‘e...”* follows a traditional Hawaiian proverb format, blending practical advice with spiritual or cultural values.  

**Historical Significance**:  
The text alludes to the *māla ‘uala* (fishponds) as a key element of Hawaiian *loco i‘a* (aquaculture), which required careful management to sustain fish populations. The mention of *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (possibly a name of a chief or deity) and *Puali‘i* (a place or person) may tie to oral histories or genealogies, reflecting the interconnectedness of land, water, and people. The restriction on fishing in the fishponds (*‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e*) aligns with historical practices of *kapu* (taboo) or *alaka‘i* (leadership) to protect resources, a system that governed access to *ʻāina* and ensured ecological balance.  

**Additional Notes**:  
- The phrase *“kumamāhiku i nā māla ‘uala”* (fishing in the fishponds) underscores the communal nature of fishponds, which were often managed by *kupuna* (elders) or *mo‘i* (rulers).  
- The reference to *kino ‘u‘uku loa* (a very large body) may symbolize a legendary figure, reflecting the cultural emphasis on physical prowess and divine ancestry.  
- The structure of the passage mirrors traditional Hawaiian storytelling, blending narrative with moral or practical guidance, a hallmark of *mele* (poetry) and *ʻōlelo kūpono* (formal speech).","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

**Cultural Context**:  
This passage reflects the deep connection between Hawaiian cosmology, agriculture, and familial roles. Taro (‘uala) is a sacred plant in Hawaiian culture, symbolizing the origin of humanity (as in the creation story of Hāloa). The full moon (huhuki) is often associated with cycles of growth and spiritual practices. The mention of ""māla ‘uala"" (taro fields) underscores the agricultural significance of taro, while the reference to ""ke ahi"" (the fire) may allude to rituals or symbolic purification. The dialogue between characters like Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i suggests a narrative involving ancestral figures, possibly from a mythological or genealogical tradition.  

**Linguistic Features**:  
- **Syntax and Structure**: The passage uses complex, parallel structures with repeated phrases like ""ā pau"" (on top of) and ""nā māla ‘elua"" (the two fields), which emphasize equivalence or comparison.  
- **Particles**: The use of ""e"" (locative) and ""ā"" (conjunction) highlights the grammatical precision of Hawaiian, where particles define relationships between nouns and verbs.  
- **Metaphor and Symbolism**: ""Huhuki ‘ana ā pau nā māla ‘elua"" (the full moon's action on the two fields) metaphorically ties the natural phenomenon of the full moon to the growth of taro, suggesting a divine or cyclical influence.  
- **Names and Identity**: Names like ""Nāmakaokapāo‘o,"" ""Pōka‘ī,"" and ""Puali‘i"" are likely ancestral or mythological figures, reflecting the importance of genealogy in Hawaiian storytelling.  

**Historical Significance**:  
The text may originate from a traditional oral narrative or a historical account tied to taro cultivation practices. The full moon's role in agricultural cycles (e.g., planting, harvesting) is well-documented in Hawaiian traditions, where lunar phases guided farming. The reference to ""ke ahi"" (the fire) could symbolize a sacred flame or a ritualistic element, possibly linked to offerings or spiritual ceremonies. The dialogue might represent a conflict or decision-making process, common in Hawaiian narratives where ancestral figures navigate moral or spiritual dilemmas.  

**Key Themes**:  
- **Sacred Agriculture**: Taro’s sacredness ties to its cultivation, with the full moon as a symbolic force for growth.  
- **Ancestral Roles**: The mention of ""makua kāne"" (father) and ""makuahine"" (mother) reflects the hierarchical and spiritual roles of family in Hawaiian society.  
- **Mythological Conflict**: The exchange between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i may mirror mythological disputes, where decisions about land, resources, or divine will are debated.  
</analysis>","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

They all knew, and they were silent in a place of silence for the sake of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! This is the ko‘ilipi in my hand, it is a thing of the night for this day, and the night, and then, the kālua with the ‘uala, and eat me first, and then, peace.” No one was listening to Nāmakaokapāo‘o in these words, and then Puali‘i spoke new words, which were the two. Puali‘i was careful to take Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the ko‘ilipi, in that time to pray for Nāmakaokapāo‘o in his prayer for Puali‘i. Thus he prayed: “Only the face of my pāo‘o, Be silent, be quiet here, Eat, let me eat. Let me rest, Nākukui‘aimakaokalani. That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani. This is my place of rest. Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i. Be gone, the hōhē is gone. Only people with the ihe. Only the ihe with the pahu. Only with Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”","This passage is rich with cultural, historical, and linguistic elements rooted in traditional Hawaiian practices. Here's a breakdown:

**Cultural Context:**
1. **Prayer and Rituals:** The text reflects the importance of prayer (*pule*) in Hawaiian culture, where invocations to deities or natural forces were central to activities like fishing, agriculture, or warfare. The phrase ""e he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale"" (Be gone, the hōhē is gone) may allude to a ritualistic dismissal of a spirit or a symbolic act of releasing a catch, aligning with the concept of *ʻāina* (land/earth) and *mo‘olelo* (stories/legends) that emphasize harmony with nature.
2. **Deities and Ancestral Figures:** Names like *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* likely reference deities or ancestral figures. *Kukui* (light, moon) and *Nāmaka* (sea) are common in Hawaiian mythology, suggesting a connection to oceanic or celestial deities. *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* might be a composite name combining *kukui* (light) and *aimaka* (a type of fish), while *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* could relate to the sea (*nāmaka*) and *okapāo‘o* (a term for a type of fish or a place name).
3. **Fishing and Resource Management:** The mention of *ko‘ilipi* (a type of fish) and *kālua* (a type of fish or a fishing net) highlights traditional Hawaiian fishing practices. The phrase ""kālua me ka ‘uala"" (kālua with the ‘uala) may refer to specific fishing techniques or tools, underscoring the cultural significance of sustainable resource use.

**Linguistic Features:**
1. **Syntax and Structure:** Hawaiian sentences often begin with verbs or nouns, as seen in ""Lālau akula ‘o Puali‘i"" (He was also taught by Puali‘i). The use of *e* as a particle for commands (""E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei"") is characteristic of invocations or prayers.
2. **Proper Nouns and Metaphors:** Names like *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* are likely metaphorical or symbolic, blending elements of nature (e.g., *nāmaka* for sea, *kukui* for light) with ancestral or divine titles. The repetition of *e* in the prayer (""E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha"") emphasizes urgency or emphasis, a common stylistic device in Hawaiian oratory.
3. **Poetic and Rhythmic Elements:** The prayer's structure mirrors traditional Hawaiian *mele* (poetry), with parallelism and alliteration. For example, ""E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale"" uses repetition for effect, a hallmark of Hawaiian oral traditions.

**Historical Significance:**
1. **Ancestral Practices:** The passage may originate from a *mo‘olelo* (legend) or *ʻōlelo no‘eau* (proverb) that illustrates the relationship between humans and deities in pre-colonial Hawaii. The act of ""taking"" (*‘o‘oki*) Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the ko‘ilipi could symbolize a spiritual or ritualistic transfer of power or responsibility.
2. **Names as Cultural Anchors:** The names *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* might be tied to specific historical events or genealogies. For instance, *Nāmakaokai‘a* (the great chief of Hawai‘i) could reference a ruling ali‘i (chief) or a legendary figure, reflecting the hierarchical structure of Hawaiian society.
3. **Symbolism of Elements:** The fire (*ke ahi*) and the sea (*nāmaka*) are recurring symbols in Hawaiian cosmology, representing transformation and life-giving forces. The phrase ""i luna o ke ahi"" (on the fire) might symbolize a sacred space or a metaphor for a trial or purification.

**Key Terms:**
- *Ko‘ilipi:* A type of fish, possibly a sacred or ritualistic term.
- *Pahu:* A fish species, but also a verb meaning ""to rest"" or ""to be silent,"" suggesting a dual meaning in the prayer.
- *Ihe:* A staff or spear, often used in rituals, symbolizing authority or a tool for spiritual connection.
- *Hōhē:* A term for a type of fish or a metaphor for a spiritual entity, possibly linked to the afterlife or ancestral spirits.

**Conclusion:**  
This passage exemplifies the integration of language, spirituality, and daily life in Hawaiian culture. The prayer structure, with its imperative verbs and symbolic references, reflects the deep reverence for natural resources and deities. The names and terms used here are not just labels but carry layered meanings tied to Hawaiian cosmology and social practices, emphasizing the interconnectedness of humans, nature, and the divine.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

The names *Nāmakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokai‘a* are tied to the ocean (*nāmaka*), reflecting their connection to the sea. *Nāmakaokalani* may mean ""the ocean's birth"" or ""the ocean's coming into being,"" while *Nāmakaokai‘a* could signify ""the ocean's child"" or ""the ocean's emergence."" The phrase *ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i* (""those two great chiefs of Hawai‘i"") highlights their status as high-ranking deities or ancestral figures. The structure *he makua kāne ‘o Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a* (""the father of Nāmakaokalani and the child of Nāmakaokai‘a"") suggests a parent-child relationship, possibly indicating a mythological pairing. The verb *ua komo i loko o ka pule* (""entered into the prayer"") may imply their incorporation into a sacred ritual or divine narrative, with *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* likely referring to a deity or a place associated with the ocean.  

**Cultural Context**:  
The names reflect the deep connection between Hawaiian cosmology and natural elements. *Nāmaka* (ocean) is central to many creation myths, symbolizing life and fertility. The pairing of *Nāmakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokai‘a* may represent dual aspects of the ocean—its origin and its manifestation—echoing the concept of *mo‘ohi* (duality) in Hawaiian thought. *Ali‘i nui* (great chiefs) underscores their role as divine ancestors, pivotal in the formation of the Hawaiian archipelago. The phrase *komo i loko o ka pule* (""entered into the prayer"") could allude to their deification or integration into sacred practices, a common motif in Hawaiian oral traditions.  

**Linguistic Features**:  
- **Relative Pronouns**: *ia* functions as a relative pronoun (""that is""), linking the names to their roles.  
- **Conjunction *a***: Used to connect *Nāmakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokai‘a*, emphasizing their paired identity.  
- **Verbal Aspect**: *ua komo* (past tense) indicates a completed action, suggesting their inclusion in the prayer as a historical or mythological event.  
- **Reduplication**: *Nāmakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* use reduplication (*-kalani* and *-pāo‘o*) to denote repetition or continuity, common in Hawaiian naming conventions.  

**Historical Significance**:  
This passage may originate from the *Kumulipo*, a creation chant that details the emergence of life from the ocean. *Nāmakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokai‘a* are often linked to the first beings born from the ocean, symbolizing the birth of the islands. *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* could be a variant of *Nāmakaokalani*, suggesting a recursive or cyclical creation narrative. The mention of ""great chiefs"" aligns with the *mo‘o* (guardians) of the islands, reflecting the hierarchical structure of Hawaiian society and its spiritual underpinnings.  

**Mythological Implications**:  
The pairing of father and child (*makua kāne* and *keiki*) may represent the first generation of deities, with *Nāmakaokalani* as the progenitor and *Nāmakaokai‘a* as the first offspring. Their ""entry into the prayer"" could symbolize their role as intermediaries between the divine and human realms, a concept central to *kīla* (rituals) and *mo‘olelo* (stories). The repetition of *Nāmaka* in the names reinforces the ocean's primacy in Hawaiian cosmology, as the source of all life.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p9,1,9,"A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o, i ia wā i  ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o, e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i  iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē.

The po‘o of Puali‘i arrived at Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Aloha to you, O Nāmakaokapāo‘o.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o also managed the po‘o of Puali‘i and governed the sea of Waipouli, located in the district of Honouliuli, his loa, five miles the loa.","This passage reflects a narrative rooted in Hawaiian oral tradition, blending spiritual, cultural, and geographical elements. Here’s a breakdown of its significance:  

**Cultural Context**:  
1. **Deities and Titles**: The names *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Puali‘i* likely refer to deities or ancestral figures. *Nāmaka* (sea) and *Puali‘i* (a name possibly linked to the ocean or navigation) suggest a connection to *Mo‘o* (a deity associated with water) or *Kāne* (a god of creation). *Po‘o* (darkness, or a title for a chief) may denote a sacred or spiritual domain, emphasizing the interplay between light/darkness and authority.  
2. **Ko‘ilipi**: This term might refer to a specific plant or ritual object, possibly tied to *kīla* (sacred staff) or *kū* (to stand), symbolizing spiritual power or governance.  
3. **Geographical References**: *Waipouli* (the sea of Pōhaku) and *Honouliuli* (a district in O‘ahu) anchor the text in real-world locations, linking the narrative to Hawaiian land divisions and sacred spaces. The mention of *loa* (miles) as a unit of measurement highlights traditional Hawaiian navigation and land surveying practices.  

**Linguistic Features**:  
1. **Syntax and Structure**: The passage uses a complex structure with multiple clauses, reflecting the poetic and recursive nature of Hawaiian language. For example, *“A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o”* (The prayer ended with Nāmakaokapāo‘o) employs *a* as a conjunction, while *“i ia wā”* (at that time) and *“iā Puali‘i”* (to Puali‘i) use prepositions to denote temporal and locative relationships.  
2. **Verbs and Particles**: *“Ho‘ohuli aku ā”* (to transfer) and *“kiola akula”* (to manage) use the *akula* suffix to indicate ongoing or habitual action. *“E”* as a topic marker emphasizes the subject, as in *“e Aloha ‘oe”* (Hello to you).  
3. **Proper Nouns**: The names *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Puali‘i* are likely *kupuna* (ancestors) or deities, with *okapāo‘o* (a suffix meaning ""to be in charge of"") suggesting a role of stewardship or leadership.  

**Historical Significance**:  
1. **Ritual and Governance**: The text may describe a ritual where spiritual authority (*pule*, prayer) is transferred from *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* to *Puali‘i*, symbolizing the delegation of sacred or territorial responsibilities. *Ko‘ilipi* could relate to a *kīla* (sacred staff) or *kū* (to stand), indicating a formal transfer of power.  
2. **Land Division and Navigation**: The reference to *kai o Waipouli* (the sea of Waipouli) and *Honouliuli* (a district in O‘ahu) ties the passage to ancient Hawaiian land management systems, where *kai* (sea) and *moku* (district) were critical for resource allocation and navigation.  
3. **Measurement Units**: *Loa* (miles) as a unit of length reflects the use of traditional Hawaiian measurements, which were often tied to natural landmarks or spiritual concepts. The phrase *“‘elima mile ka loa”* (five miles the loa) may allude to a sacred boundary or a metaphorical distance in a mythic context.  

**Symbolism and Themes**:  
- **Darkness and Light**: *Po‘o* (darkness) and *Aloha* (love, peace) juxtapose opposing forces, a common motif in Hawaiian cosmology, where *po* (night) and *ao* (day) represent dualities.  
- **Sacred Ownership**: The transfer of *ko‘ilipi* (possibly a sacred object or land) to *Puali‘i* underscores the importance of *kuleana* (responsibility) and *kapu* (sacred law) in Hawaiian society.  
- **Ancestral Legacy**: The repetition of *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Puali‘i* may reference genealogical ties or the veneration of ancestors in Hawaiian mythology.  

This passage likely originates from a *mele* (chant) or *mo‘oleo* (narrative), preserving a mythic or historical account of spiritual and territorial authority. The interplay of names, verbs, and measurements highlights the interconnectedness of Hawaiian cosmology, geography, and governance.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

He said: “O chief! There was a very strong child of ‘u‘uku. His father died, and his head was buried in the sea. It was a very deep place, a depth of five miles. But the place of ‘Ama‘u, there was strength and he died there. Therefore, he died there without strength. He spoke in Waikīkī. Only Nāmakaokapāo‘o was said in these words.”","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant.

The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",
