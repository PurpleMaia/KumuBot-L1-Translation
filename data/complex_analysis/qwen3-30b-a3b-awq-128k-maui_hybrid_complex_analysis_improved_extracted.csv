Kauluakaha‘i, his father, for Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī is the mother. He is a great chief for Kahikipapaialewa, and a priest of one.","• The passage uses symbolic names and elements to reflect the tension between traditional Hawaiian cosmology and post-contact social transformations.  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o) translates to ""The Opened One of the Extended Ones,"" suggesting a metaphor for enlightenment or expansion, possibly tied to the ""u‘uku"" fish, which in Hawaiian lore symbolizes abundance and spiritual connection.  
  – The duality of ""two of these"" (‘a‘ohe ona lua) may allegorically represent the two realms of existence (earth and sky) or the merging of human and divine forces, a common theme in Hawaiian creation myths.  

• Names as cultural symbols:  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (Nā = plural, Maka = eye, o = of, ka-pāo‘o = extended one). This could imply ""The Opened Eyes of the Extended One,"" symbolizing vision or foresight in navigating the spiritual and physical worlds.  
  – **Kauluakaha‘i**: ""Kau-lu-a-kaha‘i"" (Kau = to stretch, lu = to extend, a = and, kaha‘i = name). Suggests ""The Extender and the One Who Stretches,"" reflecting the role of a leader or ancestor in expanding territory or knowledge.  
  – **Kahikipapaialewa**: ""Kahi-pa-pa-i-lewa"" (Kahi = a, pa = to place, papa = board, i = in, lewa = to be high). May denote ""A Place of the Elevated Board,"" symbolizing a sacred or elevated space, possibly linked to the kapu system’s rituals.  
  – **Pōka‘ī**: ""Pō-ka‘ī"" (Pō = night, ka‘ī = name). ""Night’s One"" could allude to a guardian of the unseen or a figure associated with the spiritual realm, contrasting with the ""koa"" (tree) symbolizing strength and warriors.  
  – **Kahikinu‘u**: ""Kahi-ki-nu‘u"" (Kahi = a, ki = to, nu‘u = high). ""A High Place of the Foreigner"" (Kahiki = foreign) may allegorically represent the encroachment of Western influence, a theme post-1820 missionary contact.  

• Historical and cultural context:  
  – The mention of ""u‘uku"" (fish) and ""koa"" (tree) connects to the *‘Ai Kapu* era, where natural resources were governed by strict kapu (sacred laws). The ""two of these"" could reflect the dualities of Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., *mo‘o* and *moana*, land and sea), but also the disruption of these systems by colonialism.  
  – ""Kahikinu‘u"" (foreign high place) may critique the post-1820 shift as missionaries introduced foreign concepts, replacing indigenous *mo‘o* (land) and *moana* (ocean) with colonial land divisions.  
  – The term ""ao‘ao akua kekahi ona"" (a priest of one) highlights the erosion of the traditional *kānaka‘aumakua* (priesthood) structure, as missionaries later redefined religious authority.  

• Social commentary and allegory:  
  – The ""strong child in its young days"" (keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio) may allegorically depict the resilience of Hawaiian society during the *Ai Kapu* era, while the ""long ‘u‘uku"" symbolizes the enduring spiritual ties to the ocean.  
  – The names ""Kauluakaha‘i"" (father) and ""Pōka‘ī"" (mother) could represent the fusion of male and female energies, but their association with ""Kahikipapaialewa"" (a land in Kahikinu‘u) critiques the displacement of traditional *ʻāina* (land) by foreign concepts of ownership and hierarchy.  
  – The narrative’s focus on ""Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau"" (Hawai‘i and Ni‘ihau) may symbolize the fragmentation of Hawaiian identity, as Ni‘ihau, a remote island, became a site of cultural preservation but also isolation under colonialism.  

• Numerical symbolism:  
  – The number ""two"" (lua) in ""‘a‘ohe ona lua"" reflects the Hawaiian *mo‘o* (land) and *moana* (ocean) duality, but also the ""two"" in the *kānaka‘aumakua* (priesthood) and *mo‘i* (monarch) roles, which were later undermined by missionary influence.  
  – ""Loa"" (long) in ""keiki ‘u‘uku loa"" may allude to the *loa* (spirit world) and the *ʻōpiʻopio* (young days), symbolizing the transition from ancestral to modern times.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This chapter weaves together themes of sacredness, lineage, and the interplay between human and divine realms in Hawaiian culture. Central to the narrative is Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a powerful ‘u‘uku fish and ancestral figure, whose story is intertwined with the spiritual and cultural practices of the islands. The text emphasizes the reverence for taro (kalo), a staple crop and sacred plant symbolizing the connection between humans and the divine, as seen in the naming of taro fields and the ritualistic protection of them. The characters Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i represent key figures in the lineage of chiefs and priests, highlighting the importance of genealogy and the role of ali‘i (noble class) in maintaining sacred traditions. 

The chapter’s historical and cultural context reflects the deep-rooted Hawaiian values of mana (spiritual power), mo‘olelo (mythology and history), and the sacredness of natural resources. The mention of specific locations like Honouliuli, Waipouli, and Kaua underscores the geographic and spiritual significance of these areas in Hawaiian cosmology. Rituals, such as the transfer of sacred objects (ko‘ilipi) and the invocation of gods, illustrate the centrality of spiritual practices in governance and daily life. The tragic fate of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, who is killed by the people of Kaua, serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of challenging divine or ancestral authority, reinforcing themes of balance, respect for the sacred, and the inevitability of fate.

In Hawaiian literature, this chapter exemplifies the oral tradition’s use of metaphor, symbolism, and genealogical narratives to convey moral and spiritual lessons. The repetition of names and the interplay between human and divine elements (e.g., Pōka‘ī as both a chief and a priest, Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s transformation into a fish) reflect the cultural emphasis on interconnectedness and the cyclical nature of life and death. The significance lies in its preservation of ancient beliefs, the veneration of taro as a sacred resource, and the exploration of power dynamics between ali‘i, deities, and the natural world. The narrative’s cohesion emerges from its focus on sacred duty, ancestral legacy, and the tension between human ambition and divine will, making it a vital piece of Hawaiian cultural heritage."

Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","• [Allegorical interpretation of birth and transition]  
  – The passage symbolizes the cultural and spiritual rebirth of a new era in Hawaiian society, reflecting the shift from the 'Ai Kapu (sacred law) system to the post-contact reforms. The ""birth"" of Nāmakaokapāo‘o represents the emergence of a new generation shaped by colonial influences and internal conflict.  
  – The phrase ""ma laila lāua i launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho"" (they were caught in a fight and slept, and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o) may allegorically depict the turmoil of the 1819–1820s, when the abolition of 'Ai Kapu and missionary arrival disrupted traditional structures. The ""sleep"" could signify a period of dormancy or resistance before the ""birth"" of a transformed cultural identity.  

• [Symbolism of names and their etymology]  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (plural eyes-of-the-pāo‘o). ""Maka"" (eyes) and ""pāo‘o"" (a type of fish or a name) may symbolize vision or guidance, possibly linked to the goddess Nāmaka (sea deity), suggesting a connection to oceanic resources or spiritual insight.  
  – **Pōka‘ī**: ""Pō-ka‘ī"" (night-alone). Reflects the ""night"" of the old kapu system, with ""ka‘ī"" (solitude) implying isolation or the end of a traditional order.  
  – **Kauluakaha‘i**: ""Kau-luakaha-i"" (plant-path-i). ""Kau"" (to plant) and ""luakaha"" (to clear a path) may signify the act of re-establishing or ""planting"" new social norms, allegorically representing the post-1820 missionary influence and the reconfiguration of Hawaiian society.  

• [Historical and cultural context]  
  – The reference to ""kino ai"" (people and) and ""moe ‘ana iho"" (sleeping) aligns with the 1819 abolition of 'Ai Kapu, where the collapse of the old system led to a ""sleep"" of traditional practices, followed by the ""birth"" of a new social order.  
  – ""Noho ihola ‘o Pōka‘ī me kona hāpai"" (while Pōka‘ī with his wife) may allude to the erosion of gender roles under missionary influence, where ""hāpai"" (to take) could imply the transfer of power or cultural authority.  
  – The term ""‘ilihune"" (a type of fish) ties to the sacredness of marine resources in Hawaiian cosmology, but its mention here might critique the shift from traditional resource management to Western practices, as seen in post-contact reforms.  

• [Post-contact social commentary]  
  – The narrative reflects tensions between traditional values and missionary-driven changes, such as the 1820s abolition of kapu and the introduction of Christianity. The ""birth"" of Nāmakaokapāo‘o symbolizes the hybridization of Hawaiian culture, blending indigenous and foreign elements.  
  – The name ""Kauluakaha‘i"" (planting a path) could critique the imposition of Western agriculture and land ownership, which disrupted the ahupua‘a system. This aligns with the ""return to his land"" motif, highlighting the loss of traditional sovereignty.  
  – Numerical symbolism: The repetition of ""ma"" (in) and ""iho"" (down) may allude to the three stages of Hawaiian history: pre-contact (Pōka‘ī), post-1819 transition (Kauluakaha‘i), and post-missionary rebirth (Nāmakaokapāo‘o).  

• [Cultural symbolism of 'āina and 'ai kapu]  
  – ""‘Āina"" (land) is central to Hawaiian identity, representing life and ancestral connection. The return of Kauluakaha‘i to his ""‘āina"" could symbolize the struggle to preserve land and sovereignty amid colonial pressures.  
  – The ""birth"" of Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the context of ""‘ilihune loa"" (great ‘ilihune) may reference the sacredness of fish in traditional Hawaiian diets, but also the disruption of these practices by Western influence.  
  – Scholars like Kuykendall (1958) note that 'Ai Kapu governed food and social hierarchies, and this passage might mirror the collapse of such systems, with ""kino ai"" (people and) as a metaphor for the merging of old and new social structures.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

A ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘ī me kāna kāne me  Puali‘i ā ke kula o Keahumoa, noho.","There they reside, down in the area of Puali‘i, a good man from Līhu‘e, in the district of Honouliuli, in the house of Pōka‘ī. Puali‘i approaches Pōka‘ī and asks him, saying: “I will ask you about a woman (here).” Pōka‘ī replies: “How will you ask me about her? I have children, and my son is [something].” Pōka‘ī says: “Those things are nothing, you ask me, let us sleep.” Then Pōka‘ī returns with his husband and Puali‘i and the garden of Keahumoa, resides.","• The narrative reflects the collapse of traditional Hawaiian social structures and the imposition of foreign values post-1819  
  – The 'Ai Kapu (sacred meal system) was abolished in 1819 by Kamehameha II, marking a shift from kapu (sacred laws) to Western influence. The dialogue between Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī mirrors tensions between indigenous traditions and foreign ideologies.  
  – Pōka‘ī’s mention of “children” and “son” (kūna) symbolizes the traditional family structure, which was disrupted by missionary-driven reforms that redefined gender roles and kinship.  

• Symbolism of names and locations:  
  – **Pōka‘ī**: “Pō” (night) + “ka‘ī” (edge, boundary). Represents the twilight of traditional practices, as “night” often symbolizes endings or the unknown in Hawaiian cosmology.  
  – **Puali‘i**: “Pau” (end, completion) + “li‘i” (to be in a place). Suggests a transition or conclusion, possibly reflecting the end of an era or the “completion” of cultural change.  
  – **Keahumoa**: “Kea” (crow, metaphor for a leader) + “humoa” (to grow, cultivate). May symbolize the introduction of Western agricultural methods (e.g., missionary gardens) or the “growth” of Christianity, displacing indigenous practices.  

• Historical and cultural context of 1819–1820:  
  – The abolition of 'Ai Kapu in 1819 dismantled the rigid social and religious structures of pre-contact Hawaii, leading to the erosion of sacred taboos. Pōka‘ī’s reference to his “son” could allude to the loss of genealogical continuity under foreign influence.  
  – The phrase “e moe kāua” (let us sleep) may metaphorically signify the end of traditional practices, as sleep in Hawaiian lore often represents death or the passage of time. This aligns with the post-1820 period, where missionary activity and Westernization suppressed indigenous rituals.  

• Allegorical critique of cultural erasure:  
  – Puali‘i’s question about a “woman” (wahine) could symbolize the loss of female autonomy in a patriarchal colonial system. The term “wahine” (woman) in this context might critique the gendered impacts of missionary policies that marginalized women’s roles.  
  – The garden of Keahumoa (Keahumoa) may represent the displacement of traditional ahupua‘a (land divisions) by foreign land ownership systems, reflecting the broader theme of resource control and cultural assimilation.  

• Post-contact biases and hybridity:  
  – The text’s structure and dialogue hint at a hybrid narrative influenced by missionary scribes, who often reinterpreted oral traditions through a Christian lens. The phrase “He mea ‘ole ia mau mea” (“These things are nothing”) may reflect colonial narratives dismissing indigenous knowledge as “nothing” in favor of Western frameworks.  
  – The mention of “husband” (kāne) alongside Puali‘i’s name could indicate a blending of traditional Hawaiian gender roles (e.g., kumu (teacher) and kāne (male)) with foreign concepts of marriage, suggesting a cultural collision.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

At that time, Puali‘i went to the sea of Honouliuli to catch fish and taro.","• The passage reflects the transition from the traditional kapu system to post-contact societal changes, symbolizing the collapse of religious and social hierarchies.  
  – The ""Ai Kapu era"" (pre-1819) emphasizes rigid structures, while the mention of ""noa"" (freedom) and ""iho akula"" (to go) suggests a shift toward new practices under missionary influence after 1820.  
  – The abandonment of kapu in 1819, as documented by Kamakau (1992), mirrors the narrative’s depiction of leaving behind old systems.  

• Symbolism of ""Puali‘i"" and ""Pōka‘ī"" as allegorical figures.  
  – ""Puali‘i"": ""Pua"" (flower) + ""li"" (to be, to become), suggesting ""the one who becomes the flower of the sea"" or a deity of the ocean.  
  – ""Pōka‘ī"": ""Pō"" (night) + ""ka‘ī"" (to be), symbolizing ""the rest of the night"" or a figure tied to cyclical time, reflecting the interplay between human and divine in Hawaiian cosmology.  

• The name ""Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" as a metaphor for resource management and cultural identity.  
  – ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"": ""Nā"" (plural) + ""maka"" (eye, as in ""mālama"" [care] and ""maka"" [eye] as a symbol of observation.  
  – ""Ka-pāo‘o"" (the place of the pāo‘o, a type of fish or a term for a boundary marker) may signify the intersection of land and sea, highlighting the importance of resource boundaries in traditional Hawaiian governance.  

• The act of ""catching fish and taro"" at Honouliuli’s sea critiques the shift from agricultural to maritime subsistence.  
  – Honouliuli, a historically significant fishpond area, represents the integration of traditional aquaculture with new practices under foreign influence.  
  – The phrase ""lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala"" (to catch fish and taro) may allegorically depict the tension between land-based (taro as sacred staple) and sea-based (fish as alternative sustenance) resource systems.  

• The ""two taro fields"" as a numerical symbol of duality in Hawaiian cosmology.  
  – The number two often signifies balance (e.g., male/female, land/sea) in Hawaiian thought, aligning with the kapu system’s emphasis on harmony.  
  – The abandonment of these fields in 1819 could symbolize the dissolution of traditional land divisions, as missionaries introduced new agricultural models.  

• The role of ""kapa ‘ia ka inoa"" (named) in cultural memory.  
  – Naming practices in Hawaiian tradition (e.g., ""Namakaokapāo‘o"") encode ancestral and ecological knowledge.  
  – The persistence of such names in post-contact narratives may reflect efforts to preserve indigenous identity amid foreign influence, as seen in the work of Kuykendall (1953).","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

They reached the taro fields, as they were with the children, “Catch the roots of the taro completely on top, let none grow.” Therefore, only the children are, thus, the small ones in the taro, no need to catch the root.","• [Allegorical interpretation of the guardian and children]  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o (clear-eyed guardian) symbolizes the traditional Hawaiian kapu system, which enforced strict social and spiritual regulations. The ""double in form"" (‘elua kapua‘i) may allude to the dualities of life, such as the physical and spiritual realms, or the balance between human and divine.  
  – The phrase “did not mend its work” (‘a‘ole i pa‘a kona ma‘i) could represent the collapse of the kapu system after Kamehameha II’s death in 1819, when the kapu were abolished, leading to societal upheaval.  

• [Symbolism of taro and fish in Hawaiian cosmology]  
  – Taro (‘uala) is central to Hawaiian identity, as it is the ancestor of humanity (from the story of Hina and the first human). The ""taro fields"" (māla ‘uala) symbolize the foundation of life and sustenance.  
  – The ""fish"" (lawai‘a) here may represent abundance or the ocean’s role in sustaining life, but also allude to the ""Ai Kapu"" era, where fish were restricted under kapu laws.  

• [Etymology and cultural significance of names]  
  – *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*: “Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o” (clear eyes of the pāo‘o fish). Pāo‘o (pāo‘o) is a type of fish, but also means “to be open” or “to be clear,” suggesting insight or spiritual awareness.  
  – *Puali‘i*: “Pu‘i” (to grow, to flourish) + “li” (suffix). May imply “one who grows” or “the flourishing one,” linking to the sacredness of taro as a life-giving crop.  

• [Historical context: Transition from kapu to missionary influence]  
  – The narrative reflects the post-1820 shift after the abolition of the kapu system. The guardian’s failure to mend their work (kona ma‘i) mirrors the disintegration of traditional governance, replaced by missionary teachings that redefined social practices.  
  – The instruction to “catch the roots of the taro completely on top” (huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala) may critique the rigid agricultural practices of the kapu era, which were later relaxed under missionary influence, allowing for more communal farming.  

• [Numerical symbolism and riddles]  
  – “‘Elua” (two) and “kapua‘i” (double) may reference the dual nature of existence in Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., physical and spiritual worlds) or the two pillars of society: ali‘i (chief) and mo‘i (ruler). The number two also appears in the *mo‘olelo* (mythology) as a symbol of balance.  
  – “Kāohi mālie” (small and calm) could symbolize the marginalized or oppressed, reflecting the displacement of traditional leaders by missionaries and the new social order.  

• [Social commentary on power and transformation]  
  – The guardian’s “mistake in its smallness” (me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e) may allegorically represent the fragility of the kapu system, which could not sustain itself after foreign contact. The children’s role as “small ones” (kāohi mālie) critiques the erosion of traditional knowledge, as missionaries prioritized literacy and Western values over indigenous practices.  
  – The phrase “no need to catch the root” (‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e) could symbolize the shift from ritualistic to practical agricultural methods, aligning with missionary efforts to modernize Hawaiian society.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Thus, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went to the fire, burning the two taro plants on the sacred ground. Then, his male parent, the elder, went down, and he went to his mother. To Pōka‘ī: “No.” Puali‘i replied: “Yes, the head and the eyes of the thing that will eat my taro on this day, therefore, that day will make him.”","• [Allegorical interpretation of the passage]  
  – The act of ""covering all the taro fields"" symbolizes the protection or concealment of sacred resources, reflecting the traditional Hawaiian concept of *kuleana* (responsibility) to preserve *kuleana* (rights) of the land. The two taro plants on the ""sacred place"" may represent the duality of life and death, or the balance between human and divine realms.  
  – The dialogue between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and his parents mirrors the tension between *kapu* (sacred law) and *alii* (chiefly authority), a recurring theme in pre-contact Hawaiian narratives where decisions about sacred resources were often tied to spiritual and social hierarchies.  

• [Analysis of character names and symbolism]  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: ""Nā"" (the), ""makahina"" (to be clear, to purify), ""pāo‘o"" (a place, possibly a name). The name may imply ""The Clearer of the Pāo‘o,"" where *pāo‘o* could symbolize a boundary or sacred space, suggesting a figure tasked with maintaining spiritual order.  
  – **Pōka‘ī**: ""Pō"" (night, darkness), ""kā‘ī"" (to be still, to rest). The name may allude to the ""Stillness of Night,"" representing a moment of decision or moral ambiguity.  
  – **Puali‘i**: ""Pua"" (flower, blossom), ""li‘i"" (to be small, to diminish). The name could symbolize ""The Diminishing Blossom,"" hinting at the erosion of traditional values or the fragility of cultural practices under external pressures.  

• [Historical and cultural context]  
  – The reference to ""sacred place"" (*kapuahi*) connects to the *Ai Kapu* era (pre-contact, 1819), where taro (*kalo*) was considered a *aumakua* (deity) and its cultivation was deeply spiritual. Burning taro plants might symbolize the disruption of sacred rituals or the collapse of the kapu system.  
  – The numerical symbolism of ""two"" (*‘elua*) and ""head and eyes"" (*po‘o me nā maka*) reflects the Hawaiian cosmological concept of *mo‘okūauhau* (genealogical lineage) and the importance of *kūkulu* (structure) in maintaining social order. The dialogue may critique the erosion of traditional governance post-1820, as missionary influence introduced new values conflicting with *kapu*.  

• [Social commentary and critique]  
  – The conflict between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and his parents mirrors the societal upheaval during the *Ai Kapu* abolition (1819), where the destruction of sacred practices led to cultural dissonance. The ""head and eyes"" of the taro could allegorically represent the loss of cultural identity and spiritual vision.  
  – The use of *ahi* (fire) as a metaphor for transformation or destruction highlights the tension between preservation and change, a theme central to post-contact Hawaiian history. The narrative may reflect anxieties about the future of *ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi* (Hawaiian language) and *loco iʻa* (traditional fishponds) under missionary influence.  

• [Post-contact biases and narrative transitions]  
  – The phrase ""that day will make him"" (*eia kona lā e make ai ia‘u*) may allude to the 1820s missionary arrival, which ""made"" (transformed) Hawaiian society. The passive construction (*e make ai*) could indicate a critique of how external forces imposed new systems, eroding indigenous autonomy.  
  – The dialogue's ambiguity (""No"" vs. ""Yes"") reflects the uncertainty of the era, where traditional *mo‘okūauhau* (genealogical) ties were challenged by Christian morality and Western concepts of ownership.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

They fully understood the children, and they were placed in a sacred place for the protection of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! This is the ko‘ilipi in my hand, a sacred object for the gods in this era, and the land of the gods, and then, the canoe with the taro, and I will eat first, and then, it is free.” There was no one to question Nāmakaokapāo‘o in these words, and then Puali‘i spoke anew: “Only the eye of my sacred place. Hapupu‘u, come to me for protection. Eat, perhaps, leave, perhaps. Leave, perhaps, Nākukui‘aimakaokalani. That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani. This is my sacred place. Nāmakaokai‘a is the high chief of Hawai‘i. Come, the hōhē is free. Only people with the ihe. Only the ihe is with the pahu. Only with Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”","• [Allegorical interpretation of the ko‘ilipi as a sacred object symbolizing cultural continuity]  
  – The ""ko‘ilipi"" (possibly a variant of ""kō‘ili‘i,"" a sacred object or ritual item) represents the traditional Hawaiian kapu system, which governed social and spiritual order. Its placement in Puali‘i’s hand signifies the transmission of cultural authority.  
  – The ""four waves of the sea"" (āna ‘ehā) may allegorically reference the four sacred directions or the four elements (earth, water, fire, air), emphasizing the interconnectedness of Hawaiian cosmology.  

• [Symbolism of names: Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o]  
  – **Puali‘i**: Breakdown: *Pua* (flower, symbolizing growth or vitality) + *li‘i* (to be small, young, or humble). Represents a figure of emerging power or a new generation navigating tradition.  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (the great eye of the sea). ""Maka"" (eye) and ""pāo‘o"" (great) suggest a guardian of the ocean, possibly linked to Pele (volcanic deity) or other deities of the sea, symbolizing protection and ancestral wisdom.  
  – **Kukui‘aimakaokalani**: *Kukui* (light, source of light) + *aimaka* (white) + *okalani* (place of). Likely references a deity of light or a sacred place, possibly Kukui (goddess of lightning) or a localized variant, symbolizing enlightenment or divine authority.  

• [Historical context: Post-1819 cultural shifts and missionary influence]  
  – The mention of ""pule make"" (prayer for protection) and the ""ko‘ilipi"" may reflect tensions during the **Ai Kapu era (1819)**, when Kamehameha II abolished the kapu system, disrupting traditional religious practices. The narrative could allegorically depict the struggle to preserve sacred objects amid societal change.  
  – The phrase ""make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" (only with Nāmakaokapāo‘o) may critique the erosion of indigenous authority, as missionaries later marginalized ali‘i (chiefs) and introduced new hierarchies.  

• [Numerical symbolism: The ""four waves"" (āna ‘ehā)]  
  – The number four (āna ‘ehā) is significant in Hawaiian cosmology, representing the four sacred directions (*kūmūho‘ō*) and the four elements. This reinforces the idea of balance and the cyclical nature of life, contrasting with the disruptive ""abandonment"" of kapu.  
  – The ""canoe with the taro"" (*kālua me ka ‘uala*) symbolizes sustenance and migration, linking to the sacred plant *‘uala* (taro) as the ancestor of the Hawaiian people (*kānuu ka po‘o*—the sacred lineage).  

• [Cultural practices and social commentary]  
  – The ""ihi"" (sacred place) where the children are ""kū maila"" (placed) may reference *heiau* (temples) or *mo’okū’auhau* (sacred spaces), highlighting the sanctity of such locations in pre-contact Hawaiian society.  
  – The dialogue’s ambiguity (""e ‘ai paha, e waiho paha"") reflects the tension between old and new beliefs, as the arrival of missionaries introduced uncertainty, leading to the decline of traditional practices.  

• [Post-contact biases and hybridity]  
  – The structure of the prayer (""Aloha wale ka maka..."") may blend pre-contact invocations with later Christian influences, as missionaries often reinterpreted Hawaiian terms. For example, ""pule"" (prayer) could be conflated with Christian liturgy.  
  – The term ""ihe"" (staff or sacred object) and ""pahu"" (canoe or ritual object) might symbolize the fusion of indigenous and foreign symbols in a post-contact context, reflecting cultural hybridity.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

Nāmakaokalani is the father and Nāmakaokai‘a is the child. Therefore, they entered into the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","• The passage encodes a dualistic cosmology reflecting the interplay between celestial and marine realms  
  – The names ""Nāmakaokalani"" (Eyes of the Sky) and ""Nāmakaokai‘a"" (Eyes of the Fish) symbolize the union of sky (Kahiko, the god of the heavens) and ocean (Kanaloa, the god of the sea), foundational elements in Hawaiian creation narratives  
  – The term ""ali‘i nui lāua"" (great ali‘i of Hawai‘i) highlights the sacred authority of the ruling class as mediators between divine and human worlds  

• Etymology and symbolic resonance of names  
  – **Nāmakaokalani**: ""Nā-maka-o-ka-lani"" (the eyes of the heavens) – ""maka"" (eyes) as metaphor for perception, ""lani"" (sky) as divine realm  
  – **Nāmakaokai‘a**: ""Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a"" (the eyes of the fish) – ""i‘a"" (fish) referencing the ocean's life-giving power, with ""maka"" (eyes) suggesting spiritual vision  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (eyes of the prayer) – ""pāo‘o"" (prayer) as a sacred act, linking the names to ritual practices  

• Historical and cultural context of the 'Ai Kapu system  
  – The ""ali‘i nui"" (great chiefs) were central to the 'Ai Kapu (sacred dietary laws) that governed social hierarchy and spiritual practices pre-1819  
  – The phrase ""ua komo i loko o ka pule"" (entered into the prayer) may allude to the ritual incorporation of ali‘i into sacred spaces, a practice tied to the 'Ai Kapu's emphasis on maintaining sacred order  
  – Post-1820 missionary influence might have reinterpreted such terms through Christian lenses, though the structure here preserves pre-contact cosmology  

• Numerical symbolism and genealogical structure  
  – The ""two names"" (""kēlā mau inoa ‘elua"") reflect the Hawaiian concept of *mo‘olelo* (history) as a duality, mirroring the creation of the world from the union of sky and ocean  
  – The father-son relationship (""makua kāne"" and ""keiki"") underscores the hereditary transmission of spiritual and political power, a key feature of the ali‘i class  

• Social commentary on power and transformation  
  – The text critiques the rigid hierarchy of the 'Ai Kapu era by depicting ali‘i as both divine and mortal, their roles fluid between sacred and temporal realms  
  – ""Entering the prayer"" may symbolize the absorption of secular power into spiritual frameworks, a tension that would later be disrupted by 1819 abolition of kapu and missionary reforms","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i.

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

  – [The text reflects the disruption of traditional Hawaiian spiritual and political systems during the transition from the 'Ai Kapu era to post-contact colonial influences.]  
  – [The act of transferring sacred items (ko‘i) and altering language (‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē) symbolizes the erosion of indigenous knowledge and the imposition of foreign cultural practices.]  

• [Analysis of character names or symbolism]  
  – [Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o: ""Nā-maka"" (the sea) + ""o-ka-pāo‘o"" (of the calm one), suggesting a connection to the ocean’s tranquility and spiritual guardianship.]  
  – [Puali‘i: ""Pau-ali‘i"" (completed chief), implying a figure of authority or completion, possibly representing a new order or the end of an era.]  
  – [Numerical symbolism: ""Five miles"" (‘elima mile) may allude to the five sacred directions (north, south, east, west, center) in Hawaiian cosmology, signifying a journey into a new spiritual or social framework.]  

• [Historical or cultural context point]  
  – [The 'Ai Kapu system (1819 abandonment) and post-missionary era (1820s onward) are referenced through the disruption of rituals and the introduction of foreign languages.]  
  – [The phrase ""kiola akula i kai o Waipouli"" (sailing to the sea of Waipouli) could parallel the historical movement of ali‘i (chiefs) and kahuna (priests) during territorial expansions or conflicts, such as during Kamehameha I’s unification of the islands.]  
  – [The mention of ""kai o Waipouli"" (sea of Waipouli) and ""kahakai o Honouliuli"" (waters of Honouliuli) ties the narrative to specific geographic and spiritual sites, which were central to Hawaiian rituals and governance.]  

• [Cultural symbolism and social critique]  
  – [The ""ko‘i"" (sacred items) may represent the kapu system’s sacredness, with their transfer to Puali‘i symbolizing the collapse of traditional religious structures after 1819.]  
  – [The dialogue ""Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" (Hello to you, O Nāmakaokapāo‘o) highlights the tension between Hawaiian and foreign languages, reflecting the post-contact shift toward English and the marginalization of native practices.]  
  – [The ""five miles the loa"" (‘elima mile ka loa) could allegorically signify the distance between traditional values and the new colonial order, emphasizing cultural displacement.]  

• [Etymology and allegorical meanings]  
  – [Nāmakaokapāo‘o: ""Nā-maka"" (the sea) + ""o-ka-pāo‘o"" (of the calm one), suggesting a guardian of the ocean’s peace, possibly linked to the goddess Nāmaka, associated with the sea and conflict.]  
  – [Puali‘i: ""Pau-ali‘i"" (complete chief), symbolizing the end of a cycle or the rise of a new leader, potentially reflecting the consolidation of power under Kamehameha or the influence of missionaries.]  
  – [The term ""loa"" (distance, to move) may imply a journey of transformation, aligning with the concept of ""ho‘ohuli"" (transfer) as a metaphor for cultural or political change.]  

• [Post-contact influences and biases]  
  – [The narrative’s mention of ""different language"" (‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē) critiques the erosion of the Hawaiian language and the imposition of English, a consequence of missionary activity post-1820.]  
  – [The structure of the text mirrors the historical fragmentation of traditional governance, as foreign systems replaced the kapu structure, reflecting societal upheaval.]  
  – [The allegorical journey to ""Honouliuli"" (a site of historical significance) may symbolize the loss of sacred lands to foreign interests, a theme central to post-contact Hawaiian history.]","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",
