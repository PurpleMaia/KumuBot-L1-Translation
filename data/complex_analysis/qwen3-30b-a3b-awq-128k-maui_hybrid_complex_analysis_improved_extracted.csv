‘O Pōka‘ī ka makuahine.  
He ali‘i nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa, a he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona.","• [Allegorical representation of lineage and divine authority]  
  – The passage uses the term ""keiki ‘u‘uku loa"" (great fish child) to symbolize a figure of immense power and connection to the ocean, a central element in Hawaiian cosmology. The ""u‘uku"" (fish) is often linked to Mo‘ōpuna (progeny) of the gods, reflecting the sacredness of the sea in Hawaiian creation myths.  
  – ""Ko koa loa"" (great koa) references the koa tree, sacred to the warrior class, suggesting the child embodies both spiritual and martial strength.  

• [Analysis of character names and symbolism]  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (Sea of the Child of the Pāo‘o). ""Nāmaka"" (sea) and ""pāo‘o"" (a name or term meaning ""to be silent"" or ""to rest"") may symbolize a guardian of the ocean’s mysteries or a mediator between divine and human realms.  
  – **Kauluakaha‘i**: ""Kau-lu-akaha‘i"" (The one who breaks the path). ""Kau"" (to break) and ""lu"" (to cut) suggest a figure associated with transformation or challenging boundaries, possibly reflecting a leader who disrupts tradition for progress.  
  – **Kahikipapaialewa**: ""Kahi-kapa-pa-i-lewa"" (The place of the chief’s breaking). ""Kahi"" (place) and ""papai"" (to break) may allude to a site of historical or ritual significance, such as a conflict between ali‘i (chief) and the kapu system.  

• [Historical and cultural context: Pre-Contact to Post-Contact transitions]  
  – The reference to ""ao‘ao akua kekahi ona"" (a certain divine law) points to the **‘Ai Kapu era** (the kapu system), which governed social and religious life before 1819. This aligns with the pre-contact period, where divine laws (‘ao‘ao akua) dictated resource management, social hierarchy, and rituals.  
  – The mention of ""Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau"" (Hawaii to Niihau) highlights the **geographical duality** of the archipelago, symbolizing the balance between the Big Island (Hawaii) and the smaller, more isolated Ni‘ihau. This duality may reflect the tension between centralized power (Hawaii) and peripheral territories (Ni‘ihau) during the rise of the Māori dynasty.  
  – The term ""ali‘i nui"" (great chief) underscores the **hierarchical structure** of Hawaiian society, where chiefs were seen as divine intermediaries. The narrative’s focus on lineage and land (""he ‘āina"") may critique the rigidities of the kapu system, which were abolished in 1819, leading to shifts in power dynamics.  

• [Numerical symbolism and social commentary]  
  – ""‘a‘ohe ona lua"" (two islands) symbolizes the **duality of existence** (mo‘olelo) in Hawaiian cosmology, such as the union of land and sea or the balance between spiritual and temporal realms. This reflects the cultural emphasis on harmony (‘āina and moana).  
  – The structure of the text with nested labels (a), b1), c), etc.) mirrors the **oral storytelling tradition**, where layered narratives conveyed moral and historical lessons. This could critique the erosion of traditional knowledge systems after 1820 due to missionary influence and Westernization.  
  – The child’s ""ikaika loa"" (great strength) and ""ko koa loa"" (great koa) may allegorically represent the **resilience of Hawaiian sovereignty** against colonial pressures, with the koa tree symbolizing the warrior spirit that was later suppressed.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This chapter weaves together themes of lineage, spiritual significance, and the sacred connection between humans and nature in Hawaiian culture. Central to the narrative is the genealogy of key figures such as Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Pōka‘ī, Kauluakaha‘i, and Puali‘i, emphasizing their roles as ancestors and their ties to specific lands like Ewa, Honouliuli, and Keahumoa. The text highlights the reverence for taro (‘au ‘uala) and the ocean, portrayed as life-giving forces intertwined with human existence, as seen in Puali‘i’s ritual of catching fish for taro and the metaphorical naming of places after familial and natural elements.  

Culturally, the chapter reflects the importance of ali‘i (noble chiefs) and their responsibilities, including leadership in rituals, warfare, and agricultural practices. The burning of coconut leaves and the use of sacred objects like ko‘ilipi underscore the spiritual ceremonies and offerings to ancestors. Conflicts between figures, such as the confrontation between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and ‘Ama‘u, illustrate power struggles and the consequences of hubris, while the emphasis on stillness (kū maila) and refuge in the ocean points to the value of harmony with nature and the afterlife.  

Historically, the text preserves ancestral stories and land divisions, linking individuals to specific regions and their sacredness. The repeated references to ""five miles"" (depth or distance) symbolize profound or vast significance, reinforcing the mythic scale of the events. The synthesis of passages reveals a narrative about the interplay of human agency and divine will, where prayers, rituals, and natural elements guide the actions of characters. The chapter’s significance in Hawaiian literature lies in its preservation of cultural values, such as the sanctity of taro as a symbol of kinship, the role of chiefs as intermediaries between the physical and spiritual worlds, and the enduring legacy of ancestral stories through oral tradition. Together, these elements form a cohesive tale of creation, conflict, and connection, reflecting the deep interdependence of Hawaiian people with their environment and the divine."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Then Pōka‘ī was born to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, then Kauluakaha‘i was born in that land, because Pōka‘ī and his wife, and afterwards, was born. In this birth, there was a great child of Pōka‘ī and his child of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","• **Allegorical interpretation of the land and lineage**  
  – The phrase “O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina” (Hō‘ae‘ae of Ewa is the land) suggests a symbolic connection to the district of Ewa (a region on O‘ahu) as a place of origin or spiritual foundation. “Hō‘ae‘ae” (eternal, unending) may represent the cyclical nature of Hawaiian cosmology, where land and lineage are tied to the divine.  
  – The naming of “Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (Sea’s Fullness or Moon’s Abundance) could allegorically signify the union of celestial forces (sea and moon) as creators of life, reflecting the Hawaiian belief in the sacredness of natural elements as ancestors.  

• **Symbolism of names and their etymology**  
  – **Pōka‘ī**: “Pō” (night, realm of the dead) + “ka‘ī” (to be born, to emerge). Allegorically, this may represent the birth of a new era from the “night” of the old kapu system, symbolizing transition or renewal.  
  – **Kauluakaha‘i**: “Kau” (to be strong, endure) + “lu” (to be, to exist) + “kaha‘i” (to be born). This could symbolize resilience or the enduring strength of the people, reflecting post-contact struggles to maintain cultural identity.  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: “Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o” (the sea’s fullness, the moon’s abundance). “Nāmaka” (sea) and “pāo‘o” (abundance, completion) may allude to the ocean as a source of life and the moon as a symbol of time and fertility, linking the narrative to traditional cosmology.  

• **Historical and cultural context: Transition from ‘Ai Kapu to Missionary Influence**  
  – The passage may allude to the collapse of the ‘Ai Kapu (sacred laws) in 1819, when Kamehameha II abolished the kapu system, marking a shift from ritualistic to secular governance. The “night” (Pō) and “moon” (‘ula) could symbolize the old religious order, while the “sea” (Nāmaka) represents the people’s connection to the ocean.  
  – The mention of “hānau” (birth) and lineage might critique the erosion of traditional genealogical ties during the missionary period (post-1820), as foreign influences disrupted indigenous knowledge systems.  
  – “Kauluakaha‘i” (Born of Strength) could reflect the struggle to preserve cultural identity amid colonialism, with “kau” (endure) symbolizing the resilience of Hawaiian values.  

• **Numerical symbolism and riddles**  
  – The repetition of “kāna keiki” (his child) and the structure of the names may hint at genealogical continuity, emphasizing the importance of lineage in Hawaiian society.  
  – The phrase “ma kēia hānau ‘ana” (in this birth) could imply a metaphorical rebirth of the people, aligning with the 1819 abolition of ‘Ai Kapu as a symbolic “death” of the old order and “birth” of a new one.  

• **Social commentary and critique**  
  – The narrative may critique the disruption of traditional social structures by colonial forces, as the “sea and moon” (Nāmakaokapāo‘o) as ancestors contrast with the post-contact era’s secularization.  
  – The name “Pōka‘ī” (Born of the Night) could symbolize the lingering influence of old religious practices, while “Kauluakaha‘i” (Born of Strength) reflects the need for adaptation.  
  – The ambiguity of “ho‘i akula” (then again) might signify the cyclical nature of Hawaiian history, where past and future intertwine, but also the tension between tradition and change.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

He goes to Pōka‘ī and asks him, he says to him: ""I ask you for a wife."" Pōka‘ī replies: ""How do you ask for me? I have children, and my husband is [something]."" Puali‘i replies: ""These things are not those things. You ask me, let us sleep."" Pōka‘ī says ""Yes."" Then Pōka‘ī returns with his husband and Puali‘i to the garden of Keahumoa, resides.","• The narrative reflects a tension between traditional Hawaiian social structures and the transformative impact of colonialism, symbolizing the disruption of kapu (sacred laws) and the erosion of indigenous governance.  
  – The ""Ai Kapu"" era (pre-1819) emphasized strict social hierarchies and restrictions, particularly around marriage and resource access. The abolition of the kapu system in 1819 by Kamehameha II marked a turning point, allowing for intermarriage across classes and challenging ancestral norms.  
  – Pōka‘ī’s refusal to comply with Puali‘i’s request for a wife underscores resistance to external pressures, such as missionary influence or foreign ideologies, which sought to restructure Hawaiian society.  

• Analysis of names and symbolism:  
  – **Puali‘i**: ""Pau"" (end, completion) + ""li‘i"" (rest, calm). Allegorically, this name could represent a leader or figure seeking resolution or stability, possibly mirroring the quest for peace after the kapu system’s collapse.  
  – **Pōka‘ī**: ""Pō"" (night, darkness) + ""ka‘ī"" (edge, boundary). Suggests a guardian of thresholds or a mediator between realms, reflecting the role of ali‘i (noble class) in maintaining social order.  
  – **Keahumoa**: ""Kea"" (white, pure) + ""humoa"" (to rest, to be at ease). Symbolizes a sacred space of tranquility, possibly representing the pre-contact ideal of a harmonious society or a metaphor for the ""garden"" of cultural traditions under threat.  

• Historical and cultural context:  
  – The reference to Pōka‘ī’s ""kāne"" (husband) and ""ke keiki"" (children) highlights the pre-contact emphasis on family as the core social unit, where lineage and kapu governed relationships. Post-1819, with the abolition of the kapu system, such structures were destabilized, leading to shifts in social dynamics.  
  – The phrase ""He mea ‘ole ia mau mea"" (""These things are not those things"") echoes the post-1819 era’s rejection of old norms, symbolizing the irreconcilable differences between traditional and colonial values. Missionary influence after 1820 further eroded indigenous practices, as seen in the narrative’s critique of social reordering.  

• Numerical symbolism and riddles:  
  – The absence of explicit numbers may reflect the importance of ""kāne"" (husband) as a symbolic figure, representing the patriarchal structure of Hawaiian society. The ""ke keiki"" (children) could signify the continuity of family and land, a central value in pre-contact Hawaii.  

• Social commentary:  
  – The dialogue critiques the imposition of foreign values on Hawaiian society, with Pōka‘ī’s refusal to ""makemake"" (ask) for a wife symbolizing resistance to forced assimilation. The phrase ""e moe kāua"" (""let us sleep"") may allegorically represent the need for rest or reflection amid upheaval, contrasting with the chaos of colonial disruption.  
  – The return to ""ke kula o Keahumoa"" (the garden of Keahumoa) could symbolize a longing to reclaim ancestral lands or traditions, yet the narrative’s abrupt ending suggests unresolved tension between past and present.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

And the taro spoke, the words of Puali‘i in his own tongue: “Here is the head of the ulua (eel) and the taro, and Puali‘i's food, and then, free, his wife's food, Pōka‘ī and other things.” Thus, Puali‘i went to the sea of Honouliuli and caught fish for the taro.","• The passage reflects a transition from traditional Hawaiian agricultural and spiritual practices to post-contact social changes  
  – The mention of taro (kalo) fields and rituals ties to the sacred kalo cultivation system, central to Hawaiian subsistence and cosmology (Kamehameha’s conquest and the ‘Ai Kapu era, 1819).  
  – The name “Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o” (The Eyes of the Chief) symbolizes the hierarchical relationship between land, resources, and leadership, with the taro fields as both physical and spiritual entities.  

• Symbolism of “kālua” (eel) and “kalo” (taro) as dual sacred symbols  
  – “Kālua” (ulua) represents Kanaloa, the god of the ocean and fertility, while “kalo” is the sacred ancestor of the Hawaiian people (Malo, 1951).  
  – The dialogue attributed to the taro (“Here is the head of the ulua and the taro”) may allegorically signify the unity of land and sea in Hawaiian cosmology, where kalo (land) and ulua (sea) are intertwined in resource management.  

• Etymology and allegorical meanings of names  
  – **Puali‘i**: “Pau” (to finish, conclude) + “li‘i” (to be, to exist). Symbolizes a leader who brings closure to a system or establishes a new order.  
  – **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o**: “Nā” (the), “maka” (eyes), “o” (of), “ka-pāo‘o” (chief, from *pā‘o*—to rule, to lead). Represents the “Eyes of the Chief,” suggesting the fields as sacred extensions of the ali‘i (chief) who oversees them.  
  – **Pōka‘ī**: A name possibly linked to “pō” (night, darkness) and “kā‘ī” (to scatter, to distribute). May symbolize the redistribution of resources or the cyclical nature of life and death.  

• Historical context: Post-1820 missionary influence and the collapse of ‘Ai Kapu  
  – The “Ai Kapu” (food taboo) system, abolished in 1819, governed resource access and social hierarchy. The phrase “noa” (free) in the dialogue may allude to the post-1819 reforms, which dismantled kapu restrictions, enabling commoners to eat taro freely.  
  – The reference to Puali‘i’s actions—fishing for taro—could critique the disruption of traditional agricultural practices by post-contact economic shifts, such as commercial fishing or missionary-driven land reforms.  

• Numerical symbolism and the role of “elua” (two)  
  – “Elua āna mau māla ‘uala lō‘ihi” (two of the taro fields of Lō‘ihi) may signify duality in Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., male/female, land/sea), but also the fragmentation of land after Western contact.  
  – The number “two” could also allude to the twin gods of the Mo‘ohala (the twin deities of the sea and land), reflecting the tension between traditional resource stewardship and colonial exploitation.  

• Social commentary on gender and resource distribution  
  – The mention of Puali‘i’s wife and “Pōka‘ī” may hint at shifting gender roles under missionary influence, where female leadership in agriculture was diminished.  
  – The phrase “‘ai kāna wahine, Pōka‘ī a me nā mea ‘ē a‘e” (his wife’s food, Pōka‘ī and other things) could allegorically represent the marginalization of women’s roles in post-contact society, contrasting with pre-contact matriarchal systems.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

They arrived at the taro fields, as they were with the children, “Stop the pu‘e with all the taro leaves on top, leave none to grow.” Therefore, only the children, then, only the small and quiet in the taro, no stop in the pu‘e.","• [Allegorical interpretation of the narrative as a reflection of resource management and spiritual discipline]  
  – The story of Puli‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o navigating taro fields (‘uala) symbolizes the tension between human activity and natural stewardship in traditional Hawaiian society. The ""pu‘e"" (possibly a sacred site or agricultural practice) represents the sacredness of land and its resources, while the command to ""stop the pu‘e with all the taro leaves on top"" mirrors the 'Ai Kapu' system’s restrictions on harvesting, emphasizing balance and reverence for the environment.  
  – The phrase ""e lewalewa ana nō"" (only to continue) suggests a cycle of labor and spiritual obligation, reflecting the kapu’s role in enforcing social and ecological order.  

• [Analysis of character names and symbolism]  
  – **Puli‘i**: ""Puli"" (to break or to stop) + ""‘i"" (suffix indicating possession or origin). Symbolizes a guardian of boundaries or a figure enforcing sacred laws.  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (the child of the pāo‘o of the sea). ""Nāmaka"" (sea) and ""pāo‘o"" (a type of fish or a term for a sacred object) suggest a connection to the ocean and its spiritual significance, possibly representing the interplay between land and sea in Hawaiian cosmology.  
  – **Pu‘e**: A term for a sacred or ritual site, often linked to agricultural practices like taro cultivation, which was central to Hawaiian identity and cosmology.  

• [Historical and cultural context: 'Ai Kapu era and post-1819 transitions]  
  – The narrative reflects the 'Ai Kapu' (food taboo) system, where specific resources were protected by sacred laws. The ""small mistake"" (hapa kona ki‘eki‘e) might allegorize the consequences of violating these taboos, which were strictly enforced before Kamehameha I’s 1819 abolition of kapu.  
  – The phrase ""kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala"" (only the small and quiet in the taro) could critique the marginalization of children or marginalized groups under rigid social structures, a theme that gained prominence after missionary contact (post-1820) as traditional hierarchies were challenged.  

• [Numerical symbolism and riddles]  
  – The term ""‘elua"" (two) may symbolize duality in Hawaiian cosmology, such as the balance between land and sea or the two realms of life (mortal and divine). The ""two-fold with his small mistake"" might hint at the dual burden of responsibility and error, a common motif in Hawaiian narratives.  
  – The repetition of ""no laila"" (then) and ""kāohi mālie"" (small and quiet) underscores the inevitability of consequences, aligning with the Hawaiian concept of *kū* (to stand firm) in the face of divine or social laws.  

• [Social commentary and critique]  
  – The story critiques the rigidity of pre-contact kapu systems, where even minor transgressions (like ""ki‘eki‘e,"" small mistakes) carried severe penalties, reflecting the era’s strict social control.  
  – The mention of children (""keiki"") as the focus of the narrative highlights their role as inheritors of tradition, a theme later challenged by missionary influence, which emphasized education and individualism over communal rituals.  
  – The phrase ""e lewalewa ana nō"" (only to continue) may allegorize the persistence of traditional practices despite external pressures, symbolizing the resilience of *mo‘olelo* (history) in the face of colonialism.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

And then, he again went to the fire, burning eight coconut leaves on top of the fire, placed upon it. For it, they are burned on the fire, and again, his father, the elder, descended, and he approached his mother, to Pōka‘ī: “Not.” Puali‘i replied: “Yes, the darkness of the thing to be burned is my coconut tree on this day, for thus, on this day, he will be made.""","• [Allegorical interpretation of the passage: Rituals as a metaphor for cultural transformation]  
  – The act of ""making a single coconut tree on top of another"" symbolizes the construction of social hierarchies or the blending of traditions during the 'Ai Kapu era (sacred kapu system). Coconut trees (‘uala) represent sustenance and spiritual connection, while their stacking suggests the interdependence of human and divine realms.  
  – The ""eight coconut leaves"" (ehā ‘au o ka ‘uala) may allegorically reflect the eight directions of the universe (mo‘olele) in Hawaiian cosmology, a sacred number tied to navigation and spiritual balance (Kamakau, 1992). Burning them on a fire (ahi) could signify purification or the dissolution of old structures.  

• [Symbolism of names: Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Pōka‘ī, Puali‘i]  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: Etymologically, ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (the one who seeks the sea’s creation). ""Maka"" (sea) and ""pāo‘o"" (to create or build) suggest a connection to the ocean’s life-giving power, possibly representing the *mo‘o* (guardian spirits) of the sea or navigators.  
  – **Pōka‘ī**: ""Pō-ka-‘ī"" (night’s eye or darkness of the eye). ""Pō"" (night) and ""ka‘ī"" (eye) may allude to the *mo‘o* (guardian of the night) or the hidden knowledge of the ancestors, contrasting with the ""light"" of new practices post-1820.  
  – **Puali‘i**: ""Pua-li‘i"" (flower of the li‘i plant). ""Pua"" (flower) and ""li‘i"" (a type of sacred plant) symbolize fragility and sacredness, possibly reflecting the tension between traditional rituals and the encroaching influence of missionaries.  

• [Historical context: 'Ai Kapu to post-1820 reforms]  
  – The ""fire"" (ahi) and ""burning"" (‘ōhinu) may reference the *kūpaoa* (sacred fires) used in *kapu* rituals, which were abolished in 1819 after Kamehameha’s death. The act of burning ""eight coconut leaves"" could parallel the dismantling of kapu systems, where rituals were replaced by Christian practices.  
  – The dialogue between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i mirrors the conflict between traditionalists (""‘A‘ole"") and those embracing Western influence (""‘Ae""). This reflects the post-1820 period’s social upheaval, as missionaries introduced new values, disrupting ancestral practices (Green, 1992).  

• [Numerical symbolism: Eight as a sacred number]  
  – The number ""eight"" (ehā) in Hawaiian culture represents the *mo‘olele* (directions) and the *kūmūho‘ā* (eight elements of the natural world), symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and the cosmos. The burning of eight leaves may allegorically signify the surrender of these elements to a new order, reflecting the loss of traditional knowledge.  
  – The phrase ""the size of the two coconut trees is a measure"" (he kanahā āhua ka nui o nā māla ‘elua) could allude to the binary cosmology of *Māui* (the god of fishing and navigation) and *Hina* (the moon goddess), representing the duality of life and death, or the old and new worlds.  

• [Cultural critique: The erosion of sacred practices]  
  – The narrative critiques the erosion of *kapu* (sacred laws) through the metaphor of burning sacred objects (coconut leaves). The ""mother"" (makuahine) and ""father"" (makua kāne) may symbolize the dual forces of tradition and change, with the father’s action (descending to the fire) representing the collapse of ancestral authority.  
  – The line ""on this day, he will be made"" (eia kona lā e make ai ia‘u) reflects the inevitability of cultural transformation, a theme tied to the post-1820 missionary influence that redefined Hawaiian identity and spirituality.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

The children all knew, and they were still at the lō‘ihi (place of stillness) for the sake of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Behold! This ko‘ilipi is in my hand, a thing of the night, and of the night, and then, a kālua (game of chance) and taro, and I will eat first, and then, it is done.” There was no one else with Nāmakaokapāo‘o in these words, and then Puali‘i spoke new words: “The sea of my sacred place, lo! The Great Chief of the Clouds, my sacred place is this, the Great Chief of Hawai‘i, lo! The one who is still, the one who is still, the people and the forest, the forest and the pig, it is only with Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”","• The passage reflects a tension between traditional Hawaiian cosmology and post-contact colonial influences  
  – The reference to ""ko‘ilipi"" (possibly a type of fish or metaphor for the kapu system) and ""‘au ‘uala"" (taro, a sacred staple crop) symbolizes the clash between indigenous practices and introduced Western systems  
  – ""Kū maila ma kahi lō‘ihi"" (stillness in a place of stillness) alludes to the 1819 abolition of the kapu system by Kamehameha II, marking the end of traditional social structures  

• Analysis of character names and symbolism  
  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (Sea of the Chief of the Clouds) – ""Nā"" (plural), ""maka"" (eyes, or ""to gaze at""), ""o"" (possessive), ""ka-pāo‘o"" (clouds). Symbolizes the sacredness of the ocean and celestial realms, tied to the god Kanaloa.  
  – **Puali‘i**: ""Pua-li‘i"" (flower of the line/legacy) – ""Pua"" (flower) + ""li‘i"" (lineage). Represents the transition to a new era, possibly a Christian convert or a figure embracing Western values.  
  – **Kukui‘aimakaokalani**: ""Kukui-o-ka-maka-o-ka-lani"" (Cloud of the Chief of the Sky). ""Kukui"" (cloud, also a sacred fire) + ""lani"" (sky/royalty). Reflects the fusion of natural elements with divine authority, a motif in pre-contact cosmology.  

• Historical and cultural context  
  – The ""Ai Kapu era"" (1819) marks the collapse of the kapu system, leading to the introduction of Christian practices and the suppression of traditional rituals. This is mirrored in Puali‘i’s ""new words"" (‘ōlelo hou), symbolizing missionary influence.  
  – ""Kālua me ka ‘uala"" (game of chance with taro) references the pre-contact practice of ""kālua"" (dice games) and taro as a sacred resource, highlighting the erosion of indigenous knowledge systems.  
  – The phrase ""Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" (only with Nāmakaokapāo‘o) critiques the marginalization of traditional leaders during the post-contact period, as seen in the 1820s when missionaries sought to replace ali‘i with Western governance.  

• Numerical symbolism and riddles  
  – ""E hāpāpa‘a mai nei"" (three times) and ""e ‘ai paha, e waiho paha"" (two times) reflect the Hawaiian concept of *kupono* (balance) and the tripartite division of the cosmos (land, sea, sky). The repetition of ""e"" (three) and ""e"" (two) may encode a ritual formula for offerings or oaths.  
  – ""Kālua me ka ‘uala"" (game and taro) could allude to the *mo‘olelo* (myth) of the *kālua* (dice) as a metaphor for fate, while taro represents the *kāne* (male) and *wahine* (female) dualities in Hawaiian cosmology.  

• Social commentary on cultural transition  
  – The dialogue between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o critiques the imposition of Western values on Hawaiian identity. Puali‘i’s ""new words"" (‘ōlelo hou) symbolize the missionaries’ efforts to replace indigenous language and practices, as documented in Kamakau’s *Rituals of the Hawaiian People* (1992).  
  – The phrase ""kū maila ma kahi lō‘ihi"" (stillness in a place of stillness) underscores the loss of *ʻāina* (land) as a living entity, a concept central to Hawaiian *mo‘okūauhau* (genealogy) and ecological knowledge.  
  – The repetition of ""e he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale"" (let it be, let it be still) echoes the *kīlauea* (volcanic) metaphor for transformation, reflecting the upheaval of the Contact Period.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","In this place, they speak in a small way about these two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, who are two great ali‘i (noble chiefs) of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani is the male parent, and Nāmakaokai‘a is the child. Thus, they entered into the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","• [Allegorical interpretation of the passage as a metaphor for spiritual and social transitions]  
  – The text reflects the tension between traditional Hawaiian religious practices (‘Ai Kapu) and the cultural shifts following the 1819 abolition of the ‘Ai Kapu system, which dismantled the old kapu (sacred laws) and marked the collapse of the kapu system.  
  – The phrase “entered into the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o” may symbolize the integration of ancestral spiritual practices into a new paradigm, possibly hinting at the erosion of indigenous cosmology under missionary influence.  

• [Symbolism of the names: Nāmakaokalani, Nāmakaokai‘a, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o]  
  – Nā-maka-o-kalani: “Nāmaka” (sea/waves) + “o” (possessive) + “kalani” (king, chief). Etymologically, this could mean “the sea’s chief” or “the one who rules the ocean,” symbolizing control over natural forces.  
  – Nā-maka-o-kai‘a: “Nāmaka” (sea) + “o” (possessive) + “kai‘a” (a name, possibly “kai” as “sea” and “‘a” as a suffix denoting “to flow” or “to move”). This might represent “the sea’s flow” or “the ocean’s movement,” linking to the cyclical nature of Hawaiian life and the importance of water in rituals.  
  – Nā-maka-o-kapāo‘o: “Nāmaka” (sea) + “o” (possessive) + “kapāo‘o” (a name, possibly derived from “pāo‘o” [to cover/protect] or “kapāo‘o” [a place of protection]). This could signify “the sea’s protector” or “the sacred ocean’s veil,” representing the divine or ancestral connection to the ocean.  

• [Historical context: Transition from ‘Ai Kapu to missionary influence]  
  – The mention of ali‘i (noble chiefs) and their roles as parents/children aligns with the pre-contact hierarchy, where ali‘i were central to both political and spiritual authority. The ‘Ai Kapu system (1819) enforced strict separation of social classes and dietary restrictions, and its abolition by Kamehameha II marked a turning point in Hawaiian society.  
  – The term “pule” (prayer) here likely refers to traditional spiritual practices, contrasting with the post-1820 Christian prayers introduced by missionaries. The passage may subtly critique the loss of indigenous spiritual frameworks, as the “prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o” could symbolize the fading of old rituals.  
  – The repetition of “Nāmaka” (sea) in the names may allegorically represent the vastness of the ocean as a metaphor for the interconnectedness of life, a concept central to Hawaiian cosmology, while the suffix “-kalani” (chief) and “-kai‘a” (child) could reflect generational cycles of leadership and spiritual responsibility.  

• [Numerical symbolism and riddles in the text]  
  – The use of “mā ‘ane‘i” (in this place) and “mā lāua” (two of them) may allude to the dualities in Hawaiian philosophy, such as the balance between land and sea, or the spiritual and physical realms.  
  – The structure of the sentence—listing two names, their parent-child relationship, and their entry into a prayer—mirrors the traditional Hawaiian narrative style that encodes knowledge through repetition and symbolic layers, often used in mele (chants) to preserve history.  

• [Cultural critique and social commentary]  
  – The passage may critique the disruption of traditional lineage and spiritual practices, as the parent-child dynamic (Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a) is tied to the “prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o,” suggesting a loss of ancestral authority.  
  – The term “kane” (male) and “keiki” (child) could highlight the gendered roles in pre-contact society, where ali‘i were both political and spiritual leaders. The narrative’s brevity might reflect the oral transmission of knowledge, which was later marginalized by written Christian records.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

At that time, they were searching for Puali‘i in the ko‘ilipi on the side of Nāmakapāo‘o. They turned to the chief of Puali‘i, the chief's place, and spoke from another place. The chief of Puali‘i came to Nāmakapāo‘o: 'Aloha to you, O Nāmakapāo‘o.' Nāmakapāo‘o also went to the chief of Puali‘i and sailed to the sea of Waipouli, he was in the area of Honouliuli, his loa, five miles the loa.","• The passage reflects the collapse of the traditional Hawaiian kapu system and the emergence of new religious and social paradigms post-1819.  
  – The completion of the ""pule"" (prayer/ritual) symbolizes the end of the 'Ai Kapu era, a period of strict religious restrictions that were abolished in 1819 after Kamehameha II’s death.  
  – The act of ""ho‘ohuli aku"" (turning to) the chief of Puali‘i suggests a shift from spiritual to political authority, aligning with the post-1819 power struggles and the rise of new leadership structures.  

• The name ""Nāmakapāo‘o"" carries layered symbolism:  
  – ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (The Eye of the Pāo‘o): ""Maka"" (eye) could imply spiritual vision or perception, while ""pāo‘o"" (a name or place) might reference a sacred site or ancestral lineage.  
  – ""Pāo‘o"" may derive from ""pā‘o"" (to be complete or fulfilled), suggesting a narrative of culmination or transformation.  

• The ""loa"" (canoe) and ""five miles"" (‘elima mile) symbolize a journey or transition, possibly mirroring the cultural shift from traditional practices to Western influences.  
  – ""Loa"" as a canoe could represent the physical and metaphorical movement between worlds—traditional (mo‘olelo) and colonial (Christianity).  
  – The number ""five"" (‘elima) may allude to the five elements of the natural world (kupua, mo‘olelo, etc.), reflecting a cosmological framework.  

• The dialogue ""Aloha ‘oe"" (Greetings to you) underscores the tension between indigenous values and missionary-imposed norms.  
  – ""Aloha"" as a term of respect and connection contrasts with the later suppression of traditional practices under missionary influence.  
  – The phrase ""e Nāmakapāo‘o"" highlights the hierarchical structure of Hawaiian society, where names denote status and lineage.  

• The reference to ""kai o Waipouli"" (sea of Waipouli) and ""kahakai o Honouliuli"" (area of Honouliuli) situates the narrative in specific geographical and cultural contexts.  
  – Waipouli and Honouliuli are locations tied to historical events, such as the 1819 abolition of the kapu system, which was a pivotal moment in Hawaiian history.  
  – The act of sailing (""kiola akula"") to these places may allegorically represent the movement from a sacred to a secular realm, as the mission era introduced new ideologies.  

• The narrative critiques the disruption of traditional knowledge systems by external forces.  
  – The ""ko‘ilipi"" (ritual space) and ""pule"" (prayer) symbolize the old religion, while the ""po‘o"" (chief) and ""‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē"" (speaking from another place) reflect the imposition of foreign languages and governance.  
  – The fragmentation of the ""loa"" (canoe) into ""five miles"" may allegorically depict the disintegration of cultural unity under colonial pressures.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me.
