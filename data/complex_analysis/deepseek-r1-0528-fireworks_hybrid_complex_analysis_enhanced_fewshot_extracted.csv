Pōka'ī was the mother. His father was a great chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he also had divine ancestry.""","**Paragraph 1 Commentary:**
• The narrative follows classic Hawaiian storytelling conventions by establishing three core elements immediately:
  - **a) Protagonist Description:** Opens with the main character (**Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** - ""The-Eyes-of-the-pāo'o-fish"") framed through physical attributes: extreme smallness ('u'uku loa) combined with extraordinary strength (ikaika loa) in infancy ('ōpiopio). The assertion that he had ""no equal from Hawai'i to Ni'ihau"" employs hyperbole common in oral tradition to signify supreme uniqueness.
  
  – Name Etymology: Hyphenating for semantic analysis:
    - *Nā-maka* (The eyes): Often symbolizes perception/supernatural sight. 
    - *o-ka-pāo'o* (of the pāo'o fish): Pāo'o (blenny fish) signifies resilience, thriving in turbulent shorebreaks—a metaphor for overcoming adversity.
    - Combined: ""Eyes of the blenny"" suggests extraordinary perception rooted in tenacity, foreshadowing his pivotal role in society.

  – Significance of Contrast: Pairing ''u'ulu' (small) with 'koa' (bravery) reflects the Hawaiian value of compensating for weakness through inner strength (mana).

• **b1) Father Introduction:** Names the father (**Ka-ulu-a-Kaha'i** – ""The-growth/inspiration-of-Kaha'i"") immediately after the protagonist, per genealogical protocol. 
  – The name references the voyager Kaha'i who brought breadfruit to Hawai'i (cf. Pukui & Elbert 1977). 
  – Divine Connection Footnote: Later description confirms his status as ""he 'ao'ao akua"" (part-god), indicating his semi-divine descent common to ali'i nui (high chiefs).

• **c) Place of Origin:** Dual geographic anchors establish his father's foreign heritage: 
  - *Kahiki-papa-ia-lewa* (""Kahiki-stratum-hanging-in-sky""): Identifies an ancestral homeland beyond Hawai'i, with ""ia lewa"" connoting celestial realms reserved for deities/chiefs. 
  - *Kahiki-nu'u* (""Lofty-Kahiki""): A specific region within Kahiki (broad term for foreign lands), positioning him as a descendant of ancestral migrants. 

• **b2) Mother Introduction:** Briefly names the mother (**Pō-ka-'ī** – potentially ""Night-of-the-high-chief"") following matrilineal conventions.
  – Minimal Description: Contrasts with the father's elaborate titles, common when maternal lineage isn't central to sovereignty claims in this context.

• **b1 and c) Father's Status:** Reiterates the father's political-divine dual nature:
  - *He ali'i nui*: Confirms supreme chieftainship over Kahikipapaialewa.
  - *He 'ao'ao akua*: Explicitly states his divine partial ancestry. This combinaton establishes the protagonist's inherited sacred-political authority (mana ali'i) foundational to the narrative.

• **Cultural Framework:** This passage embodies ""mo'okū'auhau"" (genealogical) storytelling where:
  - Protagonist's traits foreshadow their life journey.
  - Parentage and place establish sociopolitical rank.
  - Dual human/divine ancestry validates power structures in pre-contact 'Ai Kapu society.
  – **Historical Context:** By emphasizing foreign origins (Kahiki), it invokes Hawaiian creation narratives where chiefly lines derive from ancestral voyagers, legitimizing land claims and kapu privileges under the 'Ai Kapu religious system.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This opening chapter establishes Nāmakaokapāo'o as a supernatural hero intrinsically tied to specific O'ahu locations while embedding profound cultural and historical allegories. Key temporal markers ground the narrative in pre-contact Hawai'i. The naming of the sweet potato patch ""Nāmakaokapāo'o"" at Keahumoa in Honouliuli, 'Ewa, directly references a real location known in the early 20th century, anchoring the story geographically. More critically, Puali'i's explicit declaration enforcing the 'Ai Kapu – ""When I bake the head of an ulua fish with the sweet potato and Puali'i eats, then it is free—(then) his wife, Pōka'ī, and others may eat"" – situates the narrative firmly *before* 1819. This establishes the story’s milieu as the pre-contact Kapu era and frames Puali'i as its tyrannical enforcer.

Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions explicitly dismantle this old order. His destruction of Puali'i's sweet potato gardens (""Pull up the sweet potato hills with their vines completely to the surface; don't leave any growing"") is more than vandalism; it is a symbolic razing of the agricultural and socioeconomic foundations of the Kapu system Puali'i controls. His physical confrontation with Puali'i culminates in a recited death prayer ('oli) invoking chiefly ancestors (""Nāmakaokalani... Nāmakaokaiʻa, the paramount chief of Hawaiʻi""), a traditional element of warfare, but with a supernatural turn – the axe recoiling kills Puali'i. This represents a forceful rejection and supernatural overthrow of the established Kapu authority figures. The disposal of Puali'i's head speaking the greeting ""Aloha"" offers a complex commentary on the displacement of this old order.

The narrative structure and character portrayals show distinct 19th-century influences. Pōka'ī is marginalized and voiceless – her poverty, passive acceptance of displacement (first by her divine husband, Kauluakaha'i, fleeing, then by Puali'i claiming her), and need for concealment by her son render her almost archetypically insignificant, reflecting Victorian patriarchal views imposed on Hawaiian narratives. Nāmakaokapāo'o's extreme diminutive stature juxtaposed with overwhelming strength and violence (""forty-eight men... perished... eighteen war canoes... destroying everything until nothing remained"") aligns with the archetypal ""alpha-male leader"" model prevalent in the post-1893 annexationist political literature analyzed in the reference summary. His establishment of his concealed mother as a passive ruler over O'ahu resonates more with a colonially acceptable figurehead than a truly empowered Ali'i nui.

Understanding the publication history is paramount to interpreting its significance in Hawaiian literature and potential political intent. This story first appeared in *Ka Nūpepa Kū'oko'a* in 1894 during the crucial period following the U.S. overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom (January 1893). The paper, once a bastion of nationalist Hawaiian identity, shifted support towards the occupying Provisional Government. The invented nature of the story, suggested by the absence of earlier references to Nāmakaokapāo'o or Puali'i in traditional chants or Fornander, coupled with its focus on O'ahu locations resonant at the time of publication, strongly supports its composition as a 19th-century narrative. The chapter’s core dynamic – a divinely aided, supernaturally strong, singular alpha male violently overthrowing an oppressive, Kapu-enforcing indigenous male figure (Puali'i) and then conquering rival indigenous forces ('Ama'u) – serves a potent rhetorical function within 1890s political discourse.

Therefore, this chapter functions allegorically on multiple levels. Culturally, it narrates the supernatural rejection and overthrow of the 'Ai Kapu system (""Pualiʻi enforcing the Kapu""). Politically, however, this rejection resonates powerfully in the post-1893 context. Nāmakaokapāoʻo, representing the potent force needed for radical change, eliminates obstructive indigenous systems (Kapu/Puali'i) and rivals ('Ama'u). The marginalization of women (Pōka'ī) and the establishment of passive rule aligns with Western colonial tropes. Like the analyzed summary's conclusion regarding other late-19th-century narratives, this story's introduction serves likely as an invented post-1893 pro-Western political allegory. It justifies the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom by depicting the violent removal of indigenous authority figures as necessary and divinely sanctioned liberation from oppressive systems (""Ai Kapu""), subtly promoting Western cultural models (represented by Nāmakaokapāoʻo's overwhelming power and new order) while delegitimizing traditional governance and social structures."

Pōka‘ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his homeland. Pōka‘ī remained with her pregnancy, and in time gave birth. At this birthing, Pōka‘ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were deeply impoverished.","**Paragraph 2:**
• This segment establishes critical foundational elements of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s origin story, focusing on **a)** geographic setting; **b)** conception and birth circumstances; **c)** departure of the father; and **d)** socioeconomic conditions at birth. These motifs follow Hawaiian narrative conventions where birth origins foreshadow a hero’s destiny.

**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Place Name Symbolism:**
   – *Hō‘ae‘ae* (broken grass/reeds): A site in ‘*Ewa* (lit., ""*stray vapor*""), O'ahu’s western district renowned for fishponds and fertility. Hō‘ae‘ae appears in chants as a liminal space—its name evokes physical/spiritual struggle (e.g., cutting grass symbolizes clearing obstacles). Its mention roots the hero’s conception in a liminal zone between desert (‘*Ewa*’s inland areas) and ocean (the ‘*Ewa* coast).
   – ‘*Ewa* as *piko* (navel): Historically a migration route for spirits (*ʻ*Umi-a-Līloa’s legends describe ‘*Ewa* as a threshold between realms). This aligns with Kauluakaha‘i returning to his ""’*āina*"" (land)—a foreign/distance place metaphorizing ancestral realms.

2. **Conception Ritual Lexicon:**
   – *Launa kino* (physical intimacy): Beyond literal union, this phrase invokes *ho‘olauna* (to establish spiritual kinship). Hawaiian cosmology regarded conception (*loa‘a*) as divine orchestration, especially given Kauluakaha‘i’s semidivine status (from **Example 1**).
   – Temporal marker ""*ā loa‘a*"" (until obtained): Emphasizes conception as *destiny fulfilled*. Pōka‘ī’s pregnancy (*hāpai*) becomes an isolated burden after Kauluakaha‘i’s departure—per archetypal ""abandoned mother"" tropes in *oli* (chants) like those of Hāloa.

3. **Socioeconomic Symbolism:**
   – *‘Ililihune* (destitution): Sharpens the paradox of divine lineage born in poverty. In the ‘*Ai Kapu* era, chiefs (*ali‘i*) embodied wealth (*waiwai*). ‘*Ililihune* is thus allegorical: 
     – Represents *haumia* (ritual impurity) from unattended birth.
     – Foreshadows Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s role as a disruptor of stratified norms (echoing **Example 3**’s dismantling of ‘*Ai Kapu*).
   – Postpartum isolation critique: Pōka‘ī’s lack of resources subtly critiques breaches of *kuleana* (responsibility); fathers were obligated to provide for pregnant partners under *kanawai* (pre-contact law).

4. **Ancestral Departure Motif:**
   – Kauluakaha‘i’s return to his *‘āina* (Kahikipapaialewa, per **Example 1**) mirrors god-patterns like *Wākea’s* cyclical departures. This establishes:
     – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a *fatherless hero* destined to quest for lineage restoration.
     – Maternal resilience: Pōka‘ī’s solitary endurance (""*noho ihola*"") becomes her *kuleana*.

5. **Name Etymology Revisited:**
   – *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (Eyes of the *pāo‘o* fish):
     – *Pāo‘o* (darter/fugitive fish: *Blenniidae*) symbolizes resourcefulness in desolation, mirroring the birth setting. Its tidal habitat at ‘Ewa reef underscores ""adaptation"" as the hero’s trait.
     – *Maka* (eyes) references future sight/intuition—critical given the poverty context, where vision (*‘ike*) triumphs over visible lack.

6. **Chrono-Symbolism in Verbs:**
   – Sequence of *hāpai* → *noho* (to stay, endure) → *hānau* builds tension toward rebirth themes. Hawaiian birth chants (*oli pōpolo*) often juxtapose desolation with potential.
   – *Ho‘i akula* contrasts with *noho ihola*: Kauluakaha‘i’s departure is swift, irrevocable (""*akula*""), while Pōka‘ī’s endurance is ongoing (""*ihola*"").

7. **Cultural Paradigms:**
   – ‘*Ai Kapu* implications: Sexual union (*launa kino*) required chiefly alignment. Kauluakaha‘i’s withdrawal violated *ho‘omana* (spiritual obligations) potentially precipitating *‘ilihune* (discordant natural order).
   – *Kahiko* (ancient) precedent: Similar narratives (e.g., *Māui*’s abandonment by *Irawaru*) emphasize that heroes emerge from disrupted *pono* (balance).

**Allegorical Subtext:**  
The geographic and social desolation frames Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a *kupua* (shape-shifting hero) birthed during *pō* (chaos). His origin in ‘*Ewa*—a territory of *literal* strays—signifies a journey to restore familial/cosmic alignment by transcending physical and metaphorical *‘ilihune*.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

He was a good man on his way to fish in the coastal waters of Honouliuli. He stopped at Pōka'ī's house, looked at her, and desired her. He declared, ""I want you as my wife."" Pōka'ī responded, ""How could you possibly desire me? I've given birth to a child, and my body is ruined."" Puali'i replied, ""Those things mean nothing. If you desire me, let us sleep together."" Pōka'ī agreed. Then Pōka'ī left with her husband Puali'i and settled on the plains of Keahumoa.","**Paragraph 3:** (Note: Following the sequential context, this is Chapter 1, Paragraph 3)
• Introduces a new character: Pua-(a)li'i (Child/Blossom-of-Chiefs), described as **a)** a ""good man"" (kanaka maika'i), establishing his virtuous nature; **b)** connected to Līhu'e (originally dry or cold place), suggesting regional identity or provenance; **c)** framed as traveler engaged in fishing (lawaiʻa), grounding his introduction in occupational context common to Hawaiian moʻolelo narrative structure.  
– Name etymological breakdown: ""Pua""=child/progeny/blossom + ""liʻi""=vocalic form of ""aliʻi"" (chiefly rank), indicating his chiefly lineage. Reflects characteristic Hawaiian practice of encoding status in personal nomenclature.  
– Cultural mobility context: Pua-li'i's journey from Līhu'e (identified as central Oʻahu according to Fornander and Pukui) to coastal Honouliuli exemplifies pre-contact travel practices during the 'Ai Kapu period, where:  
  – Coastal resource gathering (fishing) motivated inland-to-coast mobility  
  – Travelers routinely visited households along travel routes per sacred hospitality customs (kīpuka kānāwai)  
• Chronicles pivotal relational negotiation with layered cultural significance:  
  – Pua-li'i's direct marriage proposal (""Makemake au iā 'oe i wahine na'u"") reflects traditional courtship protocols, where chiefs often asserted desire first  
  – Pōka'ī's self-deprecating objection (""Ua 'ino'ino ko'u kino"") reveals post-partum body perceptions tied to   
    > Childbirth trauma stigma (cf. Pukui's ""Nānā i ke Kumu"")  
    > Gendered valuation of physical ""perfection"" in chiefly coupling traditions  
  – Pua-li'i's counterargument (""He mea 'ole ia"") transcends physical concerns to prioritize mutual consent (""Ke makemake 'oe ia'u""), prioritizing emotional resonance over biological functionality  
• Transactional-sexual contract (""e moe kāua"") serves as relational catalyst, triggering:  
  – Relocation to Ke-a-hu-moa (The-chicken-heap) showing patrilocal resettlement pattern  
  – Pōka'ī's redefinition as ""kāna kāne"" (his man/husband) confirms immediate spousal reorientation  
– Allegorical dynamics: Represents:  
  > Metaphysical restoration: Pōka'ī's ""ruined"" body redemption through desire  
  > Socio-political navigation: Cross-regional bonding (Līhu'e → 'Ewa via Puali'i/Pōka'ī interface)  
• Geospatial anchors reflect Oʻahu-centric worldview:  
  – Honouliuli (Dark/dusky-bay) as 'Ewa district fishing ground in 'Ai Kapu-era resource geography  
  – Keahumoa as Līhu'e agro-pastoral zone, symbolic of regeneration cycles (chicken=egg fertility)  
• Textual foreshadowing: Pōka'ī's passive-agency relocation prefigures subsequent domestic power shifts involving her son Nāmakaokapāo'o.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

Two of his elongated sweet potato patches remain to this day, and to this day, those patches are called ""Nāmakaokapāo'o."" When the sweet potatoes matured, Puali'i declared his vow: ""When I bake the head of an ulua fish with the sweet potato and Puali'i eats, then it is free—(then) his wife, Pōka'ī, and others may eat."" Therefore, Puali'i went down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with the sweet potato.","**Paragraph 4 Analysis:**  
• **The Permanent Imprint on 'Āina (Land):**  
– The phrase ""e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā"" (remain to this day) signifies more than physical persistence; it embodies the Hawaiian concept of **kino 'āina** (land as embodiment). By attributing the name ""Nāmakaokapāo'o"" to the sweet potato patches, the land becomes an archive of personal history. This mirrors how *wahi pana* (storied places) perpetuate ancestral legacies, functionally fusing identity ('inoa) with 'āina.  
– The 'elua māla 'ua (two elongated patches) suggests sacred geometry—'2' in Hawaiian numerology often denotes balance (e.g., male/female in creation chants like Kumulipo). Their elongation ('lō'ihi') evokes ritual planting traditions for chiefly sustenance.  

• **Puali'i's 'Ōlelo Ho'ohiki (Solemn Oath):**  
– The vow establishes a strict **'Ai Kapu protocol**: Puali'i must consume the ritual meal (*kālua po'o ulua me ka 'uala*) before others can eat. This hierarchy reflects the **kapu noho** system where men purified food for gods before female consumption. The sequence:  
1. Consecration: ""*Aia ā kālua*"" (When baked—earth oven cooking sanctifies the offering)  
2. Priestly Consumption: ""*ʻai ʻo Puali‘i*"" (Puali'i eats as proxy for the gods)  
3. *Noa* Release: Spiritual restriction lifts (*noa*), allowing *Pōkaʻī to eat*.  
– The *ulua po'o* (head of ulua fish) symbolically replaces human sacrifice due to linguistic magic: *ulua* means both prize fish and ""to increase/grow"" (cf. Pukui & Elbert, 1986:369), while *po'o* (head) signified the most *mana*-charged part.  

• **Allegorical Contestation of 'Ai Kapu:**  
– The ""fish + sweet potato"" pairing inversely foreshadows the preceding passage where Puali'i *threatens* to eat Nāmakaokapāo'o's *po'o* and *maka* (symbolic equivalents). Here Puali'i insists on traditional order, while Nāmakaokapāo'o's later destruction of the crops (para.6) encodes rebellion against rigid kapu structures. This duality represents:  
– *Ka Wā Mamua* (Past): Puali'i's adherence to sacrificial protocols.  
– *Ka Wā Mahope* (Future): Nāmakaokapāo'o dismantles exploitative agriculture—the *40 mounds* in para.6 hinting at wasted abundance under kapu.  

• **Spatial Symbolism of Honouliuli:**  
– Fishing at ""*kai o Honouliuli*"" ties the ritual to specific geography. Honouliuli (Deep/Concealed Bay) in 'Ewa was a historic fishing ground layered with dual meanings:  
– Physical Abundance: Ulua thrive in murky deeps.  
– Cosmological Shadows: *Pō* (darkness) as realm of Kāne, progenitor gods. Puali'i's quest here roots his vow in primordial power dynamics.  

• **Etymological & Genealogical Resonance:**  
– ""Nāmakaokapāo'o"" is fragmented:  
* *Nā-maka-o-* (The eyes of)  
* *ka-pāo'o* [lit. the *pāo'o* fish, poetically *po'o* (head)].  
The name thus prefigures the ""head/eyes"" conflict. Puali'is journey to Kapolei (*lewa iluna*—upper sky zone) in para.6 mirrors Kauluakaha'i's celestial origin (*Kahikipapaia-lewa*—stratum in the sky) in para.1, suggesting intergenerational cosmological tension.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

The body of Nāmakaokapāo'o at that time was incredibly small; he was two-and-a-half feet tall, and his illness wasn't steady – he was still weak/dangling. When they arrived at that sweet potato garden, he commanded the children: ""Pull up the sweet potato hills with their vines completely to the surface; don't leave any growing."" However, those children were afraid, so they gently tended the sweet potatoes and did not pull up the hills.","**Paragraph 5:**
• This passage advances the adversarial relationship between Nāmakaokapāo'o and his stepfather Puali'i through agricultural sabotage, foregrounding key cultural tensions:  
   – The explicit description of Nāmakaokapāo'o's diminutive size (""he kino 'u'uku loa""), specific height measurement (""'elua kapua'i me ka hapa""), and lingering infirmity (""'a'ole i pa'a kona ma'i"") serves multiple narrative purposes. First, it emphasizes the paradox of supernatural strength within physical frailty common to Hawaiian moʻolelo heroes. Second, ""lewalewa ana nō"" evokes both physical weakness and the symbolic vulnerability of childhood (lewalewa: dangling like an unripe fruit), foreshadowing his transition to strength.

• The destructive command has layered cultural symbolism:  
   – Ordering the children to completely uproot sweet potatoes (""e huhuki i ka pu'e... ā pau loa i luna"") directly targets Puali'i's food production capabilities. In 'Ai Kapu society, agricultural sabotage threatened sociopolitical stability as demonstrated in historical accounts (e.g., conflicts over Kalo fields during inter-chieftaincy wars).  
   – Sweet potatoes ('uala) carry fertility symbolism: the tubers hidden underground represent hidden potential/knowledge, while the vines manifest surface-level appearances. Nāmakaokapāo'o's command to expose ""everything growing"" subverts traditional wisdom systems that value subtlety and layered truths.  
   – The specification ""me ka lau 'uala"" (with the leaves) reveals his intent for total annihilation, leaving no roots or vines to regrow, a rarity in traditional rotational harvesting methods.

• The children's refusal (""maka'u nō ua keiki"") reflects psychological and theological conditioning:  
   – Fear of defilement: Pulling mature crops without offering first fruits to deities might invite divine retribution, especially under a chief's land.  
   – Social repercussions: Destruction of food sources carried severe penalties including death or banishment under 'Ai Kapu laws codified in the Kumulipo creation chant cycles.  
   – ""Kāohi mālie nō ma ka 'uala"" metaphorically translates as ""they quietly restrained \[their hands] upon the sweet potatoes,"" exposing tension between obedience to authority and ingrained cultural preservation instincts.

• Numerological symbology requires unpacking:  
   – Seventeen children ('umi kumamāhiku): Composed of 10 + 7 – foundational numbers in esoteric Hawaiian knowledge. Ten ('umi) signifies divine completion (as in poepoe/life cycles), while seven references the Nā Wāhine o Kēhau/Pleiades. This group size suggests mediation between divine influences and earthly actions.  
   – Height reference (""'elua kapua'i me ka hapa""): Two-and-a-half feet corresponds to 30 inches, potentially referencing 30 moons (2.5 years) in a celestial-agricultural calendar determining planting seasons. The fractional height indicates he stands between worlds – not fully embodied in childhood or adulthood.

• Name analysis reaffirms thematic tension:  
   – Pua-li'i (discussed earlier as chiefly lineage) is reframed ""Puali'i"" without glottals, suggesting the name here represents the exploitative land tenant (li'i meaning ""swindling"" in some contexts) rather than royal bloodline (ali'i). This literary pun subverts expectations.  
   – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o reinforces ophthalmic symbolism: While ""maka"" (eyes) signifies perception, ""pāo'o"" names a blenny fish known for burrowing beneath sand to escape threats, symbolizing the hero's strategy to undermine authority structures from within.

• Allegorical interpretation positions this as anti-'Ai Kapu discourse:  
   – Destruction vs. Stewardship: Nāmakaokapāo'o's command represents revolutionary dismantling of stratified food systems, contrasted with the children's maintenance of tradition (""kāohi mālie""). This mirrors historical debates preceding the 'Ainoa system.  
   – Sickness as societal critique: His lingering illness (""ma'i"") reflects the ""dis-ease"" of 'Ai Kapu restrictions under foreign contact. His subsequent actions frame him as curative force.  
   – Numerical conflict: The threatened 40 mounds from Paragraph 3 (symbolizing Kānāwai/taboo law structure) stands to be destroyed through this act, using 17 as number of initiation. Failure to execute (via fearful children) depicts cultural stasis.  

This paragraph illuminates generational conflict through agricultural metaphor, with numerical and somatic symbolism encoding critiques of rigidity within ancestral systems.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

In that manner of pulling, both patches were finished until the mound of sweet potato leaves stood high: forty mounds total for both fields. Then Nāmakaokapāo'o returned and lit a fire to roast four bundle stems of sweet potato plants over a blazing fire pit. As he roasted them over the fire, his stepfather returned like a golden plover and arrived, asking his mother, Pōka'ī: ""No."" Puali'i answered: ""Yes, his head and eyes to be the relisher for my sweet potato this day. Therefore, this is the day for him to be killed by me.""","**Paragraph 6:**
• **Numerical Symbolism & Riddling Structure:** The quantities embedded in the destruction sequence (2 fields, 4 bundle stems, 40 mounds) follow Hawaiian *huli* (riddling) patterns. Forty (*kanahā*) suggests incompleteness (being short of the sacred number 400) and wastefulness. Four (*ehā*) symbolizes cyclicality and foundational structures, while two (*ʻelua*) represents duality – mirroring the opposing worldviews in the conflict.
  
• **Subversion of Cultivation Rituals:** The boy's actions invert standard *māla* (cultivation) protocols:
  – *Huhuki* (violent uprooting) disregards sacred harvesting protocols requiring reverence to *Lono* (god of agriculture).
  – Wilting unripe vines (*ʻau*) on a *kapuahi* (firepit) perverts the *imu* (underground oven) tradition where mature tubers are cooked for nourishment. This signals deliberate chaos creation.

• **Stepfather as Kōlea Symbol:** Calling Puali'i a *kōlea* (golden plover) metaphorizes seasonal migration patterns, implying:
  – His temporary status in Pōka'ī's life
  – Opportunistic nature (plovers steal crops in Hawaiian narratives)
  – Invasive colonial-era associations (birds introduced during Western contact)

• **Cannibalistic Threat as Meta-Commentary:** Puali'i's pronouncement uses sacred meal language in violation:
  – Threatening human head (*po'o*) and eyes (*maka*) perverts *ʻai kapu* where *ulua* fish substituted humans (Pukui & Elbert 1986:369). 
  – Wordplay connects ""maka"" to ""mata"" (taro shoot) symbolizing generational continuity – here twisted to propose termination.
  – *'Īna'i* (relish) threats invert power: Puali'i positions Nāmakaokapāo'o as inferior *i'a* (sacrificial offering).

• **Allegory of Regime Change:** The destruction sequence represents cultural schism:
  – Nāmakaokapāo'o's wastefulness embodies tearing down *kapu* systems for post-contact era liberation.
  – Opposing him, Puali'i's ""kōlea"" presence and ritual threats parallel *ali'i nui* defending stratified traditions.
  – The forty mounds and four vines symbolize *heiau* construction layers and *kuahu* (altar) symbolism, now repurposed for rebellion.

• **Name Etymology Resonance:** 
  – Nāmakaokapāo'o (""Eyes of the pāo'o fish"") gains dark irony when Puali'i targets his *maka* (eyes), weaponizing poetic namesake meaning.
  – Pua‑li'i (""Chiefly child"") name now signals corrupted authority through violent language, contrasting initial ""good man"" description.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the other children saw, ran away, and stood at a distant place out of fear for Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Hey! This razor in my hand will cut off your head today; when your head is severed, it will be baked with the sweet potatoes and I will eat first; then it will be free."" Nāmakaokapāo'o paid no attention to these words of Puali'i. Then Puali'i said it again, that second time. As Puali'i prepared to cut Nāmakaokapāo'o with the razor, Nāmakaokapāo'o recited his death prayer against Puali'i. The prayer went thus:
""Greatly beloved are the eyes of my little pāoʻo [fish],
As they shrivel and cling stubbornly,
Perhaps to consume, perhaps to leave aside,
Yet perhaps to leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,
That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,
This is my dear companion,
Nāmakaokaiʻa, the paramount chief of Hawaiʻi,
To flee, to flee while the weakling merely heaves a sigh,
For warriors had spears,
And spears had piercing tips,
They died by Nāmakaokapāoʻo.""","**Paragraph 7:**
• This passage depicts the climactic confrontation between Pualiʻi and Nāmakaokapāoʻo, revealing critical tensions around *kapu* (sacred law), chiefly agency, and cultural transformation:
    – The *koʻilipi* (razor) functions as both physical weapon and symbolic ritual tool, recalling instances where aliʻi priests employed human sacrifice to enforce the 'Ai kapu system. Pualiʻi's explicit ritual language (*""kālua me ka 'uala""* – ""baked with sweet potato,"" *""'ai iho aʻu ma mua, a laila noa""* – ""I eat first to free it from taboo"") adapts sacrificial protocol to personal vendetta, signifying the corruption of traditional kapu;
    – Nāmakaokapāoʻo's disregard for the threats (*""ʻaʻohe hoʻolohe""*) embodies *mana koʻikoʻi* (supernatural sovereignty), recalling accounts of god-born heroes (e.g., Kamehameha) whose divine protections manifested under threat (Reference: S.M. Kamakau, *Ruling Chiefs of Hawaiʻi*);

• The *pule make* (death prayer) is rich with metaphysical symbolism:
    – *Aloha wale ka maka o aʻu wahi pāoʻo*: Connects his name's *maka* (eyes) to *pāoʻo* – a tidal pool fish known for regenerative resilience, reflecting the boy as both vulnerable and indestructible (Footnote: Mary Kawena Pukui noted *pāoʻo* symbolizes regeneration in chants);
    – Name sequences carry esoteric meaning:
        *Nā-kukuiʻai-maka-o-ka-lani*: ""The-candlenut-lighting-up-eyeballs-of-the-heavens"" – evokes celestial vision.
        *Nā-maka-o-Kaiʻa*: ""Eyes-that-belong-to-Kaiʻa"" – references an ancient sea spirit, positioning the boy as universal protector;
    – Chant structure follows traditional *kaona* (layered meaning) with dual interpretations:
        – Literal: Nāmakaokapāoʻo describes sacrificial defeat (*""hapupuʻu...hāpāpaʻa""* = shriveled/vulnerable).
        – Symbolic: Power inversion where the oppressed becomes victor (*""Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāoʻo""*);
    – Historical parallel: Lines *""ʻo ka ihe nō me ka pahu""* (spears with points) parallels Kamehameha's chant when unifying Hawaiʻi, identifying Nāmakaokapāoʻo as a timeless unifier figure;

• Core cultural conflict manifests through contrasting actions:
    – Pualiʻi represents decaying 'Ai kapu: Personalizes sacrificial ritual into vengeance ritual (abusing traditional protocol), using an imported *koʻilipi* while attacking native resources (ʻuala);
    – Nāmakaokapāoʻo embodies emergent Hawaiian nationalism: Transcends victimhood through prophetic *pule*, repurposing tradition for self-defense. His chanted *""Heʻe lā!""* (flee!) commands both natural withdrawal (like tides) and martial dominance (like ʻihe warriors);

• Children fleeing (*""holo akula...ma kahi lōʻihi""*) marks social collapse, contrasting earlier accounts about community obligation to receive strangers ('Example 2'). Their abandonment reflects the story's deeper critique: When leaders betray *aloha ʻāina* (earth stewardship), societal bonds disintegrate.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","""Here we will speak briefly about those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a. They were great chiefs of Hawai‘i; Nāmakaokalani was a parent and Nāmakaokai‘a was a child. However, they became immersed within Nāmakaokapāo‘o's prayer.""","**Paragraph 8:**  
• This passage uses **formal genealogical framing** typical of Hawaiian moʻolelo (histories) to introduce two chiefly figures:  
– Names are explicitly foregrounded, signaling their mana (spiritual power) and narrative importance per Hawaiian oral tradition.  
– The parent-child relationship is immediately established through *he makua kāne... he keiki* structure, reinforcing intergenerational continuity central to Hawaiian kinship systems.  

• **Name analysis with cultural etymology:**  
– **Nā-maka-o-ka-lani** (The-eyes-of-the-heavens):  
  – *Maka* (eyes/face) symbolizes perception, guardianship, and spiritual focus.  
  – *Lani* (heavens/sky) associates this chief with divine realms and high chiefly rank, as *lani* was an epithet for highest-ranking aliʻi (chiefs). The name suggests spiritual oversight over the Hawaiian universe.  
– **Nā-maka-o-ka-iʻa** (The-eyes-of-the-fish):  
  – *Iʻa* (fish) represents sustenance, mobility across realms, and oceanic guardianship. Names with fish allusions often denoted guardians of specific fishing grounds in coastal chiefdoms.  
– *Repeated nā-maka-prefix*: These names show phonological kinship with **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo** (the eyes of the tiny goby fish), creating allegorical resonance – possibly indicating ancestral ties to the protagonist.  

• **Cultural implications of ""ua komo i loko o ka pule""** (became immersed in the prayer):  
– *Komolí* (immersion) suggests voluntary absorption into the spiritual act, indicating Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prayer held significant mana powerful enough to influence chiefly ancestors.  
– In traditional Hawaiian religion, *pule* (prayers) were active forces binding past/present, with rituals invoking deified ancestors (*ʻaumākua*). This aligns with documented 'Ai Kapu-era practices where high chiefs mediated between gods and mortals.  
– The phrase implies spiritual entanglement between three generations: the two chiefly forebears present in Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s ritual despite temporal separation.  

• **Theological and political underpinnings:**  
– Positioning foreign chiefs *(no Hawaiʻi)* as agents within Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prayer narrative symbolizes ancestral endorsement of his mana. In Hawaiian cosmology, deified ancestors actively intervened in descendant affairs.  
– The juxtaposition of *heavens*-themed and *ocean*-themed names mirrors core Hawaiian spatial dualities: *lani* (celestial realms) balanced with *kai* (ocean realms) in cosmological geography.  
– The passage may foreshadow ancestral support in Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s coming trials, subtly critiquing post-contact Hawaiian monarchy challenges by invoking pre-unification chiefly lineages.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i.

The head then spoke from elsewhere, greeting Nāmakaokapāo‘o: ""Aloha to you, Nāmakaokapāo‘o."" Nāmakaokapāo‘o then took Puali‘i’s head and threw it into the sea at Waipouli, near a cave along the shore of Honouliuli. The cave’s length measured five miles.","**Paragraph 9 Commentary:**  
• **Supernatural Reversal Dynamics**:  
  – Puali‘i’s intended decapitation of Nāmakaokapāo‘o undergoes a dramatic reversal through supernatural intervention, a recurring motif in Hawaiian mo‘olelo. The phrase *""ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i iā Puali‘i""* (the sharp point turned upon Puali‘i) illustrates the concept of *ho‘opa‘apa‘a* or ""backfire effect,"" where malevolence rebounds onto its perpetrator—reinforced by the victim’s prayer (*pule*) invoking divine protection. This aligns with Hawaiian cosmological principles where spiritual potency (*mana*) shields the righteous (cf. Beckwith’s *Hawaiian Mythology* on reciprocity in sacred conflicts).  
  – The action occurs precisely *after* Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prayer (*pule*), marking a narrative pivot where ritual communication with the divine activates mystical defenses. In ‘Ai Kapū traditions, efficacious prayer often required specific protocols; this instant causality reveals a cultural belief in direct divine intercession.

• **Talking Head as Post-Death Consciousness**:  
  – The severed head (*po‘o*) of Puali‘i retains consciousness—signified by the verb *‘ōlelo mai* (spoke from a distance) and *pane mai* (replied)—indicating a profound disruption of natural law. This symbolizes the *uhane* (spirit) lingering beyond physical death, embodying Hawaiian beliefs surrounding vital energies persisting post-mortem (cf. Pukui’s *Nānā i ke Kumu* on *aumakua* manifestations).  
  – The utterance of ""Aloha ‘oe"" defies expected hostility; this blessing instead signifies the defeated antagonist’s submission or a spiritual reconciliation. Linguistically, the use of *pane* (reply) implies a formal exchange, foregrounding ‘ōlelo Hawai‘i conversational protocols even in supernatural contexts.

• **Symbolic Disposal & Cultural Liminality**:  
  – The disposal at *kai o Waipouli* (sea of Waipouli) and *kahakai o Honouliuli* (beach of Honouliuli) leverages place-name symbolism:  
    * Waipouli: ""Dark Water"" (*wai*: water + *pouli*: dark) evokes primordial darkness (*Pō*)—the ancestral realm where spirits return.  
    * Honouliuli: ""Dark Bay"" (*hono*: bay + *uliuli*: deep blue/dark) doubles the chthonic symbolism.  
  – Throwing remains into water (*kiola i kai*) reflects ritual cleansing from *kapu* violations; oceans were conduits to the ‘afterworld’ (*Kumulipo* cosmology associates sea with deity Kanaloa).  
  – Cave length description (*‘elima mile ka loa*) heightens mythic proportions: Five miles evokes the sacred digit *elima*—linked to the *kinolau* (physical manifestations) of gods like Kāne or creation cycles. The cave (*ana*) itself represents a *puka* (portal) between realms, situating Puali‘i in liminal space as guardian or warning.

• **Name Etymologies & Subliminal Motifs**:  
  – **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o**: ""The Eyes of the Pāo‘o Fish""  
    * *Maka*: Simultaneously means ""eyes,"" ""points"" (as in axe blade), and ""seedlings"" (agricultural cuttings)—echoing earlier thematic tensions where eyes symbolized life essence and sovereignty (cf. commentary on *ulua* substitution rituals in Example 3).  
    * *Pāo‘o*: A slippery shoreline fish (*Eleotris fusca*) metaphorically represents elusiveness—here inverted as the boy dodges harm as skillfully as a *pāo‘o* evades capture.  
  – **Pua-li‘i**: ""Descendant of Chiefs"" (*pua*: descendant; *li‘i*: royal diminutive) contrasts the outcome—his fall signifies the allegorical dismantling of the ‘Ai Kapū aristocracy through the agency of youth.

**Allegorical Interpretation**:  
The sequence encodes a symbolic overthrow of antiquated systems:  
1. The reversed axe blow (*ko‘ilipi*) signifies divine rejection of oppression.  
2. The talking head affirms *aloha* principles over violence, presaging post-contact abolition of human sacrifice—mapping to Kamehameha II’s 1819 dismantling of the ‘Ai Kapū.  
3. Waipouli’s ""dark waters"" foreshadow socio-religious transformation—Puali‘i’s entombment represents the discarded old ways while Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s action signals keiki (child) as a new paradigm’s harbinger.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
