A o‘o ka ‘uala, ‘ōlelo ‘o Puali‘i i kāna ‘ōlelo   ho‘ohiki, “Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala,  a ‘ai ‘o Puali‘i, a laila, noa, ‘ai kāna wahine, Pōka‘ī a  me nā mea ‘ē a‘e. No laila, iho akula ‘o Puali‘i i kai  o Honouliuli e lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today.
