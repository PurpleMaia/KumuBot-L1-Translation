Kauluakaha‘i was his father, from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a high chief from Kahikipapaialewa, and he was also part god.","**Paragraph 1:**
• This opening paragraph adheres to a very common structure in traditional Hawaiian narratives: establishing the protagonist, their lineage, and their place of origin. This sets the stage for the story and immediately imbues the character with significance. The initial description focuses on a seeming paradox – small stature combined with immense strength – a motif frequently found in Hawaiian legends, often signifying a hidden power or a connection to the divine.
– The name **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** (m) (the eyes of the *pāo'o* fish) is immediately striking. *Pāo'o* refers to a type of surgeonfish, known for its vibrant colors and ability to navigate coral reefs. The “eyes” suggest perception, insight, or perhaps a connection to the underwater world, a realm often associated with ancestral spirits and hidden knowledge. The name itself hints at a character who sees things differently or possesses a unique perspective.
• The introduction of **Ka-ulu-a-kaha'i** (m) (the inspiration/breath of Kaha'i) as the father is equally significant. Kaha'i, as referenced in the Pukui & Elbert dictionary, is a legendary figure associated with bringing breadfruit to Hawai'i from Samoa, a journey requiring immense courage and resourcefulness. This connection immediately elevates the father’s status and suggests that Nāmakaokapāo‘o inherits a lineage of explorers and innovators. The father’s origin in **Kahi-kipa-paia-lewa** (Kahiki-stratum-in-the-sky/foreign land in the heavens) and **Kahi-kinu'u** (Kahiki-at-the-summit/foreign land at the peak) is crucial.
– *Kahiki* is not simply a geographical location; it represents the ancestral homeland, a source of knowledge, power, and spiritual connection. Describing it as being “in the sky” or “at the summit” elevates its status, suggesting a realm beyond the mundane, a place of divine origin. This reinforces the idea that the family possesses a connection to the gods and a lineage that extends beyond the islands. The use of two place names, one more ethereal than the other, suggests a layered connection to the ancestral realm.
• **Pō-ka-'ī** (f) (perhaps ‘night falls upon the high chief’) is presented as the mother. The name, while less overtly symbolic than the others, suggests a connection to darkness, mystery, or perhaps a protective quality. The fact that she is mentioned after the father, and with less descriptive detail, is typical in traditional narratives where the male lineage often takes precedence.
• The final statement – that the father is a *ali‘i nui* (high chief) and *‘ao‘ao akua* (part god) – solidifies the family’s elevated status and foreshadows the extraordinary nature of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s story. The phrase *‘ao‘ao akua* is particularly important.
– In pre-contact Hawai'i, the concept of *mana* (spiritual power) was central to social and political structure. Chiefs derived their authority from their *mana*, which was often believed to be inherited from the gods. Being *‘ao‘ao akua* signifies a direct lineage to the divine, granting the father (and, by extension, Nāmakaokapāo‘o) a unique position in society. This also suggests that the story may explore themes of divine intervention, destiny, and the responsibilities that come with possessing such power.
– The combination of high chiefly status and divine ancestry is a common trope in Hawaiian mythology, often used to explain the origins of powerful families and their right to rule. This opening paragraph, therefore, establishes not only the characters but also the foundational elements of a story steeped in Hawaiian cosmology and social hierarchy. The narrative is likely to explore the interplay between human and divine realms, the challenges of leadership, and the enduring power of ancestral connections. The seemingly simple description of a small but strong child is, in fact, a carefully constructed introduction to a world of myth, legend, and profound cultural significance.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This chapter of the Nāmakaokapāo‘o story establishes a foundational narrative of exceptional strength, contested lineage, and ultimately, the assertion of Hawaiian agency in the face of external threat. While presented as a traditional moʻolelo, a close reading reveals potential allegorical resonances with the socio-political upheavals of late 19th and early 20th century Hawaiʻi, particularly the anxieties surrounding land ownership, chiefly authority, and the encroachment of foreign influence. The narrative’s focus on *mana* – spiritual power and authority – manifested through physical prowess, serves as a central thematic element.


The opening passages (1-2) immediately establish Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s exceptional nature, a common trope in Hawaiian mythology denoting a figure destined for greatness, often through overcoming significant challenges. The lineage presented – Kauluakaha‘i, a “high chief…part god” from Kahikipapaialewa – is crucial. Kahikipapaialewa, a land associated with ancestral power and often linked to the akua (gods), grounds Nāmakaokapāo‘o in a traditional Hawaiian cosmological framework. However, the circumstances of his conception, detailed in paragraph 2, introduce an element of social disruption. The act of intimacy occurring in ‘Ewa, a region historically associated with lower status and often a point of contact with outsiders, subtly foreshadows the challenges to traditional hierarchies that will unfold. Pōka‘ī’s subsequent vulnerability and poverty highlight the precariousness of traditional Hawaiian society, even for those of chiefly descent.

The introduction of Puali‘i (paragraphs 3-4) is particularly significant. Puali‘i’s desire for Pōka‘ī, despite her having already borne a child, represents a violation of traditional social norms and a potential usurpation of chiefly lineage. His promise to consume the sweet potato before allowing others to partake is a symbolic act of dominance and control, mirroring the exploitative practices of foreign powers seeking to benefit from Hawaiian resources. The naming of the sweet potato patches after Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and their continued existence “until this day,” suggests a lasting connection to the land and a potential claim to ancestral rights. This connection to the ‘āina (land) is a recurring motif in Hawaiian resistance narratives.

The central conflict (paragraphs 5-9) revolves around Puali‘i’s attempt to assert control over Nāmakaokapāo‘o, culminating in a violent confrontation. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s seemingly disproportionate strength, even as a small child, is not merely a physical attribute but a manifestation of his inherent mana and connection to his ancestors. The act of destroying the sweet potato patches, while seemingly destructive, can be interpreted as a rejection of Puali‘i’s exploitative control over the land’s resources. The recitation of the oli (chant) invoking Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a (paragraph 8) is a critical moment. These named ancestors, explicitly identified as “high chiefs of Hawaiʻi,” provide Nāmakaokapāo‘o with spiritual backing and legitimize his actions. The invocation of these chiefly ancestors is not simply a genealogical recitation; it’s a strategic assertion of Hawaiian sovereignty and a call to ancestral power. The reversal of the expected outcome – Puali‘i’s head being severed and thrown into the sea – is a powerful symbolic act of reclaiming agency and rejecting foreign domination. The distance of five miles, while potentially hyperbolic, emphasizes the complete and utter rejection of Puali‘i’s influence.

The subsequent encounters with ‘Ama‘u (paragraphs 10-14) represent escalating external threats. ‘Ama‘u, a chief from O‘ahu, embodies the growing power of inter-island rivalries and, potentially, the increasing influence of foreign-backed factions. The repeated attempts to defeat Nāmakaokapāo‘o with increasingly large forces (four groups of forty-eight warriors, then eighty war canoes) underscore the relentless pressure faced by those defending Hawaiian sovereignty. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s ultimate victory and establishment of his mother on O‘ahu can be interpreted as a symbolic reclaiming of Hawaiian lands and a reaffirmation of traditional authority.

The chapter’s significance lies in its potential as a coded narrative reflecting the anxieties of a rapidly changing Hawaiʻi. Published during a period of increasing Western influence and political instability, the story of Nāmakaokapāo‘o can be read as an allegory for the struggle to preserve Hawaiian identity and sovereignty. The emphasis on mana, lineage, and connection to the land resonates deeply with traditional Hawaiian values and provides a powerful counter-narrative to the dominant colonial discourse. While the story may appear to be a simple tale of strength and heroism, its underlying themes and symbolic resonances suggest a more complex and politically charged interpretation, positioning it as a significant contribution to Hawaiian literature and cultural analysis. The narrative’s enduring power lies in its ability to simultaneously celebrate Hawaiian resilience and lament the loss of traditional ways of life."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

And Pōka‘ī carried Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, and Pōka‘ī remained with her pregnancy, and later, gave birth. With this birth, Pōka‘ī and her son Nāmakaokapāo‘o were very poor.","**Paragraph 2:**
• This paragraph details the conception and early circumstances surrounding the birth of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, establishing the initial setting and socio-economic conditions of the protagonist’s early life. The narrative shifts focus from introducing the characters to detailing the events leading to and immediately following his birth.
– The location, Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa, is significant. ‘Ewa, generally, is associated with westward travel, and in Hawaiian cosmology, often represents the direction of the setting sun and, symbolically, the land of the ancestors (Po). Hō-‘ae-‘ae (breathing/sighing repeatedly) suggests a place of respite, perhaps even a secluded or hidden location, fitting for the intimate act described. This could also be a poetic reference to the breath of life being given.
• The phrase “launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho” is a euphemistic and poetic way of describing sexual intercourse and subsequent conception. “Launa kino” literally means “joining bodies,” while “me ka moe ‘ana iho” emphasizes the consummation of that union, leading directly to pregnancy. The use of such indirect language is common in traditional Hawaiian storytelling, particularly when dealing with sensitive topics.
– The direct result of this union is “loa‘a ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o” – the obtaining/receiving of Nāmakaokapāo‘o. This phrasing frames the child not merely as a consequence, but as a gift or a blessing, even before his birth.
• The narrative then details the separation of Kauluakaha‘i from Pōka‘ī and the unborn child. He “ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i i kona ‘āina” – returned to his land. This suggests he had responsibilities or obligations elsewhere, potentially related to his chiefly status (as established in the previous paragraph). His departure leaves Pōka‘ī to carry the pregnancy alone.
– This abandonment, or at least temporary separation, is a recurring motif in Hawaiian mythology, often signifying a challenge or hardship the protagonist must overcome. It also highlights the strength and resilience of the female characters, who frequently bear the burden of raising children in difficult circumstances.
• Pōka‘ī’s remaining “me kona hāpai” – with her pregnancy – emphasizes her solitary state. The word “hāpai” itself is significant, meaning both “to carry” (physically, the child) and “to support” (emotionally and materially).
– The subsequent birth is described simply as “ma hope, hānau” – later, birth. This brevity underscores the focus on the *consequences* of the birth, rather than the birthing process itself.
• The final sentence, “Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o,” establishes the socio-economic hardship faced by mother and son. “’Ilihune” means “poor” or “destitute.” This poverty is crucial to understanding the narrative arc.
– The introduction of poverty at this stage is not merely a detail of circumstance; it’s a foundational element of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s character development. In traditional Hawaiian society, hardship often served as a catalyst for demonstrating strength, resourcefulness, and mana (spiritual power). This sets the stage for Nāmakaokapāo‘o to potentially challenge societal norms or overcome obstacles through his own abilities. This could be an allegorical reference to the dismantling of the 'Ai Kapu system, where the ali'i (chiefs) were often wealthy and the maka'āinana (commoners) were poor. The story may be a metaphor for the commoners rising up against the ali'i.
– The repetition of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s name reinforces his importance and foreshadows his central role in the unfolding narrative. The name itself – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish) – continues to be intriguing. The pāo‘o fish is known for its keen eyesight and ability to navigate murky waters, suggesting Nāmakaokapāo‘o may possess similar qualities of perception and resilience. The “eyes” (maka) could also symbolize insight or spiritual awareness.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puali'i looked at Pōka'ī and desired her, and said: “I want you to be my wife.” Pōka'ī replied: “How could you possibly want me? I have already given birth to a child, and my body is ruined.” Puali'i said: “Those things are nothing. If you want me, let us sleep together.” Pōka'ī agreed. And Pōka'ī went with her husband and Puali'i to the plains of Keahumoa, to live.","**Paragraph 3:**


• This paragraph details the initial courtship and subsequent relocation of Pōka'ī and her family, introducing Puali'i as a significant new character. The narrative subtly reveals societal norms surrounding desire, perceived flaws, and the establishment of relationships within a traditional Hawaiian context.

– Character Introduction: Puali'i – The name Pua-(a)li'i (flower/descendant of a chief) suggests a connection to chiefly lineage, even if he is described simply as a “good man.” The use of “maika’i” (good) is a common descriptor, but within the context of a potential suitor, it implies not only moral character but also suitability and desirability. He originates from Līhu'e, a district on Kaua'i, and engages in lawai'a (fishing) at Honouliuli, establishing him as a provider and connected to the resources of the land and sea. His journey to Honouliuli and subsequent visit to Pōka'ī’s home are significant, reflecting the common practice of travel and interaction between ahupua'a (land divisions).

– Pōka'ī’s Hesitation and Societal Expectations – Pōka'ī’s response to Puali'i’s proposal is crucial. Her statement, “Pehea ‘oe e makemake ai ia‘u? Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino,” (How could you possibly want me? I have already given birth to a child, and my body is ruined) reveals a deeply ingrained sense of self-perception influenced by societal expectations. The term “’ino’ino” (ruined, defiled) suggests a cultural understanding of childbirth as potentially diminishing a woman’s physical attractiveness or desirability. This highlights the pressures placed upon women regarding their bodies and their roles within the community. It’s important to note this doesn’t necessarily indicate Pōka’ī believes she is ruined, but rather is articulating the likely societal judgment she anticipates.

– Puali'i’s Reassurance and the Pragmatic Approach to Relationships – Puali'i’s response, “He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua,” (Those things are nothing. If you want me, let us sleep together) is strikingly direct. It demonstrates a pragmatic approach to relationships, prioritizing mutual desire over perceived physical imperfections. This isn’t necessarily a callous disregard for Pōka'ī’s feelings, but rather a straightforward expression of his attraction and a willingness to bypass societal constraints. The phrase “e moe kāua” (let us sleep together) is a euphemism for establishing a long-term relationship, encompassing not just physical intimacy but also a commitment to shared life.

– Relocation to Keahumoa and its Significance – The final sentence, “A ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘ī me kāna kāne me Puali‘i ā ke kula o Keahumoa, noho,” (And Pōka'ī went with her husband and Puali'i to the plains of Keahumoa, to live) is particularly telling. The inclusion of “kāna kāne” (her husband) alongside Puali'i suggests a complex dynamic. It’s unclear if this is a formal acknowledgement of a polygamous relationship, a transitional period, or a nuanced way of acknowledging the existing familial ties. Keahumoa (heap of chickens) is a place name on Kaua'i, and the act of relocating signifies a shift in Pōka'ī’s life and a commitment to a new future with Puali'i. The “noho” (to live, to dwell) at the end emphasizes the establishment of a new household and a new chapter in their lives.

• Contextualizing within the 'Ai Kapu Era: While the narrative doesn’t explicitly mention the 'Ai Kapu system, the societal pressures surrounding female desirability and the pragmatic approach to relationships can be understood within that historical context. The 'Ai Kapu era (roughly 1100-1819) was characterized by strict social hierarchies and kapu (sacred laws) that governed all aspects of life. While relationships were often based on lineage and political alliances, personal desire and pragmatic considerations also played a role. Pōka'ī’s hesitation and Puali'i’s directness reflect the tensions between traditional expectations and individual agency within that system. The relocation to Keahumoa could also be interpreted as a move to a new ahupua'a to establish a new social standing and potentially escape the constraints of their previous community.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

When the sweet potatoes grew, Puali'i spoke his promised words, “The head of the ulua will be cooked with the sweet potato, and Puali'i will eat, and then, it will be released, Pōka'ī, his wife, and the others will eat. Therefore, Puali'i went down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with the sweet potato.”","**Paragraph 4:**
• This paragraph establishes a sense of continuity and permanence, linking the present to the past through the enduring presence of the sweet potato patches and their connection to Nāmakaokapāo'o. The repetition of “ā hiki i kēia lā” (until this day) emphasizes this temporal connection and suggests the story’s relevance extends beyond its immediate narrative.
– The two sweet potato patches, “’elua āna mau māla ‘uala lō‘ihi,” are significant. The number two often represents duality in Hawaiian cosmology – creation through union, opposing forces, or the balance between *kāne* (male) and *wahine* (female). Their length, “lō‘ihi,” suggests abundance and sustained cultivation, hinting at a stable food source and a settled existence.
• The naming of the patches after Nāmakaokapāo'o is crucial. This is not merely a descriptive act; it’s a bestowal of *mana* (spiritual power) upon the land, associating the child with the fertility and sustenance of the area.
– *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o* (the eyes of the *pāo'o* fish) continues to be a potent symbol. As previously discussed, *pāo'o* likely alludes to *po'o* (head), suggesting a connection to intellect, leadership, or even sacrifice. The “eyes” could represent perception, foresight, or the ability to see beyond the immediate. The continued association of the child’s name with the land reinforces this symbolic link.
• Puali'i’s reiterated promise regarding the *ulua* and sweet potato is central to understanding the power dynamics and cultural context. This isn’t simply a statement of intent regarding a meal; it’s a reaffirmation of his authority and a demonstration of his adherence to traditional practices.
– The phrase “Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala” (The head of the ulua will be cooked with the sweet potato) is particularly loaded. As noted in previous analyses, the *ulua* held a significant place in Hawaiian ritual, often serving as a substitute for human sacrifice during the *‘Ai Kapu* era. The cooking of the head specifically suggests a complete offering, a severing of the connection between the physical and spiritual realms. The pairing with sweet potato, a staple food, implies a sharing of *mana* – the *ulua’s* spiritual power being transferred to those who consume it alongside the nourishing sweet potato.
– The sequence of eating – Puali'i first, then Pōka'ī, and “the others” – establishes a clear hierarchy. Puali'i, as the provider and ritual leader, consumes first, receiving the full benefit of the offering. Pōka'ī, his wife, follows, and then the rest of the community. This reflects the stratified social structure of ancient Hawai'i. The phrase “noa, ‘ai kāna wahine” (released, his wife will eat) suggests a lifting of *kapu* (restriction) after Puali'i’s consumption, allowing others to partake.
• Puali'i’s subsequent action – going to Honouliuli to fish – is a practical step towards fulfilling his promise. Honouliuli (dark bay) is a specific location, grounding the narrative in a tangible landscape.
– The act of fishing itself is symbolic. It represents the acquisition of sustenance, the mastery of the natural world, and the continuation of traditional practices. The intention to eat the fish *with* the sweet potato reinforces the connection between the land and the sea, between agriculture and fishing, and between the spiritual and the material.
• This paragraph, taken as a whole, paints a picture of a society deeply rooted in tradition, where ritual and sustenance are intertwined. Puali'i’s actions demonstrate his commitment to maintaining the established order, while the continued association of Nāmakaokapāo'o with the land suggests a potential challenge to that order, or perhaps a reinterpretation of it. The emphasis on the *ulua* and sweet potato points towards the complex relationship between humans, the gods, and the natural world in ancient Hawai'i, and foreshadows potential conflict or transformation within the narrative. The promise of a shared meal, while seemingly benevolent, is also a demonstration of power and control, setting the stage for future events.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo'o’s body at that time was very small, two cubits and a half was his height, he wasn’t sturdy, he was thin. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, he told the children, “Pull up the vines and all the sweet potato leaves completely, don’t leave any to grow.” But the children were afraid, so they cautiously touched the sweet potatoes, not pulling up the vines.","**Paragraph 5:**


• This paragraph marks a shift in the narrative, introducing a deliberate act of potential destruction and highlighting the contrast between Nāmakaokapāo'o’s command and the children’s hesitancy. The introduction of seventeen children is significant, hinting at a potential collective agency or a symbolic representation of a larger group. The setting returns to the vital resource of ‘uala (sweet potato), reinforcing its importance within the story’s unfolding themes.

– Character Dynamics: Pua-li'i’s absence while Nāmakaokapāo'o leads the children to the ‘uala patches is notable. It suggests a delegation of responsibility, or perhaps a deliberate attempt to distance himself from the impending action. Nāmakaokapāo'o, despite his small stature, asserts authority over a group significantly larger than himself, demonstrating a precocious, and potentially disruptive, power dynamic.

• Physical Description & Symbolism: The detailed description of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s physical form – “two cubits and a half” (roughly 3-4 feet) – emphasizes his diminutive size. The phrase “’a‘ole i pa‘a kona ma‘i, e lewalewa ana nō” (he wasn’t sturdy, he was thin) further underscores his frailty. This physical vulnerability contrasts sharply with the strength alluded to earlier in the story and foreshadows potential challenges. The use of the traditional Hawaiian unit of measurement, the kapua‘i (cubit – the length from elbow to fingertip), roots the narrative firmly in Hawaiian tradition.

– Nāmakaokapāo'o – Name Analysis: The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (eyes of the pāo'o fish) continues to resonate. The pāo'o fish is a bottom-dwelling species, often associated with hidden depths and a somewhat unsettling appearance. The “eyes” suggest perception and awareness, perhaps hinting at Nāmakaokapāo'o’s ability to see beyond the surface. The name, combined with his small stature, could symbolize a seemingly insignificant figure possessing profound insight.

• The Command & The Hesitation: Nāmakaokapāo'o’s command – “E huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala ā pau loa i luna, mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana” (Pull up the vines and all the sweet potato leaves completely, don’t leave any to grow) – is strikingly harsh and destructive. It represents a complete rejection of the natural cycle of growth and renewal. The children’s fear and subsequent cautiousness (“maka‘u nō ua keiki, no laila, kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala, ‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e”) reveal a respect for the ‘uala and a reluctance to participate in its destruction.

– Cultural Context – ‘Ai Kapu & Resource Management: This scene can be interpreted through the lens of the ‘Ai Kapu era (pre-contact Hawaiian society). The ‘uala was a staple food source, and its cultivation was deeply intertwined with spiritual beliefs and social structures. Deliberately destroying a food source would have been a serious transgression, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of the community. The children’s hesitation suggests an ingrained understanding of this cultural taboo. The act of pulling up the vines, preventing regrowth, could symbolize a rejection of traditional agricultural practices and a disruption of the mālama ‘āina (caring for the land) principle.

• Allegorical Interpretation: The scene can be read allegorically as a representation of the clash between traditional Hawaiian values and external forces. Nāmakaokapāo'o, as a disruptive force, embodies a rejection of the established order. The children, representing the community, are torn between obedience to authority and their inherent respect for the land. The ‘uala patch itself symbolizes the cultural heritage and resources of Hawai'i, threatened by destructive forces. The fact that the children don’t fully carry out the command offers a glimmer of hope, suggesting a resistance to complete cultural annihilation. The seventeen children could represent the seventeen generations of Hawaiians, all of whom are tasked with protecting the land.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p6,1,6,"I ia wā, noke aku ana ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ka  huhuki ā pau kekahi māla ‘uala ā luna o kekahi  māla ‘uala, pēlā nō ka huhuki ‘ana ā pau nā māla  ‘elua ā kū ke āhua o ka lau o ka ‘uala, he kanahā  āhua ka nui o nā māla ‘elua.

Then, Nāmakaokapāo'o went back and lit a fire to broil four vines of sweet potato over the burning fire pit. As he was broiling the vines over the fire, his stepfather returned quickly and arrived, asking his mother, Pōka'ī: “No.” Puali'i replied: “Yes, his head and eyes are what will accompany my sweet potato today, therefore, today is the day he will cause my death.”","**Paragraph 6:**


• This paragraph details a significant escalation in Nāmakaokapāo'o’s behavior, moving from simple mischief to outright destructive acts, and reveals a simmering tension between him and his stepfather, Puali'i, culminating in a thinly veiled death threat. The imagery is rich with symbolic weight, particularly concerning the ‘uala (sweet potato) and its connection to sustenance, lineage, and potentially, sacrifice.

– Destruction and Quantification: Nāmakaokapāo'o’s relentless tearing up of the sweet potato patches is not merely childish vandalism. The repetition of “huhuki” (to pull, yank) emphasizes the forceful and deliberate nature of his actions. The quantification – “he kanahā āhua ka nui o nā māla ‘elua” (forty mounds in all from the two patches) – is striking. Numbers in Hawaiian tradition often carry symbolic meaning beyond simple quantity. Forty could represent a period of trial or testing, or a complete cycle. The creation of mounds (āhua) themselves is significant; mounds were often sacred spaces (kuahu) or burial sites, suggesting Nāmakaokapāo'o is disrupting something fundamentally important to the land and its people.

– The ‘Uala as Symbol: The ‘uala is central to this scene. It was, and remains, a staple food in Hawai'i, representing sustenance and abundance. However, it also held deeper cultural significance. The ‘uala is propagated through the maka (eyes/nodes) of the vine, which are replanted to grow new plants. This connects the ‘uala to genealogy and the continuation of lineage. Nāmakaokapāo'o’s destruction of the patches, therefore, can be interpreted as an attack on the very foundations of life and ancestry. The act of broiling the vines – ‘ōhinu akula ‘ehā ‘au o ka ‘uala’ – further emphasizes this disruption. Broiling, while a method of cooking, also implies a wilting, a diminishing of life force. The number four (‘ehā) could represent the four gods (Kāne, Kū, Lono, Kanaloa) or the four cardinal directions, suggesting a disruption of cosmic order.

– Puali'i’s Reaction and the Threat: Puali'i’s swift return (“kōlea ā hiki”) and immediate questioning of Pōka'ī indicate his deep concern and anger. His initial response, “'A'ole” (No), is ambiguous. Is he denying that Nāmakaokapāo'o is responsible? Or is he refusing to acknowledge the severity of the situation? Puali'i’s subsequent statement is chilling: “'Ae, ‘o ke po‘o ona a me nā maka ka mea e ‘īna‘i ai ku‘u ‘uala i kēia lā, no laila, eia kona lā e make ai ia‘u.” (Yes, his head and eyes are what will accompany my sweet potato today, therefore, today is the day he will cause my death). This is a clear threat of violence, framed within the context of the ‘uala.

– Allegorical Interpretation and the ‘Ai Kapu: The threat to consume Nāmakaokapāo'o’s head (po'o) and eyes (maka) alongside the sweet potato is particularly potent. As noted in previous analyses, the head often represents mana (spiritual power) and the eyes represent perception and lineage. Puali'i’s statement echoes the practices of the ‘Ai Kapu era, where human sacrifice was sometimes associated with agricultural rituals to ensure fertility and abundance. However, Puali'i’s phrasing is twisted. He doesn’t offer Nāmakaokapāo'o as a sacrifice to the gods; he intends to eat him with his meal. This inversion suggests a clinging to the old ways, a desperate attempt to control the land and its resources through violent means, rather than embracing a new order. The ‘ulua fish, previously mentioned, served as a substitute for human sacrifice during the ‘Ai Kapu, and Puali’i’s statement can be seen as a regression to the older, more brutal practice.

– Name Etymology and Symbolic Resonance: Considering the name Nāmakaokapāo'o – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) – the threat to consume his eyes takes on an even deeper significance. The pāo'o fish is known for its large, prominent eyes. To consume the eyes is to destroy the very essence of his being, his ability to see and perceive the world. This also reinforces the connection between ‘maka’ (eyes) and the ‘maka’ (nodes) of the sweet potato vine, suggesting a symbolic attempt to eradicate the lineage and potential for future growth represented by Nāmakaokapāo'o. Puali'i - Pua-(a)li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line) - represents the old guard, desperately trying to maintain control in a changing world.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw and ran to stand far away, frightened of Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: “Behold! Here is the knife in my hand, it is a thing to cut off your head today, and your head will be severed, then roasted with the sweet potato, and I will eat it first, and then it will be free (noa).” Nāmakaokapāo'o did not listen to these words of Puali'i, and then Puali'i spoke again, it was the second time. Puali'i prepared to cut Nāmakaokapāo'o with the knife, and at that moment Nāmakaokapāo'o recited his death chant for Puali'i. He chanted: “Beloved is the eye of my pāo'o (fish), O hapupu'u, O hāpāpa'a, may it be eaten or left, may Nākukui‘aimakaokalani leave it. Nākukui‘aimakaokalani is that one, he is my companion, Nāmakaokai‘a is the high chief of Hawai'i. Let it drift, let the spear drift aimlessly, a man with a spear, the spear with a shield, death to Nāmakaokapāo'o.”","**Paragraph 7:**


• This paragraph marks a critical escalation in the conflict between Puali'i and Nāmakaokapāo'o, culminating in a ritualized threat of violence and Nāmakaokapāo'o’s counter-ritual – a death chant. The imagery is steeped in symbolism relating to food, power, and the precariousness of life. The introduction of the ko‘ilipi (knife) is not merely a practical detail, but a symbolic instrument of power and potential sacrifice.

– The Knife (Ko‘ilipi): The ko‘ilipi is presented not just as a tool, but as a direct threat to Nāmakaokapāo'o’s life. Puali'i’s dramatic presentation of it – “Behold! Here is the knife in my hand…” – echoes the pronouncements of a kahuna (priest) delivering a judgment. The intention to sever the head and consume it with the sweet potato is a direct inversion of proper food offering protocols and a disturbing echo of human sacrifice practices from the 'Ai Kapu era. This suggests Puali'i is clinging to older, more brutal traditions.

– The Children’s Fear: The reaction of the children – fleeing in fear – highlights the gravity of the situation and the perceived danger of Puali'i. Their distance symbolizes the separation between the old ways (represented by Puali'i) and the future (potentially represented by Nāmakaokapāo'o). It also underscores the disruption of lokahi (harmony) within the community.

• Puali'i’s threat is framed as a conditional offering: he will consume Nāmakaokapāo'o after the sweet potato, and then it will be noa (free, purified). This is a twisted application of the concept of noa, usually achieved through proper ritual and offering to the gods. Here, Puali'i attempts to legitimize his violent intent through a perversion of religious practice. The phrase “noa” is used to signify the end of a taboo, but in this context, it’s a chilling declaration of finality.

• Nāmakaokapāo'o’s response is not one of fear or pleading, but of ritualized defiance. He doesn’t argue or attempt to reason with Puali'i; instead, he launches into a oli (chant), specifically a pule make (death chant). This is a crucial turning point.

– The Death Chant (Pule Make): The chant is complex and layered with symbolic meaning. The opening lines, “Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o,” are particularly significant. Aloha here isn’t necessarily a greeting of love, but a lament, a recognition of the preciousness of life, even as it is threatened. Maka (eye) is a recurring motif, linking back to Nāmakaokapāo'o’s name – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (eyes of the pāo'o fish). This reinforces the idea that his identity is intrinsically tied to vision, perception, and perhaps, a connection to the ocean and its creatures. Pāo'o (pāo'o fish) – a deep-sea fish known for its large eyes – could also be a poetic reference to po'o (head), as suggested earlier.

– Nākukui‘aimakaokalani: The invocation of Nākukui‘aimakaokalani is the most enigmatic part of the chant. Nākukui – likely derived from kūki (to swell, to rise) and ‘ai (to eat, consume) – suggests a being associated with growth and sustenance. ‘Aimakaokalani – ‘ai (eat), maka (eye), oka (to consume), lani (heaven) – further reinforces this connection to nourishment and divine vision. This figure is presented as Nāmakaokapāo'o’s aikāne (companion, friend, lover), suggesting a powerful ally or spiritual protector. The plea for Nākukui‘aimakaokalani to “leave it” (let Puali'i’s threat pass) is a desperate attempt to invoke divine intervention.

– Nāmakaokai‘a: The final lines, identifying Nāmakaokai‘a as the high chief of Hawai'i, are a bold assertion of power and lineage. This is a direct challenge to Puali'i’s authority. Nāmakaokai‘a – nā (the), maka (eye), o (of), kai (sea), ‘a (and) – suggests a connection to the ocean and a lineage rooted in the sea. The repetition of “Let it drift, let the spear drift aimlessly” is a symbolic dismantling of Puali'i’s aggressive intent. The spear (ihe) and shield (pahu) represent traditional implements of warfare, but their aimless drifting suggests their powerlessness against Nāmakaokapāo'o’s spiritual defenses. The final declaration, “Death to Nāmakaokapāo'o,” is not a statement of fact, but a desperate wish, a curse uttered by Puali'i, countered by Nāmakaokapāo'o’s chant.

• The entire scene is a microcosm of the larger cultural conflict at play. Puali'i represents the remnants of the 'Ai Kapu system, clinging to power through intimidation and a distorted understanding of ritual. Nāmakaokapāo'o, through his defiance and his invocation of ancient chants, embodies a new, more resilient spirit, one that draws strength from the land, the sea, and the ancestors. The chant is not merely a defense; it is an assertion of identity and a declaration of sovereignty. The ambiguity of the chant’s outcome – will Nāmakaokapāo'o survive? – leaves the reader suspended in anticipation, poised for the next act of this unfolding drama.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

• This paragraph introduces two new figures, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, establishing their chiefly status and familial relationship, while simultaneously linking them to the central protagonist, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, through a spiritual connection – specifically, inclusion within his prayers. This is a common narrative technique in Hawaiian moʻolelo (stories) to establish lineage and demonstrate the power dynamics at play. The inclusion of names *before* detailing their roles is also typical, emphasizing the mana (spiritual power) inherent in the name itself.


• Let's break down the names:
– Nāmakaokalani: Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (Eyes of the Heaven/Sky). This name suggests a connection to the celestial realm, potentially indicating high rank or divine ancestry. The “maka” element, as seen in Nāmakaokapāo‘o, continues the motif of sight, perception, and perhaps even surveillance or knowledge. “Lani” signifies royalty and the heavens, a place of the gods.
– Nāmakaokai‘a: Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (Eyes of the Fish). This name links the individual to the ocean and its resources, a vital aspect of Hawaiian life and sustenance. The “i‘a” element, representing fish, could also symbolize abundance, fertility, or a connection to specific ocean deities. The contrast between “lani” (heaven) and “i‘a” (fish) is significant, potentially representing a duality or balance between the spiritual and material worlds.

• The statement that Nāmakaokalani was a father and Nāmakaokai‘a a child is deliberately simple. It establishes a clear generational relationship, but the phrasing is somewhat unusual. It doesn’t specify whose father and child they are, creating ambiguity. This ambiguity is likely intentional, hinting at a complex genealogy or a deliberate obfuscation of lineage – a common tactic in Hawaiian oral traditions to protect sacred knowledge or to emphasize the fluidity of relationships. It’s possible they are literal father and child, but equally plausible they represent ancestral figures whose relationship is symbolic rather than strictly biological.

• The final clause, “akā, ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (but they entered into the prayers of Nāmakaokapāo‘o), is the most crucial. This suggests Nāmakaokapāo‘o possesses a spiritual power that allows him to influence or incorporate these high-ranking ancestors into his own practice. This could indicate several things:
– Mana and Spiritual Authority: Nāmakaokapāo‘o is not merely a strong child; he is a spiritually potent figure capable of commanding the attention of his ancestors. This aligns with the Hawaiian belief in the interconnectedness of the living and the dead and the importance of ancestral veneration.
– Ritual Practice: The phrase “komo i loko o ka pule” (entered into the prayers) implies a deliberate act of inclusion. Nāmakaokapāo‘o is actively invoking these ancestors, perhaps seeking their guidance, protection, or assistance. This suggests a sophisticated understanding of Hawaiian ritual practices.
– Potential for Disruption: The act of incorporating ancestors into one’s own prayers could also be interpreted as a challenge to traditional hierarchies. By bringing these high chiefs into his sphere of influence, Nāmakaokapāo‘o may be subtly asserting his own authority and redefining the boundaries of power. This is particularly relevant if we consider the potential allegorical interpretation of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a figure challenging the established order, perhaps even prefiguring the societal shifts that occurred with the arrival of Western influences and the dismantling of the 'Ai Kapu system. The ancestors, in this context, might represent the old ways, being re-interpreted and utilized by a new generation.
– Genealogical Claim: It is also possible that Nāmakaokapāo‘o is attempting to legitimize his own claim to chiefly status by invoking these ancestors. By including them in his prayers, he is symbolically aligning himself with their mana and asserting his right to inherit their legacy.

• The lack of further elaboration on the nature of these prayers is significant. It leaves the reader to speculate about Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s motivations and the specific rituals he employs. This ambiguity is characteristic of Hawaiian storytelling, which often relies on suggestion and implication rather than explicit explanation. It invites the audience to actively participate in the creation of meaning and to draw upon their own cultural knowledge to interpret the narrative.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p9,1,9,"A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o, i ia wā i  ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o, e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i  iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē.

The head of Puali'i responded to Nāmakaokapāo'o: “Greetings to you, Nāmakaokapāo'o.” Nāmakaokapāo'o grabbed the head of Puali'i and threw it into the ocean at Waipouli, a hole on the shore of Honouliuli, its length being five miles.","**Paragraph 9:**


• This paragraph marks a dramatic turning point in the narrative, a violent act followed by the seemingly impossible – the severed head of Puali'i speaking. The imagery is stark and laden with symbolic weight, likely referencing a dismantling of traditional power structures and a shift in the spiritual order. The swiftness of the action – immediately following the prayers – suggests a decisive break rather than a prolonged conflict.

– Nāmakaokapāo'o’s Prayers: The nature of these prayers is not specified, but their completion acts as a catalyst for Puali'i’s attack. This implies the prayers were either a challenge to Puali'i’s authority, a plea for assistance from other deities, or a ritual intended to empower Nāmakaokapāo'o for this very confrontation. The lack of detail invites speculation about the specific beliefs and practices at play.

– The Coconut Shell (ko‘ilipi): The use of a coconut shell as a weapon is significant. While seemingly mundane, the coconut (niu) held immense cultural importance in ancient Hawai'i. It was a source of food, drink, and materials for tools and containers. The ko‘i (sharp-edged tool) fashioned from the coconut shell, however, represents a perversion of this life-giving resource into an instrument of death. This could symbolize the corruption of traditional sustenance and the turning of beneficial elements against the people. The act of cutting with the shell, rather than a traditionally crafted weapon, further emphasizes a rejection of established methods.

– Severance and Speech: The description of the head being severed and then speaking from “another place” (kahi ‘ē) is a clear indication of supernatural intervention. This is not a simple decapitation; it’s a transformation. The head retaining consciousness and the ability to speak suggests a separation of mana (spiritual power) from the body. This echoes beliefs about the ‘uhane (spirit) being able to exist independently of the physical form. The head’s location being “another place” could refer to the spirit world, or a different dimension of reality.

– Puali'i’s Greeting (“Aloha ‘oe”): The greeting from the severed head is profoundly unsettling. Aloha carries layers of meaning – love, affection, compassion, but also greeting and farewell. In this context, it’s likely a sardonic acknowledgement of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s power, a final act of defiance, or even a blessing disguised as a curse. The use of ‘oe (you) specifically singles out Nāmakaokapāo'o, making the greeting intensely personal.

– Nāmakaokapāo'o’s Action & Waipouli: Nāmakaokapāo'o’s act of grabbing and throwing the head into the ocean at Waipouli is a symbolic disposal of Puali'i’s authority and influence. Waipouli, described as a hole (ana) on the shore of Honouliuli, is a liminal space – a boundary between land and sea, the known and the unknown. Throwing the head into this hole suggests a banishment to the spirit world, a severing of ties to the earthly realm. The extraordinary length of the hole – five miles – is likely hyperbole, emphasizing the vastness of the ocean and the finality of Puali'i’s fate. It could also be a metaphorical representation of the depth of the spiritual realm.

• Name Etymologies:
– Puali‘i: – Pua (flower, blossom, child of chiefly rank) + li‘i (small, young, chief). This name suggests a youthful leader, perhaps one who is still developing his power. The act of decapitation could represent the premature end of his potential.
– Nāmakaokapāo‘o: – Nā (the) + maka (eyes) + o (of) + ka (the) + pāo‘o (pāo‘o fish). As previously discussed, the name likely alludes to the head (po'o) and eyes (maka) as symbols of perception and authority. The association with the pāo‘o fish, a deep-sea fish, could suggest a connection to the ocean and the spirit world.

• Allegorical Interpretation: This scene can be interpreted as an allegory for the dismantling of the 'Ai Kapu system. Puali'i, representing the old order, is violently overthrown by Nāmakaokapāo'o, who embodies a new, potentially disruptive force. The severed head speaking and being cast into the ocean symbolizes the rejection of traditional beliefs and the embrace of a new spiritual paradigm. The exaggerated scale of the hole at Waipouli reinforces the idea of a profound and irreversible shift in power. The act of using a coconut shell, a resource of life, to inflict death, could represent the corruption of the old ways and the need for radical change. This paragraph, therefore, is not merely a depiction of violence, but a symbolic representation of a cultural and spiritual revolution.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
