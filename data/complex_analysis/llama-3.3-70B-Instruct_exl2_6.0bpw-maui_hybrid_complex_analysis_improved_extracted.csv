There were no equal to him in strength and bravery in these islands from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau. His father was Kauluakaha‘i, from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinu‘u. His mother was Pōka‘ī. His father, a high chief from Kahikipapaialewa, had a divine aspect to him.","• The introduction of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a small but exceptionally strong child may symbolize the resilience and adaptability of the Hawaiian people during times of change and challenge.
  – This characterization could be seen as a reflection of the post-contact period, where Hawaiians had to navigate the introduction of new diseases, technologies, and cultural influences (e.g., the 1819 abandonment of the 'Ai Kapu era and the subsequent influence of Christian missionaries).
  – The emphasis on Nāmakaokapāo‘o's strength and bravery may also represent the traditional Hawaiian values of physical and spiritual courage, as embodied in the concept of ""ko'a"" (courage, bravery) (Handy, 1972).

• The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o breaks down into Nā (the, belonging to), maka (eyes), o (of), ka (the), and pāo'o (shaft, stem, or backbone), potentially signifying a connection to ancestral knowledge, vision, or spiritual guidance.
  – The etymology of Nāmakaokapāo‘o may suggest that the character represents a link to the past, with ""maka"" implying a connection to the gods or ancestral beings (Beckwith, 1981).
  – This name could also be seen as symbolic of the importance of maintaining a strong spiritual backbone or connection to tradition in the face of external influences.

• The mention of Kauluakaha‘i as Nāmakaokapāo‘o's father and a high chief from Kahikipapaialewa highlights the significance of genealogy and ali‘i (chiefly) status in traditional Hawaiian society.
  – The reference to Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinu‘u, may indicate a connection to specific historical or cultural events, such as the battles and alliances between ali‘i during the late 18th and early 19th centuries (Kuykendall, 1938).
  – The characterization of Kauluakaha‘i as having a divine aspect (""he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona"") may symbolize the traditional Hawaiian concept of mana (spiritual power, authority), which was often associated with ali‘i and their connection to the gods (Valeri, 1985).

• The narrative's focus on the relationships between Nāmakaokapāo‘o, his parents, and his ancestral lands may serve as a commentary on the importance of ohana (family) and ‘āina (land) in Hawaiian culture and identity.
  – The emphasis on these relationships could be seen as a reflection of the Hawaiian concept of aloha ‘āina (love for the land), which encompasses not only the physical environment but also the social and spiritual connections to the land and one's ancestors (Trask, 1999).
  – This narrative thread may also represent a critique of the disruptions to traditional Hawaiian social structures and relationships caused by colonialism and the introduction of Western concepts of land ownership and family (Sahlins, 1995).","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","The chapter presents the story of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a young child of remarkable strength and bravery, born to a high chief and a woman named Pōka‘ī. Throughout the passages, several major themes emerge, including the importance of genealogy, the complexities of family relationships, the struggle for power and authority, and the consequences of violence and death.

The historical and cultural context of this narrative is deeply rooted in ancient Hawaiian society, where genealogy and family lineage played a crucial role in determining social status, power, and authority. The story reflects the cultural values of the time, including the importance of ohana (family) and the concept of mana (spiritual power), which was believed to be passed down through generations.

The chapter's significance in Hawaiian literature lies in its unique blend of mythology, history, and cultural commentary. The narrative offers insights into the social hierarchies, cultural practices, and spiritual beliefs of ancient Hawaiian society, providing a window into the past. The story of Nāmakaokapāo‘o also explores the complexities of human nature, including the capacity for both good and evil, and the consequences of one's actions.

A cohesive narrative emerges from the individual passages, which can be summarized as follows: Nāmakaokapāo‘o is born to a high chief and Pōka‘ī, and despite his small stature, he possesses extraordinary strength and bravery. As he grows up, he faces various challenges, including the threat posed by his stepfather, Puali‘i, who seeks to kill him. Nāmakaokapāo‘o ultimately defeats Puali‘i and goes on to face other adversaries, including the chief ‘Ama‘u and his warriors. Through his victories and struggles, Nāmakaokapāo‘o emerges as a powerful and complex figure, driven by a desire for survival, recognition, and respect.

The narrative is also notable for its exploration of the relationships between characters, particularly the complex and often fraught relationships between family members. The story highlights the tensions and conflicts that can arise within families, as well as the importance of loyalty, duty, and honor. Ultimately, the chapter presents a rich and nuanced portrait of ancient Hawaiian society, offering insights into the cultural, historical, and literary contexts that shaped the narrative.

In terms of the historical and cultural context, it is worth noting that the story of Nāmakaokapāo‘o reflects the social and political realities of ancient Hawaii, where chiefs and ali‘i (noble) classes held significant power and influence. The narrative also touches on the importance of land and place in Hawaiian culture, with the story unfolding against the backdrop of specific locations, such as ‘Ewa, Honouliuli, and Waikīkī.

Overall, the chapter provides a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of ancient Hawaiian society, culture, and literature, offering insights into the complexities and nuances of human experience in a unique and fascinating cultural context."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Pōka‘ī carried Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, and Pōka‘ī stayed with her child, and later, gave birth. In this birth, Pōka‘ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were extremely joyful.","• The narrative's setting in Hō‘ae‘ae, ‘Ewa, signifies a connection to the land and ancestral heritage, which is a prevalent theme in traditional Hawaiian stories.
  – The mention of specific geographical locations may allude to the importance of ‘āina (land) in Hawaiian cultural identity and the concept of aloha ‘āina (love for the land), as discussed by Lilikalā Kame‘eleihiwa (1992).
  – This emphasis on place and ancestral ties may also reflect the Hawaiian value of mālama ‘āina (caring for the land), highlighting the interdependence between the people and their environment.

• The character names, such as Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, hold significant allegorical meaning and etymological importance.
  – Breaking down the name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o into its components: Nā- (the) + maka (eyes) + o (of) + ka (the) + pāo'o (trembling or volcanic activity), we can interpret Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a representation of the powerful and dynamic natural forces that shape the Hawaiian landscape.
  – The name Pōka‘ī, which can be broken down into Pō (night) + ka‘ī (sea or ocean), may symbolize the feminine, receptive, and nurturing aspects of the ocean and the Nacht (night), as noted by Martha Beckwith (1940).

• The story's historical context and potential post-contact influences should be considered when analyzing the narrative.
  – The narrative may have been recorded during the post-1820 missionary influence period, which could have introduced biases or alterations to the original story, as discussed by Noenoe Silva (2004).
  – The abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu era in 1819 and the subsequent shift in Hawaiian societal structures may also be reflected in the story's themes and characterizations, highlighting the complexities of cultural transition and transformation.

• The narrative's use of birth and conception as a plot device may symbolize the cyclical nature of life, death, and renewal in Hawaiian culture.
  – The emphasis on the joy and celebration surrounding Nāmakaokapāo‘o's birth may represent the Hawaiian value of aloha (love) and the importance of ohana (family) ties, as explored by Mary Kawena Pukui (1983).
  – This focus on birth and new life may also allude to the Hawaiian concept of ho‘oponopono (restoration and balance), highlighting the need for balance and harmony in all aspects of life, including the relationships between people, land, and the divine.

• The character of Kauluakaha‘i, who returns to his land, may represent the tension between traditional Hawaiian practices and the influence of external factors, such as foreign governance or cultural assimilation.
  – The name Kauluakaha‘i, which can be broken down into Kaulua ( lei or garland) + kaha‘i (sea or ocean), may symbolize the connection between the natural world and the cultural practices of the Hawaiian people, as noted by Samuel Kamakau (1865).
  – Kauluakaha‘i's departure may signify the challenges faced by Native Hawaiians in maintaining their cultural identity and sovereignty in the face of external pressures and historical events, such as the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puali‘i saw Pōka‘ī and desired her, saying: ""I desire you as my wife."" Pōka‘ī replied: ""Why do you desire me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is tired."" Puali‘i said: ""Those things are nothing, if you desire me, we will sleep together."" Pōka‘ī agreed. And Pōka‘ī returned with her husband and Puali‘i to the plain of Keahumoa, and they stayed.","• The narrative presents an encounter between Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī that can be interpreted as a clash between traditional Hawaiian values and the emerging influence of post-contact social norms.
  – The fact that Puali‘i, a man from Līhu‘e, expresses his desire for Pōka‘ī despite her recent childbirth and physical condition may symbolize the disruptions to traditional Hawaiian social structures and values following the 1819 abandonment of the 'Ai Kapu system.
  – This interaction might also reflect the changing attitudes towards women's roles and bodily autonomy in the early 19th century, as influenced by missionary teachings (c.f., Kahakauwila, 2014).

• An analysis of the characters' names provides insight into their symbolic roles within the narrative.
  – Puali‘i can be broken down into Pua-li‘i, where ""pua"" means flower or offspring, and ""li‘i"" signifies royalty or chiefly status. This etymology suggests that Puali‘i represents a figure of nobility or a symbol of traditional Hawaiian leadership.
  – Pōka‘ī, on the other hand, can be understood as Pō-ka-‘ī, with ""pō"" referring to the night or darkness, and ""ka"" being a definite article, and ""‘ī"" signifying a22small or insignificant thing. This could imply that Pōka‘ī embodies the mysterious or the unknown, potentially representing the complexities of feminine power and agency in traditional Hawaiian society.

• The setting of the narrative in the area of Honouliuli and Keahumoa provides historical and cultural context.
  – Honouliuli, a region known for its fishing grounds, may symbolize a space of abundance and fertility, contrasting with the challenges and hardships faced by the characters.
  – Keahumoa, as a geographical location, might represent a transitional or liminal space, given its association with the plains and the movement of people between different areas (c.f., Kirch, 2010).
  – The mention of these locations could also allude to the post-contact period's impact on traditional Hawaiian territorial divisions and the reorganization of land use, reflecting broader themes of social change and cultural resilience.

• The narrative's focus on desire, marriage, and childbirth can be seen as a reflection of social commentary on the changing values and norms of the time.
  – The conversation between Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī might critique the objectification of women's bodies and the disregard for their autonomy in the face of patriarchal desires, echoing the sentiments of scholars like Lilikalā Kame‘eleihiwa (1999).
  – Furthermore, the ease with which Puali‘i dismisses Pōka‘ī's concerns about her recent childbirth may symbolize the disrespect for traditional Hawaiian practices and values, such as the Kapu o ka ‘Īlonā, which emphasized the importance of postpartum care and separation (Handy & Pukui, 1958).","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

When the sweet potatoes were ready, Puali‘i said in his promise, ""When the head of the ulua fish and the sweet potato are cooked, then Puali‘i will eat, and afterwards, his wife Pōka‘ī and the others will eat."" Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the sea of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with the sweet potatoes.","• The passage describes Puali‘i's life as a farmer and fisherman, highlighting his connection to the land and the sea.
  – This reflects the traditional Hawaiian emphasis on living in harmony with nature and relying on the land and sea for sustenance (Malolo, 1951).
  – The mention of sweet potato fields and fishing also points to the importance of agriculture and marine resources in pre-contact Hawaiian subsistence practices.

• The name Nāmakaokapāo‘o can be broken down into Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, which roughly translates to ""the eyes of the shark"" or ""the shark's gaze"".
  – This name may symbolize the protection and provision that the land and sea offer to Puali‘i and his family, as sharks were considered ‘aumākua (ancestral spirits) in Hawaiian culture (Beckwith, 1970).
  – The name may also allude to the concept of mana (spiritual power) and the connection between the natural world and human well-being.

• The character of Puali‘i and his actions can be seen as an allegory for the traditional Hawaiian values of hard work, self-sufficiency, and community sharing.
  – Puali‘i's promise to eat only after the sweet potatoes and fish are prepared suggests a sense of responsibility and stewardship towards his family and community (Kame‘eleihiwa, 1992).
  – The fact that he goes fishing to supplement their food supply also highlights the importance of cooperation and reciprocity between humans and the natural environment.

• The passage may also reflect social commentary on the changing times and the impact of post-contact influences on traditional Hawaiian practices.
  – The fact that the sweet potato fields have been left untouched ""to this day"" may suggest a sense of nostalgia or loss for the past, potentially alluding to the disruptions caused by the 1819 abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu era and the subsequent introduction of Western practices (Davenport, 1994).
  – The narrative may be critiquing the decline of traditional subsistence practices and the erosion of cultural values in the face of colonialism and modernization.

• The use of numerical symbolism and riddles in the passage is notable, particularly in the phrase ""‘elua āna mau māla ‘uala"" (two large sweet potato fields).
  – The number two may represent balance, reciprocity, or duality, echoing the concept of aloha ‘āina (love for the land) and the interdependence between humans and the natural world (McGregor, 2007).
  – The riddle-like quality of Puali‘i's promise may also suggest a deeper, spiritual significance to the narrative, inviting the reader to interpret the story on multiple levels.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p5,1,5,"A hala ‘o Puali‘i i ka lawai‘a, i ia wā ‘o   Nāmakaokapāo‘o i hele ai me nā keiki he ‘umi  kumamāhiku i nā māla ‘uala a Puali‘i. ‘O ke kino o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ia wā, he kino ‘u‘uku loa, ‘elua  kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e, ‘a‘ole i pa‘a kona  ma‘i, e lewalewa ana nō.

Nāmakaokapāo‘o's body at that time was very small, with two protruding breasts and a bent back, and his illness was not healed, he was limping. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the children, ""Remove all the leaves and vines from the top, don't leave any growing."" But the children were stubborn, so they just casually pulled on the sweet potatoes, without removing the leaves.","• The narrative may be seen as an allegory for the challenges faced by the Hawaiian people during the post-contact era, particularly after the 1819 abandonment of the 'Ai Kapu system and the subsequent influence of Western customs and Christianity.
  – The character of Puali‘i, who goes fishing, may represent the traditional Hawaiian way of life, which is being disrupted by external factors, as symbolized by Nāmakaokapāo‘o's illness and physical deformities.
  – The sweet potato patch, a staple crop in Hawaiian agriculture, serves as a backdrop for exploring the tensions between traditional practices and the introduction of new ideas and values.

• The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its etymological components: Nā- (the, plural article), maka (eyes), o (of, belonging to), ka (the, singular article), pāo'o (bulging, protruding).
  – This name may symbolize the all-seeing eye or the guardian of tradition, highlighting the importance of cultural knowledge and practices in the face of change.
  – The character's physical appearance, with two protruding breasts and a bent back, could represent the distortions and challenges that Hawaiian culture faced during this period of transition.

• The instruction to remove all leaves and vines from the sweet potatoes may be seen as a metaphor for the attempts to eradicate traditional Hawaiian practices and replace them with Western customs.
  – The children's refusal to follow Nāmakaokapāo‘o's instructions could symbolize the resistance of the Hawaiian people to the imposition of foreign values and the desire to maintain their cultural heritage.
  – This narrative may also reflect the social commentary on the Missionary influence, which started in 1820, and the impact it had on the traditional Hawaiian way of life, as noted by scholars such as Lilikalā Kame‘eleihiwa (1992) and Jonathan Osorio (2002).

• The use of numerical symbolism, such as the emphasis on removing all leaves and vines, may be significant in Hawaiian cultural context, where numbers often held spiritual and cosmological importance.
  – The number two, represented by Nāmakaokapāo‘o's two protruding breasts, could signify balance, duality, or the connection between the physical and spiritual realms.
  – Further analysis of numerical symbolism and its connection to broader Hawaiian cultural concepts, such as the Kumulipo creation chant, could provide deeper insights into the narrative's meaning and significance.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then, Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to her brother Puali‘i and said, ""I've cooked some sweet potatoes."" While she was saying this, her father, a rat, came and asked her mother, Pōka‘ī: ""Shall we eat them?"" Pōka‘ī replied: ""No."" But Puali‘i said: ""Yes, the head and eyes of the sweet potato are what I'm concerned about today, for they resemble my own head and eyes, and that's why I will die.""","• The passage presents an allegorical representation of conflict and power dynamics within a family, reflective of broader societal changes during the post-contact period in Hawaii.
  – The character of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, whose name breaks down into Nā-maka-o-ka-pā-o'o, can be interpreted as a symbol of transformative power, with ""nā"" indicating plurality, ""maka"" signifying eyes or face, ""o"" being a possessive article, ""ka"" denoting a definite article, ""pā"" implying a wall or enclosure, and ""o'o"" meaning a heap or pile.
  – This name may represent the ability to see beyond boundaries or to bring about change by piling or accumulating knowledge, reflecting the cultural significance of vision and insight in Hawaiian epistemology (Kame'eleihiwa, 1992).

• The act of cooking sweet potatoes and the reaction of the characters to them holds significant cultural and symbolic meaning.
  – The sweet potato, or 'uala, was a staple crop in ancient Hawaii, representing sustenance and nourishment (Handy, 1940). The act of cooking and consuming 'uala may symbolize the digestion and integration of new ideas or influences, reflecting the cultural transitions of the post-1820 missionary era.
  – Puali‘i's statement about the head and eyes of the sweet potato resembling his own may allude to the fear of being consumed or supplanted by external forces, echoing the anxieties of the Hawaiian people during the period of rapid cultural change.

• The character of Pōka‘ī and her response to the offer of food provide insight into the societal values and power dynamics at play.
  – Pōka‘ī's name, breaking down into Pō-ka-‘ī, may signify a connection to the night (pō) and a possessive or relational aspect (ka), with ""‘ī"" possibly implying a leader or chief (Elbert, 1986). Her refusal to eat the sweet potatoes may represent a symbolic resistance to external influences or a desire to maintain traditional practices.
  – The exchange between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i may also reflect the tensions between traditional authority and the emerging influence of foreign ideas, highlighting the complexities of cultural navigation during the 19th century.

• The narrative may be seen as a reflection of social commentary on the impact of colonialism and foreign influence on Hawaiian society.
  – The character of the rat, Puali‘i's father, may symbolize the perceived invasive or disruptive nature of external forces, echoing the Hawaiian concept of ""ma'i 'oko'a,"" or foreign diseases, which were seen as a result of foreign contamination (Sahlins, 1981).
  – The passage as a whole may be interpreted as a warning or commentary on the dangers of unchecked external influence, highlighting the need for cultural preservation and resilience in the face of colonialism and cultural imperialism.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw and ran to the place and stood before Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Here is the axe in my hand, to cut your head off today, and your head will be cooked with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat first, and then it will be free."" Nāmakaokapāo'o did not listen to Puali'i's words, and Puali'i spoke again, of the pit. Puali'i was ready to kill Nāmakaokapāo'o with the axe, at the time when Nāmakaokapāo'o was praying his death prayer for Puali'i. The prayer was as follows: My dear Nākukui'aimakaokalani, who is Kukui'aimakaokalani, my lover, and Nāmakaokai'a, the great chief of Hawai'i, let the anger go, let the foolishness go, a person with a spear, a spear with a drum, death to Nāmakaokapāo'o.","• The narrative presents a confrontation between Puali'i and Nāmakaokapāo'o, symbolizing the clash between traditional Hawaiian values and the influence of external forces.
  – This confrontation can be seen as a representation of the cultural transitions occurring during the post-1820 missionary influence period, where traditional practices and beliefs were being challenged by new ideologies.
  – The character of Puali'i, wielding an axe, may represent the disruptive force of change, while Nāmakaokapāo'o, cooking sweet potatoes, embodies the traditional and nurturing aspects of Hawaiian culture.

• The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pā-o'o can be broken down to reveal its symbolic meaning.
  – Nā- refers to the possessive article, indicating a connection to the gods or the divine.
  – Maka- means ""eye"" or ""face,"" representing insight, wisdom, or spiritual connection.
  – O- is a possessive article, indicating a relationship or connection.
  – Ka- is an article used to indicate a noun or a concept.
  – Pā-o'o refers to a type of spirit or ghost, often associated with the ancestors or the afterlife.
  – The name Nāmakaokapāo'o may therefore signify a connection to the spiritual realm, ancestral wisdom, or the afterlife.

• The prayer spoken by Nāmakaokapāo'o contains significant cultural and historical references.
  – The mention of Nā-maka-o-kai-'a, the great chief of Hawai'i, may refer to a historical figure or a symbolic representation of Hawaiian leadership and authority.
  – The phrase ""let the anger go, let the foolishness go"" may be seen as a call for balance, harmony, and the resolution of conflicts, reflecting the importance of maintaining social equilibrium in traditional Hawaiian society.
  – The image of ""a person with a spear, a spear with a drum"" may symbolize the connection between warfare, music, and spiritual practices, highlighting the complexities of Hawaiian cultural expressions.

• The use of numerical symbolism, such as the four sweet potatoes, may hold significance in the narrative.
  – The number four is often associated with the four cardinal directions, the four seasons, or the four stages of life, representing balance, harmony, and completeness.
  – The cooking of four sweet potatoes may symbolize the nourishment and sustenance of the community, as well as the importance of sharing and reciprocity in traditional Hawaiian culture.

• The narrative may be seen as a reflection of social commentary or critique, particularly in regards to the impact of external influences on traditional Hawaiian society.
  – The character of Puali'i, with his axe and destructive intentions, may represent the disruptive force of colonialism or missionary influence, which threatened the traditional ways of life and cultural practices.
  – The prayer spoken by Nāmakaokapāo'o, with its emphasis on balance, harmony, and the resolution of conflicts, may be seen as a call for resistance against the erosive forces of change and a plea for the preservation of traditional values and cultural identity.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","And thus the story tells of those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, who were both high chiefs of Hawai‘i, with Nāmakaokalani being the father and Nāmakaokai‘a the child, but they were included within the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","• The narrative introduction of Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a as high chiefs of Hawai‘i sets the stage for an exploration of traditional Hawaiian leadership and societal structures.
  – This reflects the importance of ali‘i (chiefs) in pre-contact Hawaiian society, especially during the 'Ai Kapu era, where social hierarchy was strictly defined.
  – The father-child relationship between Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a may symbolize the transmission of power, knowledge, and cultural values across generations, a theme crucial in Hawaiian cultural continuity.

• The character names Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a offer insights into their roles and the narrative's deeper meanings.
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-lani can be broken down into ""the-eyes-of-the-heaven"" or ""the one who sees from the heavens,"" suggesting a connection to the divine or a high level of spiritual insight.
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a translates to ""the-eyes-of-the-fish"" or metaphorically, ""the one who sees from the perspective of abundance,"" indicating fertility and provision, possibly referencing the sea's bounty.
  – These names may allegorically represent the balance between spiritual leadership (Nāmakaokalani) and the management of natural resources (Nāmakaokai‘a), essential for the well-being of Hawaiian communities.

• The inclusion of these characters within the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o hints at a broader spiritual or ceremonial context.
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, meaning ""the-eyes-of-the-night"" or ""the one who sees in the darkness,"" implies a connection to the mysterious, the underworld, or the afterlife, suggesting a narrative that explores themes of life, death, and the spiritual realm.
  – This could reference the post-1819 period, following the abolition of the 'Ai Kapu system, where traditional Hawaiian religious practices were undergoing significant changes, and the narrative might be reflecting on these transitions.
  – The prayer (pule) context also points to the importance of spiritual practice and ritual in Hawaiian daily life, especially in times of change or conflict, underscoring the resilience and adaptability of Hawaiian spiritual traditions.

• The narrative's structure and character introductions may serve as social commentary on the preservation of traditional knowledge and power structures in the face of external influences.
  – The mention of specific chiefs and their lineage may critique the post-1820 missionary influence, which significantly altered Hawaiian social structures and governance.
  – By focusing on the father-child relationship and the inclusion within a prayer, the narrative might emphasize the importance of preserving cultural heritage and traditional forms of leadership and spirituality, reflecting a concern for cultural continuity in a period of rapid change.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p9,1,9,"A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o, i ia wā i  ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o, e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i  iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē.

Puali‘i's head was presented to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, saying: ""Aloha, Nāmakaokapāo‘o."" Nāmakaokapāo‘o threw Puali‘i's head into the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the coast of Honouliuli, and it was five miles long.","• The violent act of Puali‘i striking Nāmakaokapāo‘o with a stone adze can be interpreted as a symbolic representation of the clash between traditional Hawaiian spiritual practices and the incoming influences of foreign cultures, particularly in the post-1820 missionary era.
  – This period saw significant changes in Hawaiian society, including the abandonment of traditional practices and the adoption of Christian values, which may be reflected in the narrative's depiction of violence and conflict (as noted by historian Lilikalā Kame‘eleihiwa, 1992).
  – The use of a stone adze, a traditional Hawaiian tool, may also represent the disruption of native cultural practices and the imposition of foreign systems.

• The character name Nāmakaokapāo‘o can be broken down into its etymological components: Nā-maka-o-ka-pā-o‘o, which roughly translates to ""the eyes of the shark's mouth"" or ""the gaze of the shark's jaws.""
  – This name may symbolize the sharp, piercing insight or the fierce protective nature associated with sharks in Hawaiian culture, highlighting Nāmakaokapāo‘o's role as a guardian or defender of traditional practices.
  – The shark (manō) is also a significant figure in Hawaiian mythology, often representing adaptability, resilience, and spiritual power (as discussed by anthropologist Katharine Luomala, 1955).

• The measurement of five miles (‘elima mile) for the length of the cave or the distance thrown may hold numerical symbolism, as the number five is often associated with balance, harmony, and the connection between the physical and spiritual realms in Hawaiian cultural contexts.
  – In traditional Hawaiian thought, numbers and measurements can convey deeper meanings and spiritual significance, reflecting the intricate balance and interconnectedness of the natural and spiritual worlds (as explained by cultural expert Mary Kawena Pukui, 1983).
  – This numerical detail might also allude to the narrative's themes of balance, reciprocity, and the restoration of harmony in the face of conflict and disruption.

• The narrative may reflect social commentary on the power dynamics and cultural clashes that occurred during Hawaii's historical transition periods, such as the 'Ai Kapu era and the post-contact era.
  – The story could be seen as a critique of the violence and disruption caused by foreign influences, as well as a reflection of the native Hawaiian struggle to maintain cultural identity and traditions in the face of overwhelming external pressures.
  – As historian Noenoe K. Silva notes (2004), Hawaiian narratives often employ allegory and symbolism to comment on historical events and cultural transformations, making them rich sources for understanding the complexities of Hawaiian history and cultural identity.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

There's a small, very strong child, whose father died and whose head was chopped off and thrown into the sea, a very deep place, five miles deep. ‘Ama‘u listened, and he was strong and died because of it, but if he hadn't died, he wouldn't have been strong. While speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words.","This passage introduces key characters and events that may symbolize the cultural and social upheaval during the early 19th century in Hawai‘i, particularly the shift from the traditional 'Ai Kapu era to the post-1820 missionary influence period.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat.

The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.
