• This opening follows the classic Hawaiian mo'olelo (story) structure by establishing:
– **a)** The protagonist's physical attributes (size/strength) and superlative qualities (having ""no equal"")
– **b)** Genealogical connections through:
  – **b1)** Father's lineage (Kauluakaha'i) with divine affiliation ('ao'ao akua)
  – **b2)** Mother's identity (Pōka'ī)
– **c)** Geographical origins (Kahikipapaialewa, Kahikinu'u)

**Name Etymologies & Symbolism:**
• **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** (The-eyes-of-the-[pāo'o]-fish):
– Pāo'o (Blennies marine fish) symbolize resilience in Hawaiian tradition (thrive in tidal zones)
– Eyes (nā maka) represent perception/awareness, foreshadowing protagonist's future deeds
– Name construction mirrors demigod naming patterns (cf. Nā-maka-o-Kaha'i)

• **Ka-ulu-a-Kaha'i** (The-inspiration-of-Kaha'i):
– Connects to the Kaha'i epic cycle (breadfruit bringer)
– Genealogical claim to divine heritage through Kaha'i tradition (HM 97, HM 248)

• **Pō-ka-'ī** (Night-of-the-high-chief):
– ""Pō"" references the creative night of Kū (Pukui 1983: po'ele)
– Name suggests aristocratic lineage through 'ī (high-born)

**Cultural Context:**
• The triad declaration of ""no equal"" ('a'ohe ona lua) follows the:
– **1)** Size paradox ('u'uku/ikaika): Common motif in mo'olelo for extraordinary beings (cf. Māui)
– **2)** Geographic scope (Hawai'i-Ni'ihau): Standard formula for total dominion (cf. Kamapua'a traditions)
– **3)** Dual supremacy: Physical (strength) and spiritual (bravery) excellence

• Kahiki references:
– **Kahiki-papa-ia-lewa** (Kahiki stratum in the heavens):
   – Suggests celestial origins (cf. Luanu'u migration traditions)
– **Kahiki-nu'u** (Elevated Kahiki):
   – Reinforces ancestral connections to Polynesian homelands

**Theological Implications:**
• The ""ao'ao akua"" (divine portion) attribution:
– Reflects the Hawaiian concept of hybrid divinity (kino lau)
– Parallels other heroic genealogies (e.g., Hina-Kea lineage)
– Establishes mana basis for subsequent narrative actions

**Comparative Motifs:**
• The father's divine connection (Kauluakaha'i) vs. mortal mother (Pōka'ī):
– Repeats the common demi-god birth pattern (cf. Pele-Hi'iaka saga)
– Creates tension between earthly and divine responsibilities

• Size-strength paradox anticipates later narrative developments regarding:
– 'Ai Kapu subversion (as seen in destruction of 'uala patches)
– Traditional hierarchy challenges (cf. analysis in Example 3)","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97).

See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","**Chapter Summary: Nāmakaokapāo‘o and the Politics of Strength in Hawaiian Oral Tradition**  

The opening chapter of this narrative establishes Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a divine-archetypal hero whose supernatural strength and diminutive size embody contradictions central to Hawaiian conceptions of power—physical prowess coupled with social vulnerability. His lineage is deliberately framed through both aristocratic (his father Kauluakaha‘i as a ""high chief of Kahikipapaialewa"") and divine parentage, a trope common in Hawaiian moʻolelo where heroic figures bridge human and celestial realms. Meanwhile, his mother Pōka‘ī is rendered passive and impoverished, reflecting gendered portrayals of Hawaiian women in 19th-century literature as dependent on male agency, whether through Kauluakaha‘i’s abandonment or Puali‘i’s objectification (""let us sleep together"").  

The geographic specificity of Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa and the sweet potato fields of Keahumoa anchors the story in western Oʻahu, a region historically contested among Oʻahu chiefs. The naming of the fields after Nāmakaokapāo‘o suggests an etiological function—this moʻolelo may have served to explain place names tied to agricultural labor and chiefly authority. Notably, Puali‘i’s enforcement of a modified kapu system (eating ulua fish heads before others may eat) mirrors pre-1819 Hawaiian religious structures, yet his arbitrary violence—and ultimate beheading—subverts traditional chiefly legitimacy, framing him as a tyrannical counterpoint to Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s destined rule.  

Thematically, the chapter critiques unchecked authority through Puali‘i’s downfall and ‘Ama‘u’s failed conquests. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s victory over ‘Ama‘u’s 192 warriors (divided into four emblematic war parties) employs symbolic numerology (four groups, eight climbers) common in Hawaiian battle narratives. His hiding atop the ridgepole—a liminal space between heaven and earth—reinforces his role as an intermediary between divine justice and human governance. The prayer invoking Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a further ties him to chiefly genealogies while weaponizing oli as spiritual warfare.  

Historically, this chapter’s publication context (likely late 19th century) warrants scrutiny. The emphasis on a small-bodied hero overthrowing multiple oppressive forces may allegorize Hawaiian resistance to colonial displacement. The decapitation motif, paired with Puali‘i’s head speaking posthumously, echoes indigenous critiques of foreign authority—a subversive commentary on the destabilization of Hawaiian governance post-1893. The systematic dismantling of ‘Ama‘u’s forces (first warriors, then the chief himself) mirrors the strategic resistance of Hawaiian nationalists, with Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s final consolidation of Oʻahu mirroring desires for unified sovereignty.  

Culturally, this narrative negotiates tensions between traditional heroism and post-contact realities. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s refusal to eat after Puali‘i’s death signals ceremonial mourning (ʻai kapu protocols), yet his ultimate dominance reflects a shift toward individualistic leadership models. The moʻolelo’s persistence in Hawaiian newspapers during the Annexation era (notably *Ka Nūpepa Kūʻokoʻa*) suggests its utility as both a morale-building allegory and a covert resistance text, reasserting Hawaiian agency through the lens of ʻōlelo kahiko (traditional oral narrative)."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

When Pōka‘ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Kauluakaha‘i returned to his own land, while Pōka‘ī remained with her pregnancy until eventually giving birth. At this birth, Pōka‘ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were left in great poverty.""","**Paragraph Analysis:**
• **Geographical Context:**  
– The place name ""Hō‘ae‘ae"" (meaning ‘to copulate’ or ‘to throw repeatedly’) in ‘Ewa (a western district of O‘ahu) carries symbolic weight. ‘Ewa was historically significant for its fertile lands and ceremonial importance. The name’s sexual connotation foreshadows Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s conception while grounding the story in a specific cultural landscape.  
– ""Launa kino"" (physical union) is a euphemistic Hawaiian phrase for sexual intercourse, often used in traditional narratives to describe conception with discretion and respect. This reflects the Hawaiian value of *kūpono* (propriety) in storytelling.

• **Genealogical and Social Dynamics:**  
– The passage follows classic Hawaiian storytelling structure by noting conception (""moe ‘ana iho"" – literally, ‘lying down’), pregnancy (""hāpai""), and birth (""hānau""). These terms align with ‘Ai Kapu-era norms where procreation was tied to lineage (*mo‘okū‘auhau*) and land stewardship.  
– Kauluakaha‘i’s departure mirrors Polynesian voyaging tropes where high-ranking fathers (here, a chief/demigod from the foreign land Kahikipapaialewa) leave after conception, leaving the mother to raise extraordinary children (compare with Maui legends).  
– Pōka‘ī’s impoverishment (""‘ilihune loa"") post-birth may symbolically critique the ‘Ai Kapu system’s rigid gender roles, where women bore economic burdens of single parenthood while men retained chiefly status.

• **Names and Symbolism:**  
– ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o"" (The eyes of the pāo‘o fish):  
  * The *pāo‘o* (a blenny fish) was culturally associated with resilience (able to survive in tidal pools) and perceptiveness (large eyes). This foreshadows the child’s future as a keen, disruptive force.  
  * The name’s reference to ""eyes"" (*maka*) may also hint at his role as a witness to or challenger of societal norms, later echoed in his destruction of sweet potato patches (as noted in your Example 3).  
– ""Pō-ka-‘ī"" (Night falls upon the high chief):  
  * The name’s darkness symbolism (""Pō"") could reflect her marginalized status post-kaikua‘ana (elder sibling) conception norms, where secondary unions often left women vulnerable.  
  * The truncation ""-‘ī"" (high chief) may ironically contrast her eventual poverty, critiquing chiefly abandonment.

• **Cultural Allegory:**  
– The impoverished birth scene critiques the *mō‘ī* (paramount chief) system’s failures, where divine lineage (via Kauluakaha‘i) did not guarantee maternal support.  
– The juxtaposition of Pōka‘ī’s suffering with her child’s powerful name suggests a generational tension: those who uphold tradition (Pōka‘ī’s acceptance of her fate) versus those who disrupt it (Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s later actions).  
– The setting of ‘Ewa (a region famed for its *lo‘i kalo* / taro patches) may foreshadow future agricultural destruction metaphors tied to ‘Ai Kapu reform.

**Historical Parallels:**  
This passage resonates with the *Mo‘olelo Kāne* tradition, where demigod offspring (e.g., Kamapua‘a) are born into hardship but later wield transformative power. Such narratives often mirrored real societal shifts, like the decline of ‘Ai Kapu post-contact.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puali'i responded: 'Those things don't matter, if you desire me, let us sleep together.' Pōka'ī consented. Then Pōka'ī went with her husband Puali'i to the plains of Keahumoa to live.""","**Cultural Context and Narrative Structure:**
• This passage exemplifies classic Hawaiian storytelling elements, where:  
   – Character introductions follow the traditional pattern of establishing genealogy and place (Puali'i from Līhu'e, arriving at Honouliuli)  
   – Dialogue serves as the primary vehicle for advancing both plot and relational dynamics  
   – The passage illustrates the Hawaiian concept of 'ohana (family) formation through informal but culturally significant agreements

**Character Analysis:**
• **Pua-(a)li'i (probably ""Flower/Offspring of a Chief""):**
   – Described positively as ""kanaka maika'i"" (good person), establishing his virtuous character  
   – His active pursuit (""makemake akula iā ia"") reflects traditional courtship patterns where men initiated relationships  
   – The fishing expedition (""lawai'a ma kai"") situates him as a provider, key to his marriageability  

• **Pō-ka-'ī (""Night of the High Chief""):**
   – Exhibits traditional female humility through self-deprecation about her postpartum body  
   – Her hesitant response carries deeper cultural meaning about:  
      ‣ Post-birth 'kapu' (taboos) regarding female purity  
      ‣ The traditional Hawaiian view that childbirth marked a woman's transition into full adulthood  

**Cultural Practices Revealed:**
• The casual proposal (""e moe kāua"") reflects the 'Ai Kapu era's practical approach to marriage:  
   – No formal ceremony required beyond mutual consent ('ae akula)  
   – Couples often began cohabiting immediately, as seen by their move to Keahumoa  

• Place name significance:  
   – **Hono-uli-uli (""Dark Bay"")**: A sacred fishing ground in 'Ewa district, symbolizing Puali'i's connection to bountiful resources  
   – **Ke-ahu-moa (""Chicken Mound"")**: May reference either agricultural prosperity (chickens as protein source) or religious significance (ahu as altar)  

**Symbolic Elements:**
• The sweet potato reference in Pōka'ī's response carries layered meaning:  
   – The 'uala (sweet potato) was both staple crop and fertility symbol  
   – Her self-comparison to an 'ino'ino (ruined) 'uala vine may represent:  
       -- Postpartum physical changes  
       -- Societal views on previously childbearing women  
       -- Contrast with virginal purity prized in some kapu traditions  

• The journey to Keahumoa mirrors:  
   – Traditional Hawaiian residential patterns where couples often relocated to the man's land  
   – The symbolic transition from coastal (fishing) to inland (agricultural) subsistence  

**Linguistic Notes:**
• The verb ""kipa"" (to visit) contains ceremonial nuance—not casual visiting but proper protocol when arriving at a dwelling  
• The phrase ""wahine na'u"" (woman for me) uses the possessive ""na"" form, indicating permanent relational claim rather than temporary arrangement  
• Pōka'ī's response uses the existential ""ua hānau wau"" construction, emphasizing her irreversible state as birth-giver, a point of both pride and perceived limitation in traditional society","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

There were two of his long sweet potato fields that remain to this day, and the name of these fields is called Nāmakaokapāo'o to this very day. When the sweet potatoes matured, Puali'i made his solemn vow: ""When the head of the ulua fish is baked with the sweet potatoes, and Puali'i eats, then the restriction is lifted, and his woman Pōka'ī and the others may eat."" Therefore, Puali'i went down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat together with the sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**
• This passage reveals several key elements of traditional Hawaiian agricultural practices and kapu (sacred prohibition) systems:
   – The reference to ""two long sweet potato fields"" (ʻelua mau māla ʻuala lōʻihi) carries potential numerological significance, as pairs often represent balance in Hawaiian thought (cf. Kāne-Kanaloa dualism in creation stories).
   – The naming of agricultural fields after individuals (ʻo Nāmakaokapāoʻo) reflects the Hawaiian concept of imbuing land with personal and ancestral mana - a practice documented in the 1880 Hawaiian Government Survey notes where patches were named after notable growers.

• The sacred meal protocol described shows strict ʻAi Kapu gender restrictions:
   – Pualiʻi's vow follows the classic structure of kapu-lifting rituals: a) sacred preparation (kālua cooking), b) sequential consumption (male first), c) declaration of noa (ʻfree from restrictionʼ).
   – The pairing of ulua head (poʻo o ka ulua) with ʻuala carries deep symbolism:
       * Ulua fish represented masculinity and chiefly status (as seen in ʻŌlelo Noʻeau 2932)
       * The ʻuala (sweet potato) was a female-associated crop (contrast with male-associated taro)
       * This forms a gender-complementary ritual meal, similar to ceremonial pairings at luakini temples

• The geographic movement patterns reflect traditional resource procurement:
   – Pualiʻi's journey from upland fields (where ʻuala grows best) to marine areas (Honouliuli) exemplifies the ahupuaʻa system of vertical resource access
   – The specific mention of Honouliuli (dark bay) in ʻEwa district connects to historical fishing grounds documented in Kepelino's Traditions of Hawaiʻi

• The passage preserves intact several linguistic features of late 18th century Oʻahu dialect:
   – Use of lōʻihi for ""long"" rather than lōa (more common today)
   – Retention of the causative hoʻohiki (to vow) showing classical verb morphology
   – The ritualized speech formula ""Aia ā...a laila"" follows patterns recorded in Malo's Hawaiian Antiquities Chapter 30

• Allegorical interpretations suggest this may encode agricultural cycles:
   – The two fields could represent wet/dry cultivation methods
   – The ulua-ʻuala pairing mirrors the makahiki cycle where ocean yields (fish) follow land yields (crops)
   – The kapu release after Pualiʻi eats may symbolize the opening of ʻuala harvest season

• The perpetuation of the name Nāmakaokapāoʻo to present day reflects:
   – The Hawaiian concept of pīʻāpā naming (binding names to places through use)
   – A possible reference to eye-shaped sweet potato tubers (maka=eyes, pāoʻo=fish) creating visual wordplay
   – The endurance of oral history in place names as noted in Kamakau's Tales and Traditions","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

When they reached those sweet potato patches, he commanded the children, 'Pull up the sweet potato plants with the vines until all are uprooted, don't leave any to keep growing.' But the children were afraid, so they worked gently on the sweet potatoes, not pulling up the plants.""","**Paragraph 5:**
• This passage continues the theme of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's destructive behavioral patterns first seen in the previous paragraph, now directed at his stepfather Pua-li'i's sweet potato fields. The description establishes three important details: 
– The exact number of companions (17 children) highlights the Hawaiian cultural significance of numbers in oral tradition (often carrying symbolic meaning)
– Precise physical description of the protagonist (""two feet and half his height"" with ""dangling"" genitals) follows classic Hawaiian storytelling conventions where heroes' unusual physical traits signify special status
– The agricultural sabotage reflects ancient conflicts between stepchildren and stepparents, a common motif in Hawaiian mo'olelo

• The sweet potato ('uala) destruction holds deeper cultural significance:
– As a staple crop, 'uala represented sustenance and productivity; its willful destruction would be shocking
– The command to pull up vines completely (""mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana"") suggests complete annihilation rather than harvest, symbolizing rebellion against the established order
– The children's fear mirrors societal reluctance to challenge existing power structures, even when commanded by an ali'i

• Important character insights through physical description:
– ""Elua kapua'i me ka hapa"" (literally ""two feet with half"") continues the pattern of emphasizing his small but powerful nature
– The dangling genitals (""aʻole i paʻa kona maʻi"") may symbolize:
   – His prepubescent status (contrasting with adult actions)
   – A challenge to traditional masculinity norms
   – A visual metaphor for his unpredictable, ""uncontained"" nature

• The number seventeen ('umi kumamāhiku) may carry esoteric meaning:
– In Hawaiian numerology, 10 + 7 could represent completeness (10) and spiritual power (7)
– Alternatively, may reference the seventeen districts of certain islands
– Could indicate the needed manpower for an important task

• This scene foreshadows later conflicts with:
– Food systems (connection to previous ulua scene)
– Authority figures (Puali'i as stepfather and land caretaker)
– Traditional agricultural practices (representing the old order)","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

So, today I will kill him.'""","**Paragraph 6:**

• **Symbolic Destruction of Cultivation:**  
– The passage opens with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's deliberate destruction of sweet potato (*'uala*) patches, a culturally significant act. Sweet potatoes were a staple crop in pre-contact Hawai'i, representing sustenance and abundance. The violent ""tearing apart"" (*huhuki*) suggests an intentional dismantling of established agricultural order.  
– The numerical symbolism (40 mounds from 2 patches) may reflect:  
  * An inversion of traditional cultivation practices (typically 4–5 mounds per patch).  
  * A coded reference to the 40 *akua* or godly manifestations in Hawaiian cosmology, linking the boy’s actions to divine intervention.  

• **Ritualistic Cooking Scene:**  
– The broiling (*'ōhinu*) of four sweet potato vines (*'ehā 'au*) carries layered meaning:  
  * The number 4 references the four main Hawaiian gods (Kāne, Kū, Lono, Kanaloa) or the four cardinal directions, embedding the act in sacred geography.  
  * Cooking vines (rather than tubers) may symbolize the destruction of potential future growth, as vines are used for propagation.  

• **Name Etymology and Foreshadowing:**  
– Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's name (""The eyes of the pāo'o fish"") becomes thematically crucial here. The threatened consumption of his ""eyes"" (*maka*) and head (*po'o*) echoes:  
  * **Cultural Practice:** In 'Ai Kapu tradition, eyes (*maka*) symbolized both physical sight and spiritual insight (*maka* also means ""face"" or ""presence""). Consuming them was taboo except in ceremonial contexts.  
  * **Wordplay:** *Pāo'o* (the fish) shares phonological roots with *po'o* (head), reinforcing the head/eye motif.  

• **Conflict as Allegory for Societal Change:**  
– Puali'i's threat to kill the boy while invoking sweet potatoes (*'uala*) and ulua symbolism (from Example 3's commentary) mirrors tensions between:  
  * **Old Order ('Ai Kapu):** Represented by Puali'i's adherence to strict protocols (e.g., ulua-as-sacrifice symbolism).  
  * **New Disorder:** Nāmakaokapāo'o's wanton destruction mirrors early 19th-century challenges to kapu systems, where traditional agriculture and religion were disrupted by foreign influence.  
– The stepfather's rage at uprooted *'uala* may critique the literal and figurative uprooting of Hawaiian lifeways during contact-era upheavals.  

• **Dialogue and Gender Dynamics:**  
– Pōka'ī's terse refusal (""'A'ole"") contrasts with Puali'i's gory declaration, highlighting:  
  * Maternal protection vs. paternal wrath, a common theme in Hawaiian *mo'olelo* (histories/stories).  
  * The tension between *kāne* (male authority) and *wahine* (female mediation) roles in domestic disputes.  

• **Numerology in Context:**  
– The repeated numbers (2 patches → 40 mounds; 4 vines) likely encode esoteric knowledge:  
  * 40 (*kanahā*) may reference the 40 days of mourning for high chiefs or the 40 winds of the *Kumulipo* creation chant.  
  * The pairing of 2 (dualities: land/sea, male/female) and 4 (completion) suggests cosmological balance disrupted by the boy's actions.  

• **Threat as Ritual Reversal:**  
– Puali'i's vow to eat Nāmakaokapāo'o's head/eyes with sweet potatoes perverts:  
  * **Normal 'Ai Kapu Practice:** Where ulua fish heads substituted for human sacrifice (see Example 3).  
  * **Agricultural Cycle:** Tubers (future sustenance) are replaced by human flesh (immediate violence), a grim parody of harvest rituals.  

**Allegorical Interpretation:**  
This passage critiques the overthrow of 'Ai Kapu through Nāmakaokapāo'o's destructive agency. His ruination of staple crops parallels historical abandonment of traditional food systems, while Puali'i's archaic threat represents futile resistance to change. The boy's name—linking eyes (*maka*, symbolic of perception) and fish (*pāo'o*, linked to heads/authority)—positions him as both destroyer and visionary.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches.

As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the other children saw and ran to stand at a distant place out of fear of Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Hey! Here is the machete in my hand, which will cut off your head today, and when your head is severed, then roasted with the sweet potatoes, I will eat first, and then it will be free."" Nāmakaokapāo'o paid no attention to these words of Puali'i, so Puali'i spoke again, this being the second time. Puali'i prepared to cut Nāmakaokapāo'o with the machete, and at that moment Nāmakaokapāo'o prayed his death prayer against Puali'i. The prayer went like this:  
*""Alas the eye of my little pāo'o,*  
*Gathering, hardening,*  
*Whether to eat or leave,*  
*Or leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,*  
*That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,*

*Nāmakaokai‘a, great chief of Hawai‘i,*  
*Slip away, slip away the worthless breath,*  
*Men with spears,*  
*Spears with shields,*  
*Death comes to Nāmakaokapāo'o.""*","**Paragraph 7:**
• This passage showcases a critical confrontation between Pua-li'i (stepfather) and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (stepson), steeped in cultural symbolism and esoteric meaning:  
– Pua-li'i's threat to behead Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and roast his head with sweet potatoes (*kālua*) mirrors ‘Ai Kapu-era practices where sacrificial offerings were cooked in imu (earth ovens). The phrase ""*a ‘ai iho a‘u ma mua, a laila, noa*"" (""I will eat first, then it will be free"") reflects the ‘Ai Kapu protocol where the highest-ranking individual ate first to render the food *noa* (free from restriction).  
– The machete (*ko‘ilipi*) symbolizes judicial authority and punitive violence, aligning with Pua-li'i’s role as an enforcer of traditional order. His threat inverts sacrificial norms—where ulua fish replaced humans—by proposing human sacrifice *for* food (sweet potato), a subversion of ‘Ai Kapu logic.  

• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s resistance is passive yet potent:  
– His disregard for Pua-li'i’s threats (*‘a‘ohe ho‘olohe*) suggests defiance of patriarchal authority, a theme recurring in Hawaiian mo‘olelo (histories) where youth challenge outdated customs.  
– His *pule make* (death prayer) is a poetic invocation of divine justice. The prayer’s structure follows traditional *oli kānaenae* (ritual chants), employing:  
  * Repetition (""e waiho paha"" / ""e he‘e lā"") for rhythmic emphasis.  
  * Name symbolism: Nā-kukui-‘ai-maka-o-ka-lani (""The-lights-that-feed-the-eyes-of-the-heavens"") and Kukui-‘ai-maka-o-ka-lani may reference ancestral protection or celestial observers.  
  * Wordplay: *pāo‘o* (his name’s suffix) phonetically resembles *po‘o* (""head""), tying to the beheading threat.  

• The final line’s paradoxical declaration—""*Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o*""—serves as a **kilio‘o** (prophetic twist):  
– Literally, it predicts Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s death, but allegorically foreshadows Pua-li'i’s demise, as later passages confirm. This reflects the Hawaiian concept of *kāpāwale* (hidden meanings in chants).  
– The chant’s reference to *ihe* (spears) and *pahu* (shields) militarizes the conflict, framing it as a battle between generational worldviews—‘Ai Kapu traditionalism (Pua-li'i) vs. post-contact adaptation (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o).  

• Cultural Context:  
– The sweet potato (*‘uala*) is not just food but a metaphor for fertility and lineage. Its destruction earlier (described in preceding paragraphs) and ritual use here symbolize the disruption and renewal of societal norms.  
– The children’s flight (*holo akula... no ka maka‘u*) mirrors historical accounts of commoners avoiding chiefly disputes, emphasizing the scene’s gravity.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","""Here we will briefly discuss those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, who were high chiefs of Hawai‘i, with Nāmakaokalani being the father and Nāmakaokai‘a the child, but they were absorbed into Nāmakaokapāo‘o's prayers.""","**Paragraph 8:**
• The passage provides an important lineage note about two chiefly figures (ali'i nui) who share similar naming patterns with the protagonist Nāmakaokapāo‘o. This establishes them as ancestral/parallel figures within the narrative's genealogical framework.  
– The names follow a sacred naming convention (kao) where divine/chiefly power is emphasized through the prefix ""Nā-maka-o-"" (the eyes of). This prefix connects all three names (Nā-maka-o-ka-lani, Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o) to vision, perception, or spiritual authority.
– Breaking down the names:
  1) **Nā-maka-o-ka-lani** (The eyes of the heavens/skies): Refers to celestial authority, possibly a deified ancestor. The inclusion of *lani* (heavens) suggests a connection to cosmogonic forces, similar to sky father deities like Wākea.  
  2) **Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a** (The eyes of the fish): Indicates marine/ecological mana. The suffix *i‘a* (fish) ties to Kanaloa, god of the ocean, and may symbolize navigation or abundance traditions.  

• The father-child dynamic mirrors Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s own lineage (as previously established with Kauluakaha‘i and Pōka‘ī). This structural repetition reinforces Hawaiian storytelling’s emphasis on *mo‘okū‘auhau* (genealogy) as narrative scaffolding.  

• The phrase ""komo i loko o ka pule"" (absorbed into the prayers) is ritually significant:  
– In pre-contact Hawai‘i, oral traditions often formalized relationships between past and present chiefly lines through *pule* (prayers/chants). This act symbolically merges ancestral mana with the protagonist’s spiritual practice.  
– The verb *komo* (to enter/penetrate) implies an active, physical incorporation—perhaps reflecting the concept of *unihipili* (spiritual inheritance), where ancestral essences inhabit living descendants via ritual.  

• Historically, this passage may reference the consolidation of chiefly power during the ‘Ai Kapu era:  
– The absorption of other chiefly lines (here through *pule*) parallels political strategies where rival ali‘i were neutralized through marriage, warfare, or—as here—cosmological narrative subsumption.  
– The focus on *nā maka* (eyes) in all three names may metaphorize surveillance/supernatural oversight, critical for maintaining kapu systems. The ""eyes"" could represent both literal kin (descendants watching ancestors) and symbolic divine witness (as with the gods observing human compliance with kapu).","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The severed head of Puali'i responded to Nāmakaokapāo'o: ""Farewell to you, Nāmakaokapāo'o."" Nāmakaokapāo'o grabbed Puali'i's head and threw it into the sea at Waipōuli, a cave along the shore of Honouliuli—its length being five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**
• This passage presents a critical moment of ritual and supernatural transformation, characteristic of Hawaiian mo'olelo where the boundaries between physical and spiritual realms blur. Key symbolic elements deserve close analysis:

– **Ritual Context of Beheading:** 
   The sequence begins with Nāmakaokapāo'o concluding prayer (pule), suggesting this act occurs within a sacred framework. In 'Ai Kapu traditions, beheading (moku ke po'o) often symbolized the transfer of mana or the severing of oppressive systems. Puali'i's attempt to strike with a ko'i (adze)—a tool used in creation/destruction duality—backfires allegorically, representing the overthrow of outdated authority.

– **Talking Head Motif (Po'o 'Ōlelo):** 
   The animate disembodied head is a powerful motif in Polynesian narratives (cf. the story of Kū-ali'i). Puali'i's head bidding farewell suggests:
   a) The persistence of ancestor communication ('ūmaiā) 
   b) A cultural acknowledgment of cyclic death/rebirth (cf. the cave as womb symbol, analyzed below)
   The greeting ""Aloha 'oe"" from a severed head merges the concepts of aloha (compassion) and make (death), embodying Hawaiian spiritual paradox.

– **Geographic Symbolism:**
   Waipōuli (Dark-Water) and Honouliuli (Dark-Bay) contain layered meanings:
   • Waipōuli's cave length (5 miles) numerically references the Hawaiian cosmological number for transformation (cf. 5 elements in creation chants)
   • The watery destination (kai) signifies a return to primordial chaos (Kumulipo imagery), appropriate for recycling a punitive figure like Puali'i

– **Etymological Resonance:**
   Nāmakaokapāo'o's name (Eyes-of-the-pāo'o-fish) gains new significance here. The pāo'o fish (a blind goby) symbolizes:
   a) Hidden wisdom (inability to see physical world but perceive spiritual truths) 
   b) Adaptation (pāo'o species survive in both saltwater and freshwater)—paralleling the protagonist's fluid navigation between physical and supernatural realms

• **Structural Analysis:**
  This passage exemplifies the Hawaiian narrative pattern of: 
  1) Ritual preparation (pule)
  2) Failed violent act (ko'i stroke) 
  3) Supernatural inversion (animate head)
  4) Geographic resolution (ocean deposition)
  This structure mirrors the classic four-phase Hawaiian ritual sequence observed in heiau ceremonies.

• **Cultural Transition Symbolism:**
  The beheading scene metaphorically represents:
  – The end of Puali'i's 'Ai Kapu mentality (his head literally separated from body/mind duality)
  – Nāmakaokapāo'o's progressive ideology physically discarding the old order (throwing head to sea)
  – The cave's five-mile length may numerically encode the five generations needed for societal change in Hawaiian oral histories","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
