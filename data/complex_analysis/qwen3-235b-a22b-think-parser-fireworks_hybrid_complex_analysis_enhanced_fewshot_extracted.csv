There was no equal to him across the islands from Hawaiʻi to Niʻihau for his small size and unmatched courage. His father was Kauluakahaʻi, from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinuʻu. His mother was Pōkaʻi. His father, Kauluakahaʻi, was a great chief of Kahikipapaialewa and a demigod by birth.","**Paragraph 1:**  
• This iconic opening establishes the foundational elements of Hawaiian narrative structure:  
 – **a) Introduction of the protagonist**:  
  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo (""the eyes of the pāoʻo fish"") is etymologically linked to marine imagery—**pāoʻo** (small fish) mirrors his diminutive stature, while **maka** (eyes) suggests penetrating spiritual insight, a common trope for seers or demigods (cf. Namaka, the ocean deity with prophetic vision).  
  • His paradoxical traits—**ʻuʻuku loa** (extremely small) and **ikaika loa** (incredibly strong)—echo traditional heroic archetypes where physical size contrasts with metaphysical power, akin to Māui and Kāneapua.  
  • The geographic scope **""mai Hawaiʻi ā Niʻihau""** (from Hawaiʻi to Niʻihau) emphasizes his legendary status even in childhood, as Niʻihau was culturally perceived as the westernmost extreme of the known world.  
 – **b1) Paternal lineage and identity**:  
  • **Kau-lu-a-Kahaʻi** (The Gatherer of Kahaʻi) references the mythical Polynesian hero Kahaʻi (Pukui & Elbert 1986:385), a Samoan voyager who imported breadfruit to Oʻahu. The prefix **Kaulu** (to gather, assemble) implies leadership and the compilation of mana (divine power); his name positions Nāmakaokapāoʻo as a cultural heir to Kahaʻi’s transformative voyages and agricultural legacy.  
  • **Kahiki-papa-ia-lewa** (""Kahiki upon the suspended platform"") locates his father’s realm in the celestial/mystical Kahiki (foreign homeland associated with ancestral spirits), contrasting with **Kahiki-nuʻu** (""Kahiki-at-the-summit"") in line c. This duality may reflect a stratified cosmology where sacred rulership resided in ""suspended"" spiritual domains yet governed earthly lands.  
 – **b2-c) Maternal and nobility dynamics**:  
  • **Pō-kaʻi** (""Guided by Night"") invokes lunar symbolism—a common motif for aliʻi (chiefs) with divine lineage, as the moon was believed to guide souls and pregnancies. Her name may also allude to the **Pō** (spirit world) and **kaʻi** (transport), hinting at her role as a bridge between earthly and ancestral realms.  
  • The clarification that Kauluakahaʻi is both a **aliʻi nui** (high chief) *and* **ʻaoʻao akua** (part god) follows genealogical conventions where supreme aliʻi were born from unions with akua (deities). This dual status aligns with the **kapu system** (1779–1819), where divine right justified chieftainship.  
• Subtle allegorical contrasts emerge:  
 – Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s name (marine eyes + small fish) juxtaposes **ʻike kupuna** (ancestral knowledge) with **kanu o ka hana** (fruit of labor), presaging his role in agricultural myths (e.g., destruction of kalo patches).  
 – The father’s dual titles (Kahikipapaialewa as celestial realm vs. Kahikinuʻu as earthly location) mirror the **nāu a pē** (floating and anchoring) duality in Hawaiian cosmology, suggesting Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s future role as a disruptor of rigid hierarchical systems like **ʻai kapu** (segregated eating laws).","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This chapter establishes foundational motifs of divine authority, intergenerational conflict, and the symbolic violence of land and lineage, all instrumental in both pre-colonial Hawaiian literary traditions and their politicized reinterpretation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The narrative centers on **Nāmakaokapāoʻo**, a demigod protagonist of paradoxical physical frailty and supernatural potency, who embodies the duality of vulnerability and destructive power embedded in kanaka Maoli cosmology. His origins in **Hōʻaeʻae** in ʻEwa—later conflated with the **Keahumoa sweet potato patches** on Oʻahu—anchor the story in contested political landscapes. Notably, Keahumoa in Līhuʻe (referenced earlier in the 19th-century lore) resurfaces here as a site of both agricultural sustenance and violent reclamation, mirroring historical tensions over land tenure and cultural sovereignty.  

The allegorical structure crystallizes in the conflict between **Pualiʻi**, an intrusive commoner, and Nāmakaokapāoʻo, the demigod heir. Pualiʻi’s attempt to absorb Pōkaʻi and her son into his household disrupts *moʻokū* (lineage hierarchy), prompting Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s violent restoration of order through the annihilation of both Pualiʻi and the invading chief **ʻAmaʻu**. The destruction of the sweet potato patches—symbolizing communal subsistence—by Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s supernatural strength underscores the narrative’s preoccupation with legitimacy through agricultural control, a cornerstone of Hawaiian chiefly power under *kapu* (sacred law). The stepfather’s demand for *ulua* (trevally) as a ritualized complement to sweet potatoes evokes pre-1819 *ʻai kapu* practices, where seafood was restricted by rank, while his lethal hypocrisy (“Kapu noa!” [non-sacred food]) mirrors the post-1819 transgressions viewed ambivalently in later Hawaiian print media.  

This tale aligns with **colonial-era editorialization** of moʻolelo Hawaiʻi. Though no extant versions predate the 1894 *Ka Nūpepa Kūʻokoʻa* serialization, its publication post-1893 coup reveals a calculated revival of indigenous heroic cycles. Unlike earlier 19th-century narratives positioning *kanaka Maoli* as passive subjects of Western civilization, Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s ruthless reclamation of Keahumoa through solitary, ritualized violence subverts colonial tropes of Native incapacitation. His **use of pule** (chant) to effect Pualiʻi’s death—invoking ancestral chiefs Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻa—signals continuity with pre-colonial priestly authority, while the final overthrow of Oʻahu’s chiefly hierarchy reflects anxieties surrounding the abolition of *mōʻī* (monarchy) after 1893. However, the absence of female agency—Pōkaʻi’s passive transfer between men and her infantilization in Paragraph 10 (“Nāmakaokapāoʻo ate nothing”) reinforces Victorian gender norms imposed during missionary-era cultural erasure.  

Geographic permutations in newspaper adaptations (Kula, Puna) contrast with the text’s emphasis on ʻEwa and Keahumoa, zones historically tied to Kamehameha’s consolidation of power by the early 1800s. The recurrence of **Mauka-Makekau-Honouliuli** in later chapters further links the story to Oʻahu’s central southern coast, a locus of military and revolutionary activity during the Kingdom’s collapse in the 1890s. 

Interpretively, the chapter functions as a **palimpsest of Hawaiian resistance**. Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s superhuman feats and divine genealogy (his demigod father Kauluakahaʻi) harken to the *moʻolelo* of Māui and Kamapuaʻa, yet his isolation—bereft of lineage except a single maternal figure—resonates with late-19th-century anxieties over cultural extinction. The story’s cyclical violence, climaxing in ʻAmaʻu’s failed invasion and Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s territorial conquest, may allegorize the paradox of Hawaiian agency post-1893: a brief surge of insurgent defiance (“ʻEwa and Keahumoa fell”) against occupying forces, followed by erasure under U.S. hegemony.  

Ultimately, this chapter exemplifies the dual function of serialized Hawaiian newspapers: to preserve oral traditions while refracting them through the lens of colonial trauma. Its militarized language, symbolic sacrilege (the roasted *ʻuala* with human head), and eradication of rival genealogies suggest both a mournful tribute to indigenous cosmologies and a subversive critique of their commodification in Anglo-American historical narratives. The story’s publication timeline—between the coup and annexation—thus positions it as a vessel for unresolved nationalist yearning, even as its archaic structures permitted deniability to colonial censors. Through Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s paradoxical agency, the text preserves a mythology of strength long after the formal end of *ka hae minolani* (sovereignty), weaponizing the past to critique the present."

Pōka‘ī became pregnant, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his homeland. Pōka‘ī remained with her pregnancy, and eventually gave birth. In this birth, Pōka‘ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were marked by immense spitefulness.","**Paragraph 2:**  
• The setting, **Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa**, anchors the narrative in a specific historical and spiritual landscape. ‘Ewa was part of the **moku** (district) on O‘ahu noted for its agricultural abundance and political strife in pre-contact Hawai‘i. Hō‘ae‘ae likely derives from *Hō-* (to cause) and *‘ae‘ae* (to stretch toward or connect), suggesting this place symbolized intersections—possibly between worlds (*ākua* and *kanaka*) or traditions (*old* and *emerging*), as seen in stories where birthplaces of demigods foreshadow their role as cultural transformers.  
• The phrase **“launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a”** (“lay together, the union resulted in conception”) uses metaphorical language rooted in Polynesian cosmology: sexual union (*moe ‘ana*) aligns with the generative act of creation (*launa*), where intention (*kino*) and desire (*loa‘a*) merge to produce life. This evokes the *Kumulipo* creation chants, where procreation links divine ancestry (*Kauluakaha‘i, a demigod) to mortal realms.  
• **Name etymologies and meanings:**  
  – *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (“The Eyes of the Pāo‘o Fish”): The *pāo‘o* (grouper fish) connects to *po* (darkness/sky), hinting at hidden power. The “eyes” (*maka*) symbolize perception beyond ordinary sight—possibly foresight or rebellion against rigid norms (as seen in Example 3).  
  – *Kau-lua-a-Kaha‘i* (“The Sustained One of Kaha‘i”): References Kaha‘i, a legendary voyager from Samoa (*Kahiki*) who introduced breadfruit (*‘ai kapu*) to Hawai‘i (Example 1 footnote). As Kaha‘i’s descendant, Kauluakaha‘i inherits *ākua* (divine) lineage, explaining his demigod status and his role in transmitting sacred customs.  
  – *Pō-ka-‘ī* (“Night Perpetuates Nobility”): The name combines *pō* (night, death, or spiritual realm) and *ka ‘ī* (to bestow rank). As a mother, Pōka‘ī bridges ancestral (*pō*) and mortal (*‘ī*) worlds, a critical role in *kapu* succession. Her “spitefulness” (*ilihune*) after childbirth may reflect the tension between her sacred duty and personal agency, common in stories of rebellious demigod offspring.  
• **Cultural practices during ‘Ai Kapu:**  
  – A divine *kāne* (father) like Kauluakaha‘i departing after conception reflects upper-class separations enforced by *ai kapu* protocols, where high chiefs (*ali‘i*) might only visit a commoner or lesser-ranking consort’s *hale* (house) transiently. The father’s return to his land (*“ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i i kona ‘āina”*) adheres to *kālai paoa* (ranked separation), ensuring the child’s *mana* (spiritual power) remained undiluted.  
  – Pōka‘ī’s solitary pregnancy (*“noho iholā me kona hāpai”*) aligns with *kanaka ‘ōpi‘ō* (young human) myths, where mothers endure hardship to birth exceptional children. Her spitefulness (*ilihune*), shared with the child, may symbolize resentment toward patriarchal systems (*ai kapu*) or foreshadow Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s future defiance (e.g., challenging *kāula* [prophets] who enforced *ai kapu* brutality).  
• **Allegorical implications:**  
  – The **“spitefulness”** (*ilihune*) at birth echoes the contested birth of *kānaka maoli* (native humans) in *Kumulipo*—beings born from *Pō* (darkness) who must reconcile their mortal flaws with divine potential. Pōka‘ī and her son’s mutual wrath subverts the *ai kapu* ideal of familial harmony (*lokahi*), suggesting tension between old laws (patrilineal authority) and emerging narratives that decentralize male divinity.  
  – The child’s parentage—*Kauluakaha‘i* (tied to *ai kapu*’s introduction via Kaha‘i’s arrival) and *Pōka‘ī* (linked to *pō*, chaos, and renewal)—frames Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a paradox: a divine heir born of *ai kapu* but fated to undermine its cruelty, like the ulua substituting human sacrifice (Example 3).","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puali‘i looked upon Pōka‘ī and desired her, saying: “I desire you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī replied: “How could you desire me? I have borne a child, and my body is now worn.” Puali‘i responded: “Those things matter not. If you desire me, let us love one another.” Pōka‘ī agreed and returned with her child and her new husband Puali‘i to dwell in the plains of Keahumoa.","**Paragraph 3:**  
• This passage introduces **Pua-li‘i** (puʻa = ""offshoot, sprout, new growth"" + liʻi = ""small, noble, childlike""), likely a descendant of chiefs (*aliʻi nui* or *aliʻi maikaʻi*), who arrives at Honouliuli (*Hono-uliuli* = ""Dark Bay,"" an area in ʻEwa, Oʻahu) from inland Līhuʻe (*Liʻu=ʻe* = ""tied fast,"" a land division in Wāhiʻawa). His status as a *kanaka maikaʻi* (noble person) aligns with genealogical narratives where chiefs frequently traveled between upland (***mauka***) and lowland (***makai***) regions to assert authority or seek alliances.  
– The practice of visiting homes (*kipa* at a *hale*) reflects pre-ʻAi Kapu era customs, where it was *polite* to welcome travelers (*kanaka pākākā*) with food and shelter. Pōkaʻī’s hospitality, even as a single mother, underscores the **universal obligation of generosity** (*hoʻokipa*), a foundational value in Hawaiian society that persisted even during the ʻAi Kapu.  
• The dialogue between Pua-liʻi and Pōkaʻī reveals tensions around **postpartum relationships** and bodily autonomy. Pōkaʻī’s hesitation (“*Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ʻinoʻino koʻu kino*”) reflects historical attitudes toward women’s perceived diminished beauty or *mana* after childbirth, a common motif in moʻolelo where *wahine* were often idealized as virginal or untouched.  
– Pua-liʻi’s rebuttal (“*He mea ʻole ia mau mea*”) subverts this norm, emphasizing **mutual desire** (*makemake*) over physical perfection. The phrase *e moe kāua* (literally “let us sleep together”) is a euphemism for both conjugal union and formal partnership, echoing traditional courtship practices where direct proposals (*ʻōlelo i ka pono*) were preferred to intermediaries.  

• The relocation to **Keahumoa** (*Ke-ahu moa* = ""Heap of Chickens"")—a real place in central Oʻahu, as well as a metaphor for abundance—symbolizes the couple’s creation of a new household (*hale*). This mirrors **migratory patterns** of *aliʻi*, who founded settlements in fertile, *māla* (agricultural) regions to sustain their lineages.  
– Pōkaʻī is described as returning with “*kāna kāne me Pualiʻi*,” clarifying that Pua-liʻi becomes her *kāne a keʻa* (husband or long-term partner), while the child (here unspecified in gender) accompanies them. The phrasing “*me kāna kāne*” emphasizes **continuity of maternal care**—Pōkaʻī does not abandon her child, a contrast to narratives like Pele’s exile, and asserts her agency in shaping her family structure.  
• The setting of Honouliuli gains symbolic weight: as a site associated with **liminality** (dark bays often represented transition between realms), it becomes a crossroads where fate (*kuleana*) is reshaped. Pua-liʻi’s arrival there, a fisher (*lawaiʻa*) navigating both sea and land, further positions him as a mediator between worlds, a common role for *kupua* (demigods) or culture-bringers in Hawaiian lore.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

The two large sweet potato patches bore his name even to this day: so named after the enduring legacy of Nāmakaokapāo'o. As he was harvesting the sweet potatoes, Puali'i spoke his ominous foreshadowing: ""Where is the ulua's head to eat with the sweet potatoes? I will not allow my wife, Pōka'ī, and the others to eat until I return with the ulua from Honouliuli's shore to complete the meal.""","**Paragraph 4:**  
• This passage builds on earlier motifs of agrarian labor and symbolic sustenance, while foreshadowing violence tied to the 'Ai Kapu era’s sacrificial symbolism. The dual sweet potato patches named after Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (""the eyes of the *pāo’o* fish"") mark a physical legacy in the land, connecting the protagonist to cyclical cultivation practices central to Hawaiian cosmology. Sweet potatoes (*‘uala*) are *kanu ho‘okamatā* (staple crops) requiring strict *kapu* observance for successful harvests, reflecting the paradox of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s relationship with tradition—he embodies ancestral power but destabilizes it.  
• Pua-li'i’s declaration, ""*Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala*"" (Where is the ulua’s head paired with the sweet potato?), evokes 'Ai Kapu protocols where *ulua* (trevally fish) symbolically substituted human sacrifices at heiau (*footnote:* Pukui & Elbert (1986) note *ulua* as a homonym for ""to increase"" and a term of endearment, bridging literal fish with divine-human exchange). By demanding the *ulua’s head* to accompany the *‘uala*, he invokes a ritualistic balance between land (*‘āina mai uka* = upland “inland” foods) and sea (*‘āina mai kai* = oceanic resources), with the fish’s head serving as the sacred portion (*kinolau*) offered to gods before consumption.  
– The threat to withhold food (*noa, ‘ai kāna wahine... me nā mea ‘ē a‘e*) from Pōka'ī and others until Pua-li'i secures the *ulua* aligns with *kapu aloha ‘āina* (territorial taboos where families fasted until harvest rituals concluded). Yet Pua-li'i perverts this practice: instead of fasting to ensure communal kinolau access, he weaponizes it to legitimize his vendetta against Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, implying the older *kapu* system’s potential for tyranny.  
• **Spatial alignment:** Pua-li'i journeys to Ho-no-u-li'uli (dark bay), a liminal zone traditionally associated with *kupua* (supernatural agents) and *mo‘o* (dragonfish) deities. The choice of *Honouliuli*—linked to 'Ewa district’s historical *heiau mo‘o*—suggests Pua-li'i adopting malevolent *kupua* powers to confront Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, whose own *manawa* (courage) and small-statured strength mirror archetypal *kupua* traits.  
– This spatial-rhetorical pairing (sweet potato fields → sacred bay) frames the conflict as one between *ʻolelo kū* (ritual invocations) and *ʻolelo hōʻemi* (destructive speech). Pua-li'i’s dependence on *ulua* to ritually sanctify *‘uala* signals regression to pre-contact *kapu* rigor, while Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s role as an agricultural *kinolau* emblem (fields bearing his name) points toward a post-*kapu* world where land stewards (*kuaʻāina*) replaced priestly elites (*kāhuna kapā*).  
• The persistent duality of two sweet potato patches and the ritual use of ""head"" (*po‘o*) and ""eyes"" (*maka*) echo earlier numerical riddles (2 fields, 4 vines, 40 mounds). Here, the two patches represent *kanu kū* (male, sun-facing crops) and *kanu a wāhine* (female, shade-tolerant crops), with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s name binding both identities—a transgressive synthesis of gendered agricultural *kapu* that foreshadows his ability to dismantle 'Ai Kapu conventions entirely by paragraph’s end.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo‘o went with seventeen children to Puali‘i’s sweet potato patches. Nāmakaokapāo‘o at this time had a very small body—two spans and half of his height, not yet strong enough to hold things firmly, just able to move about. Upon arriving at the sweet potato patches, he turned to the children and said, “Pull up the earth heap and the leaves entirely from the top, leaving nothing to grow.” However, the children were afraid, so they only lightly touched the sweet potatoes, not actually pulling up the heaps.","**Paragraph 5:**  
• **New narrative focus and continuity:**  
– This paragraph bridges Puali‘i’s absence (fishing) with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s emergence into active defiance against agricultural norms. The shift in setting to Puali‘i’s sweet potato patches (māla ‘uala) underscores the colonial undertones of land ownership (“his” sweet potatoes), contrasting with the primordial Hawaiian worldview where 'āina was communally tended.  
• **Reinforcement of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s paradoxical strength and physical description:**  
– “He kino ‘u‘uku loa” (very small body) reinforces his introduction as a child of “small stature” (Example 1), yet his name etymology (“Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o”: the eyes of the pāo‘o fish, a small coral reef fish) symbolizes **keen perception** amid physical diminutiveness.  
– “‘Elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e” (two fathoms and half of his height) employs Hawaiian linear measurements metaphorically. A kapua‘i (fathom) symbolizes human striving for land dominion, while “half its height” may allegorize a spirit-being’s relationship to physical reality—half divine, half mortal. The phrase contrasts with traditional genealogical power statements (e.g., Example 1’s demigod lineage) to foreshadow his **unorthodox leadership**.  
• **Generational conflict and agricultural destruction:**  
– Sending seventeen children (he ‘umi kumamāhiku = 10 + 7 = 17) to uproot Puali‘i’s crops evokes numerological symbolism: 17 as a composite of 10 (completeness) and 7 (spiritual power) suggests Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s command over **multiplicity in unity**, a theme central to post-contact Hawaiian resistance narratives.  
– The command to “huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala ā pau loa” (pull up the earth heap and leaves entirely) violates the ‘ai kapu’s protocol. Under ‘Ai Kapu, root crops like ‘uala (sweet potato) were planted, harvested, and consumed under strict rites. Ripping them up without ritual blessing incurred spiritual and social sanctions, positioning Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a **transgressive force challenging kapu order**.  
• **Children’s fear and Puali‘i’s looming authority:**  
– The children’s maka‘u (fear) and half-hearted action (“kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala”) reflect adherence to ‘Ai Kapu’s hierarchical structure, where commoners feared repercussions for violating kapu. Their inaction contrasts with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s authority, who—aligning with the *kāhiko* (ancient pre-civilized) archetype—acts as a **catalyst** for unchecked transformation.  
– Puali‘i’s impending return (“Ho‘i maila kona makua kāne kōlea ā hiki” from Example 3) is foreshadowed here, linking his rage (“threatening to eat Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s head”) to the **destruction of sacred resources** in this passage. His anger is not merely paternal but a defense of *kuleana* (stewardship), a microcosm of colonial clashes between indigenous and imported systems of control.  
• **Allegorical readings:**  
– Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s physical fragility juxtaposed with his destructive act mirrors the tension between Hawaiian resilience and invasive threats (e.g., foreign diseases, technologies). The “pu‘e” (earth heap) and “lau ‘uala” (leaves) symbolize fertility disrupted, a metaphor for colonial erasure of *lōkāhi* (harmonious balance) in land and kinship.  
– The children’s incomplete defiance (“‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e”) may represent the intergenerational struggle to balance tradition with change—a common theme in post-‘Ai Kapu literature.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Thus he destroyed both patches until the sweet potato vine mounds stood erect—there were forty mounds in total from the two patches. Then Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned and kindled a fire, roasting four sweet potato vines atop the open flame. While he was roasting them atop the fire, his stepfather, Puali‘i, arrived and reached [the house], questioning his mother Pōka‘ī: “No answer?” Puali‘i asserted, “Yes, his head and eyes are the relish to flavor my sweet potatoes today, so this will be the day I kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**  
• This passage contains rich allegory and numerical symbolism tied to the 'Ai Kapu era and proto-historical societal transitions:  
– **Numerical Symbolism:**  
– The destruction of *2 patches* (ʻ<b>elua</b>ʻ) echoes dualistic themes in Hawaiian cosmology (day/night, male/female, kapu/ʻaikāpō), suggesting conflict between traditional and emerging values.  
– The *40 mounds* (ʻkanahāʻ) of sweet potato shoots may reflect the <i>pauku</i> concept—a completed cycle or generation—potentially critiquing the cyclical nature of kapu enforced labor.  
– *4 vines* (ʻehāʻ) roasted mirrors the <b>four major kapuna</b> (Hāloa, Hina, Kanaloa, Kūkailimoku) or the four main islands, symbolizing how traditional subsistence practices sustained hierarchical structures.  

• **Etymological & Cultural Analysis:**  
– <b>Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo</b> (“the eyes of the pāoʻo fish”): The <i>pāoʻo</i> (a starfish or club?) links to <i>poʻo</i> (head), as both are central to sustenance rituals (e.g., <i>pāoʻo kani</i>—conch trumpet used in ceremonies). His destructive act of tearing sweet potato mounds may symbolically dismantle the sacred agrarian hierarchy.  
– <i>Pualiʻi</i> (“child of the chief”): His name reflects the <b>matrilineal inheritance</b> tensions of the 'Ai Kapu era. By threatening to consume his stepchild, he enacts violent patriarchal control over lineage legitimacy.  
– The threatened consumption of “<b>poʻo and maka</b>” (head and eyes) mirrors <i>ʻai kapu</i> restrictions, where only high chiefs consumed the ulua fish’s head. Here, Pualiʻi perverts this custom, substituting Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s body parts for the sacred food, critiquing <b>ritualized cannibalism as a tool of oppression</b>.  
– The roasted <i>ʻuala</i> (sweet potato) represents the <b>kānakaʻs lifeline</b>—destroying patches and consuming vines symbolizes rejection of the aikāpō (sacred farming cycle), while roasting vines (rather than tubers) implies disrespect for ʻuala’s dual role as both sustenance and deified ancestor (Ka-ʻōhiʻo-ʻuala).  

• **Cultural Practices in Action:**  
– The destruction of sweet potato mounds parallels the <b>demolition of heiau </b>post-Kamehameha II's abolishment of the 'Ai Kapu. Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s actions foreshadow <b>systemic rejection of oppressive traditions</b> tied to agrarian dominance.  
– Pualiʻi’s threat to “eat” the child evokes pre-Christian <i>kānaka loaʻa</i> (long-life rituals), where destroying a disobedient youth’s spirit ensured agricultural abundance. This underscores the <b>sacrificial rhetoric inherent to kapu enforcement</b>.  
– The stepfather’s accusation that Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s head/eyes are the “relish” (ili) for sweet potatoes inverts <i>ʻo kū lāʻau </i>practices: typically, root vegetables were seasonally blessed before harvest; here, the kāne invokes <b>violent consumption of human flesh</b> to maintain control.  

• The symbolism points to a philosophical clash:  
– Nāmakaokapāoʻo embodies <a href=""https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-4982-9780824891524.aspx"">moʻo kāne</a> (defiant male rebel archetypes) resisting oppressive systems. His manipulation of agricultural symbols (tearing patches, roasting vines) critiques the <b>theft of laborer agency</b> by ali‘i.  
– Pualiʻi’s response reflects a <b>doomsday theology</b>—if the sacred bond between people and land is severed, both the land and its people must perish. This mirrors historical violence during kapu violations, where communal survival hinged on ritual purity.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children were utterly terrified, fleeing and standing far away out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i declared to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: 'Hey! Here is my knife in my hand – today it will sever your head, chop off your head, then cook it with the sweet potato, and I myself shall eat it first, and only then will it be Kapu noa.' Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no heed to Puali‘i's words and spoke again, this time a second time. Puali‘i prepared to slice off Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head with the knife when Nāmakaokapāo‘o recited his death chant toward Puali‘i. He chanted thus:
The eyes of my pāoʻo fish here melt away.
Be silenced, fall prostrate face-down.
May you be devoured, may you be left behind.
May you be left behind, Kukui‘aimakaokalani.
That one is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,
This one is my lover.
Nāmakaokaiʻa, the great chief of Hawaiʻi,
May you flee, may you flee entirely.
It is the warrior with the spear,
The spear with the pahu drum.
Death to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.""","**Paragraph 7:**  
• **Name Etymologies & Divine Symbolism:**  
– *Pua-li‘i* (child of the ruler): His aggressive assertion of dominance with a **knife** (*koʻilipi*, an iron blade introduced post-European contact) reflects a hybridization of traditional chiefly authority (*aliʻi*) and foreign violence. His threat to ""eat"" Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s head mirrors *ʻAi Kapu* rituals where *ulua* substituted human sacrifice, but inverted—he weaponizes sacred cannibalism to uphold oppressive power.  
– *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo* (the eyes of the *pāoʻo* fish): His defiance amidst boiling *ʻōʻo* (sweet potato vines) ties him to *Kāne*, the god of freshwater and agriculture. The four vines likely symbolize the four *mauʻu* (districts) of Oʻahu, or the four winds of cosmological significance, subverting Pualiʻi’s violence into sacred agricultural renewal.  

• **Numerological Allegory & Subsistence Significance:**  
– The four (*ʻehā*) *ʻau ʻuala* (sweet potato vines) contrast with prior paragraphs’ ""two patches"" and ""40 mounds,"" reinforcing cyclical time and the *kālana* (reward) of patience. Roasting vines, not tubers, symbolically preserves *ʻuala*’s life-force (*mana*) for replanting, opposing Pualiʻi’s destructive consumption.  
– The children fleeing to a *kahi lōʻihi* (far place) mirrors the mythic departure of *kupua* (demigods) from human settlements during spiritual trials, emphasizing Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s status as a supernatural figure transcending mortal fear.  

• **Incantation Analysis & Subversion of Kapu:**  
– Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s *pule make* (death chant) layers multiple strata of meaning:  
– *Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāoʻo* (""The eyes of my pāoʻo fish just melt away""): Replaces Pualiʻi’s head-eating threat with a *pāoʻo* (smooth fish) metaphor, symbolizing fluid, indirect power (e.g., water’s persistence vs. iron’s rigidity).  
– *Kukuiʻaimakaokalani* (Beloved light [of heaven]): A veiled invocation of *Kāne*, the god of light (kukui) and heaven (kalani), seeking divine reconciliation. The name *Kukuiʻaimakaokalani* contains double *ma-* (“to serve” or “to die”; Elbert & Pukui, *Hawaiian Dictionary*), suggesting Pualiʻi’s death as an offering to reassert cosmic balance.  
– *Nāmakaokaiʻa* (The eyes of seawater): Shifts from *pāoʻo* (terrestrial fish) to *kaiʻa* (ocean fish), evoking *Namaka*, the water goddess, to unleash chaos against Pualiʻi. This duality (freshwater/saltwater) merges agricultural and marine domains under his control.  
– Chant’s climax: The *ihe* (spear) and *pahu* (drum) combo evokes *Pākanu* (war gods of Kāne and Kanaloa), but here they become a mortal koʻē (failure). By narrating his own death (*Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāoʻo*), the kūpua enacts auto-sacrifice to transmute Pualiʻi’s wrath into collective liberation, subverting *ʻAi Kapu*’s rigidity.  

• **Technological & Cultural Syncretism:**  
– *Koʻilipi* (knife) bridges pre-contact Stone Age tools and post-contact colonial weapons, reflecting the story’s *pilina ʻano* (hybrid temporality). Pualiʻi’s reliance on iron signifies dependency on foreign systems, whereas Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s fire-roasted *ʻuala* (native crop) asserts Indigenous sustenance practices.  
– *Kapu noa* (“only then will it be Kapu noa”): Pualiʻi’s jab at Kapu lifting mocks the chant’s purpose: Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s curse instead *consecrates* Pualiʻi’s death as a Kapu-breaking sacrifice that paves the way for *ʻAi Noa* (freedom from Kapu).","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Now we will briefly mention those two names: Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻa. They were high chiefs of Hawaiʻi. Nāmakaokalani was the father and Nāmakaokaiʻa the child, but [Nāmakaokaiʻa] had entered into the spiritual chant (pule) of Nāmakaokapāoʻo.","**Paragraph 8:**  
• This passage introduces two aliʻi nui (high chiefs) critical to the narrative:  
– **1) Nā-maka-o-kalani (m) (""the eyes of the sky/ruler""):** A supreme chief of Hawaiʻi, embodying classical *wagtail* (kalani) sovereignty. The name links to celestial authority, echoing pre-contact governance tied to divine right.  
– **2) Nā-maka-o-kaiʻa (m) (""the eyes of the ocean""):** Identified as the *keiki* (child) of Nāmakaokalani, whose maritime name (*kaiʻa* = ocean) contrasts with his father's celestial linkage, suggesting generational shifts in leadership or spiritual domains.  

• The reversal of dominance in the parent-child relationship is narratively significant:  
– While Nāmakaokalani holds *formal* authority as the father, the text emphasizes Nāmakaokaiʻa's entry (*komo i loko o*) into **Nāmakaokapāoʻo's pule** (spiritual invocation/chant). This implies the child is spiritually entangled with the demi-god Nāmakaokapāoʻo, first introduced as a physically mighty but morally ambiguous figure in Chapter 1.  
– In traditional governance (*ʻAi Kapu* social structure), lineage legitimizes authority, but here **genealogy alone is destabilized**—a prince *influenced by a demi-divine force* foreshadows conflicts between human sovereignty and spiritual intervention.  

• **Etymological symbolism:**  
– The name *Nāmakaokalani* centers power in the *sky* (*kalani*), evoking **Kāne**, god of procreation and creation, and alignment with *uplands*-oriented cosmology.  
– *Nāmakaokaiʻa* (ocean-eyes) reflects the maritime *Lono* axis, protector of fishing and bounty, yet his *kaiʻa* (ocean) could also invoke chaotic coastal moʻo (water guardians).  
– The child’s participation in Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s *pule* (first mentioned in Paragraph 3 as a force of destruction) merges these domains, hinting at **syncretic spiritual dynamics** or hybrid authority.  

• **Cultural allegory in *ʻAi Kapu* context:**  
– High chiefs (*aliʻi nui*) were custodians of *ʻAi Kapu*, the sacred code restricting food access and social interaction. By placing Nāmakaokaiʻa within Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s *pule*, the narrative juxtaposes **hereditary rank** with **unpredictable divine influence**—a tension central to pre-Spaniard Hawaiian society.  
– The *pule* (possibly a war chant or invocation to Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s parent, Namakeha, ""the eyes of the gods"") may represent **spiritual realignment** against rigid hierarchy. This mirrors the protagonist’s earlier rebellion against his stepfather Pualiʻi’s *ʻAi Kapu*-compliant violence (Paragraph 6), where ecological destruction symbolized resistance to sacrificial customs.  

• **Prophetic implications:**  
– The child’s name *Nāmakaokaiʻa* (""eyes of the ocean"") paired with his mystical alignment evokes **Kamohoaliʻi**, Pele’s shark brother, known to assume pāoʻo (fish-like) forms. Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s *pule* might thus signify ancestral invocation or possession, framing the prince as a vessel for primordial power.  
– Such spiritual collisions often preceded **kinolau** (incarnations of deities) in Hawaiian historiography. Here, it may foreshadow Nāmakaokaiʻa’s role as a transitional figure bridging *ʻAi Kapu* traditions and emerging cosmologies (post-ʻAi Kapu collapse, 1819).","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Nāmakaokapāoʻo seized the head of Pualiʻi and hurled it into the depths of Waipouli, a cave by the beach of Honouliuli, a distance of five miles.""","**Paragraph 9:**  
• **Posthumous dialogue and mana symbolism:**  
– The disembodied head of Pualiʻi continuing to speak after decapitation reflects Hawaiian cosmological beliefs about ʻuhane (spirit) retaining agency even after physical death. This motif often signifies unresolved conflict or powerful ʻino (spiritual energy) lingering in a place. The head’s declaration of *aloha* contrasts sharply with its violent separation, hinting at duality: Pualiʻi’s lingering affection (*aloha*) versus his destructive jealousy.  
– In pre-ʻAi Kapu cultural frameworks, the head (*poʻo*) was considered the most sacred *ʻaumākua* (family guardian spirit) of a chief, housing their *mana* (spiritual power). Pualiʻi’s head retaining speech suggests his identity as a *moʻo-aliʻi* (chieftain) persists despite death, yet is now diminished—his power being tossed as refuse into a cave, symbolizing the rise of new social orders.  

• **Name etymologies and allegorical contrasts:**  
– *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo* (“the eyes of the pāoʻo fish”): The *pāoʻo* (family Scaridae) symbolizes tenacity and armored resilience in Hawaiian oral traditions. Its association with Na-maka’s “eyes” (maka) reinforces his role as a seer or avatar of oceanic forces, linking him to *Namakanui* (Great Eye), a Polynesian star deity governing navigation. His survival here underscores his supernatural endurance amid violent transformation.  
– *Pualiʻi* (“Pua-(flower)-iʻi (small) of the chief”): His name implies noble status (*aliʻi*) softened by delicacy (ʻpuaʻiʻi), yet his violent act contradicts this imagery. This juxtaposition may allegorize the corruption of traditional virtues under oppressive *ʻAi Kapu* norms, where even those of gentle names enact brutality.  

• **Waipouli and Honouliuli: Geomythological significance:**  
– *Waipouli* (“meek waters”): The cave destination for Pualiʻi’s head is named for subdued waters, symbolizing containment of his *ʻino* (evil/spiritual pollution). Depositing it there aligns with ceremonial practices of isolating dangerous *pokiʻi* (spiritual remnants) in *ana* (caves) to prevent communal contamination (*kapu* breaking).  
– *Honouliuli* (“dark bay”): This coastal area in ʻEwa, Oʻahu, was historically associated with clandestine *hula* and forbidden rituals (*ai noa*—breaking the *ʻAi Kapu*). The placement of Pualiʻi’s head here may encode memories of the *ʻAi Kapu*’s overthrow in 1819, with Na-maka casting the old order’s remains into a space historically linked to kapu transgression.  

• **Numerology and ritual transformation:**  
– The **five-mile** (*‘elima*) distance reflects the sacred number *elimā* in Hawaiian symbolism, often tied to the five fingers (ʻelimā lima) representing human dominion, or the five legendary islands of origin (*panalāʻau*). Here, it may signify the full liberation of Na-maka’s mana from terrestrial limits (*mōkīna*—boundaries), contrasting with Pualiʻi’s confinement to static *kupua* (shapeshifter) vengeance.  
– The absence of a trial or council (*ʻaha*) before Pualiʻi’s execution reflects the collapse of *ʻAi Kapu* governance structures. His summary death by *koʻilipi* (knife, a tool of haole influence) introduces colonial-era metaphors—foreign weapons enabling abrupt cultural rupture, presaging the later imposition of Western legal frameworks.  

• **Cosmic inversion of primal allegories:**  
– While earlier texts feature heroes preserving *ʻohana* (kin) through divine favor (e.g., Kahaʻi retrieving Hema’s eyes), this passage subverts that: Pualiʻi attacks his kinsman, and the decapitated head’s blessing mirrors *ʻAhukū* (loving destroyer) motifs in Pele’s chants, where creation arises from relational violence. Na-maka’s action—banishing the head to the sea—parallels *Kāne* and *Kanaloa* shaping the sacred land by casting marine debris ashore, but here inverted: chaos (not order) is cast into the oceanic source.  
– The use of a knife (*koʻilipi*, a loanword from English “collapsible”) instead of traditional *ʻōʻō (javelin) or niho iʻa (shark-tooth blade) marks a historical inflection point. Where ancestral deities like Kāne demanded ritualized killing via specific *koʻa* (sacred tools), Pualiʻi’s weapon underscores the erosion of cosmological cohesion in transitional periods.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
