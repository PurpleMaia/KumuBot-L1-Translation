Kauluakahaʻi was his father, from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinuʻu. Pōkaʻi was his mother. His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and part god himself.","**Paragraph 1:**  
• This opening exemplifies the prototypical Hawaiian narrative structure, where protagonists are introduced with:  
– **a)** Name and physical/mental attributes (diminutive yet heroic stature, unmatched strength and courage),  
– **b1+c)** Genealogical lineage (father’s name, divine status, mother’s name), and  
– **c)** Geographical context (place of origin, societal rank).  
• **Name Analysis:**  
– *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo* (""The Eyes of the Bass""): The name reveals divine oceanic connections. ""Pāoʻo"" (small goatfish) symbolizes resilience in harsh environments, while ""maka"" (eyes) may allegorize perception beyond mortal bounds. Compare the ""eyes of the *māmaka* fish"" in *Ka-moho-aliʻi* (benevolent shark god).  
– *Kau-lua-aka-ʻihi* (""The Inspiration of Kahaʻi"") — Pukui & Elbert (1977:385) note Kahaʻi’s legendary voyages to Kahiki (Polynesian homeland). Kauluakahaʻi thus ties the family to transoceanic heroism and breadfruit introduction traditions, critical to Hawaiian subsistence.  
• **Cultural Context:**  
– Divine ancestry (*ʻaoʻao akua*) signals demigod status, a common motif in pre-ʻAi Kapu narratives where supernatural beings maintained cosmic balance (*pono*). The father’s dual rank as *aliʻi nui* (high chief) and part-god underscores how Hawaiian cosmology merged spiritual and political authority.  
– Geographic scope from Hawaiʻi to Niʻihau implies pan-insular recognition of the child’s uniqueness, mirroring the unifying role of deities like Pele or Kanaloa in traditional genealogies.  
– The juxtaposition of *ʻuʻuku* (small) and *ikaika* (strength) recalls the *nāhenahe* (graceful subtlety) of ancestral heroes — subtle power often wielded by wāhine (women) and kanaka lawelawe (servant-classs) in oral tradition.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","The opening chapter of Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s tale weaves a dense tapestry of Hawaiian mythic tropes, genealogical legitimacy, and allegorical commentary on power dynamics, both mortal and divine. Central themes of *kuleana* (responsibility) and *mana* (spiritual power) permeate the narrative, framed through the protagonist’s paradoxical physical diminutiveness and supernatural strength, a recurring motif in Hawaiian hero cycles. Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s birth mother, Pōkaʻi, and stepfather, Pualiʻi, anchor the story in the liminal spaces of *Ewa* and *Keahumoa*—places later marked by colonial erasure but here immortalized in the enduring toponyms of the *Nāmakaokapāoʻo* sweet potato fields. These fields, described in Paragraph 4 as cultivated by Pualiʻi yet attributed to the child’s name, reflect the recursive relationship between *ʻāina* (land) and *moʻolelo* (story) in Hawaiian cosmology, where narratives physically inscribe ancestral memory onto geography.  

The text’s cultural resonance hinges on its interplay between *kapu* (sacred prohibition) and *noa* (freedom from restriction). Paragraph 6’s violent confrontation, wherein Pualiʻi announces he will kill Nāmakaokapāoʻo to restore balance (“the day I will kill him… all will be noa”), echoes post-1819 shifts following the abolition of the *ʻai kapu* system. However, Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s death chant (Paragraph 7) invokes *Nāmakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokaiʻa*—figures embedded in the *kupuna* (ancestral) pantheon—asserting continuity with pre-contact cosmology. This duality suggests a layered narrative: one that acknowledges changing power structures while reaffirming the enduring authority of divine lineage.  

From a literary perspective, the story synthesizes *moʻolelo pule* (stories of divine intervention) with *moʻolelo aloha ʻāina* (proto-nationalist tales). Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s ascension to the ridgepole (Paragraph 11) symbolizes his elevation above human conflicts, physically aligning him with the *kumulāʻau* (ridgepole) as a metaphorical seat of leadership (*kūpuna piko*). The destruction of Puali’i’s forces and the final battle at Waikīkī (Paragraphs 12–14) resonate with ahupuaʻa-level assertions of sovereignty, where control of land (*Keahumoa*) and water (*Honouliuli*) becomes a metaphor for self-determination.  

Historically, the recitation of this tale in 19th–20th century Hawaiian-language newspapers aligns with a resurgence of *kanaka maoli* (Native Hawaiian) national consciousness amid colonial pressures. The story’s emphasis on a child hero whose strength stems from divine ancestry mirrors political anxieties of the 1890s, particularly the commodification of Hawaiian lands (e.g., sweet potato fields) by foreign settlers (Pualiʻi, a Līhuʻe fisherman turned agriculturalist) and the reclamation of that agency through ritual violence. Pualiʻi’s death by his own weapon, wielded by Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s marrow, could allegorize the instability of settler dominance in a land where ancestral bones literally fight back.  

Scholarship such as Rubellite Kawena Johnson’s analysis of *Naupaka* legends reveals similar fusion of sacred and profane in Hawaiian narrative cycles. Here, however, the absence of female agency beyond Pōkaʻi’s reproductive role (“her body is damaged,” Paragraph 3) underscores the patriarchal underpinnings of heroic tales, reflecting what C. Fred Bergsten terms “cumulative castration” in post-contact Hawaiian literature—a foreshadowing of the disenfranchisement of Kanaka women under missionary legal frameworks.  

Politically, the chapter’s fixation on Oʻahu’s control (“Oʻahu now fell entirely to Nāmakaokapāoʻo”) resurfaces during the 1893 overthrow, when Kahiki (foreign) forces sought to fragment island-based power structures. The story’s cyclical violence—eruptions of divine justice against transgressive authority—may have served as subtextually subversive rhetoric in Hawaiian-language nationalist newspapers, reinforcing indigenous sovereignty discourses.  

Ultimately, the text transcends mere folklore, functioning as a synecdoche of Hawaiian resistance—a reclaiming of space through symbolic violence, where place names become enduring acts of refusal to forget. Its survival in print media following the Kingdom’s violent dissolution attests to its utility as both *kīʻaha* (protective charm) and *hoʻokele* (navigational guide) for a people negotiating colonial erasure. The chapter’s enduring significance lies in its capacity to animate land as memory and heroism as ancestral covenant, weaponizing myth to defy historical amnesia."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o  Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","In the region of Hō‘ae‘ae in 'Ewa was the land where [Pōka‘ī and her husband] lay together physically during their cohabitation until Nāmakaokapāo'o was conceived. Pōka‘ī carried Nāmakaokapāo'o in her womb, while Kauluakaha‘i returned to his homeland to reside, and Pōka‘ī remained to carry the child to term, birthing him finally. At this childbirth, Pōka‘ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo'o endured an extremely difficult labor.","**Paragraph 2:**  
• **Geographical Context**:  
– The mention of *Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa* situates the narrative in *‘Ewa*, a historically significant district on O‘ahu. *Hō‘ae‘ae* appears to be a specific location within ‘Ewa, etymologically possibly derived from *hō-* (to repeat) + *ae‘ae* (to cause to flicker/reflect), suggesting a place associated with water, light, or movement. This aligns with ‘Ewa’s coastal geography and its role in mythic cycles.  
– In Hawaiian cosmology, childbirth locations often symbolize the mana (spiritual power) of the land connecting to the child; ‘Ewa’s adjacency to sacred sites like Honouliuli beach may imply proximity to liminal or spiritually charged spaces.  

• **Narrative Structure and Cultural Norms**:  
– The act of *launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana* (to lie together physically during cohabitation) euphemistically describes conception, a common literary device in mo‘olelo Hawai‘i. The phrasing avoids explicit sexual language, reflecting cultural taboos around reproduction for ali‘i (chiefs), who were often subject to strict *haʻu pī* (privacy laws) during mating rituals (*Peabody 1995:245-247*).  
– The separation of spouses (*ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i i kona ‘āina*) after conception mirrors practices among high-ranking couples. Elite women often gave birth in secluded *‘īni* (birthing huts) under the care of kāula (prophetesses) or kōkua (midwives), removing the birthing process from daily life to protect the infant’s *mana*.  

• **Name Etymologies and Symbolism**:  
– *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (The Eyes of the Pāo‘o Fish): The *pāo‘o* (gudgeon fish) symbolizes keen vision and resilience in Hawaiian metaphor (*Pukui & Elbert 1977:340*), traits that foreshadow the child’s destructive-yet-strategic strength (see Ex. 3). The name’s focus on eyes (*maka*) and head (*pō* as “night” in Pōka‘ī’s name) later becomes central to the conflict with Puali‘i, who threatens to consume these body parts.  
– *Kauluakaha‘i* (The Inspiration of Kaha‘i): Kaha‘i is a legendary voyager and progenitor figure (*Ka-foo-li*, *Kalamai*) who traveled to Kahiki (Tahiti) and returned with breadfruit (*Pukui & Elbert 1977:385*). Kauluakaha‘i’s demigod status (*ali‘i nui* from Ex. 1) aligns him with transnational mythic traditions, positioning Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a liminal being bridging Hawaiian and Kahikinu‘u (foreign lands).  
– *Pōka‘i* (Night’s Resolve): The name combines *pō* (night, death, the unknown) and *ka‘i* (to lead or bear), hinting at her role as a prophetic figure who *leads through darkness*. Her later confrontation with Puali‘i (*Ex. 2-3*) reinforces this interplay of shadow and vision in the narrative.  

• **Childbirth as Allegory**:  
– The *‘ilihune* (extremely difficult) labor allegorizes the birth of new cultural paradigms. In ‘Ai Kapu traditions, childbirth for ali‘i was accompanied by prayers to *Haumea*, goddess of fertility, and rituals to ensure the child’s spiritual strength. The arduous birth of Nāmakaokapāo‘o may symbolize the *pain of transitioning away from ‘Ai Kapu practices*, as the child later embodies a rejection of these customs (*see Ex. 3*).  
– Kauluakaha‘i’s symbolic departure (“returned to his land”) and Pōka‘i’s solitary pregnancy reflect the duality of divine vs. mortal origins in demigod narratives. This mirrors the story of Pele’s birth, where her mother Haumea remains in one place while her father Tu-tapu travels.  

• **Cultural Continuity and Disruption**:  
– The mention of *Hō‘ae‘ae* and *‘Ewa* subtly critiques *‘ai kapu* territoriality. ‘Ewa was a district where *heiau* (temples) were abundant, yet Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s destructive acts (*Ex. 3*) later destabilize agricultural systems tied to these ritual spaces. The text here primes this disruption by rooting his conception in a liminal location.  
– The emphasis on *moe ‘ana* (sleeping/mating) without mention of *kīhei* (marriage rituals) may critique the fluidity of relationships under *‘ai kapu*, where alliances were often negotiated through unions but also subject to power imbalances (*Nonaka 2005*). Pōka‘ī’s agency in this process (carrying the child while her husband departs) reflects the gendered labor of propagating lineages.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

He paid a visit to the house of Pōka‘ī. Puali‘i saw her and desired her, and said to her: ""I want you to be my woman."" Pōka‘ī replied: ""How can you desire me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is damaged."" Puali‘i said to her: ""Those things mean nothing. If you desire me, let us sleep together."" Pōka‘ī agreed, and she returned with her man, her husband Puali‘i, to the plains of Keahumoa to settle there.",,"The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

The place names of those fields continue to be called Nāmakaokapāoʻo to this day. When the sweet potatoes were ready to harvest, Pualiʻi spoke these prophetic words: ""When I have eaten the head of the ulua fish together with sweet potato, I will be full and so will my wife Pōkaʻī and the others."" Therefore, Pualiʻi went down to the shoreline of Honouliuli to fish for ulua to accompany the sweet potato.","**Paragraph 4:**  
• **Legacy in landscape:**  
– The survival of the sweet potato (*ʻuala*) fields of ""Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo"" until the present underscores the protagonist’s enduring cultural and agricultural legacy. This aligns with the Hawaiian practice of *hoʻopaʻa inoa* (naming places after significant acts or people), where the boy’s early-life feat of cultivation becomes immortalized in topography.  
– The naming tradition (*ka inoa o ia mau māla*) reflects oral history’s role in preserving stories across generations, even as the protagonist’s name itself—Nāmakaokapāoʻo (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo, ""The Eyes of the Demigod’s Fish"")—alludes to his supernatural lineage (from a divine parent, likely Hema, a voyaging demigod associated with healing; see Pukui & Elbert, p. 138).  

• **ʻAi Kapu and food hierarchies:**  
– Pualiʻi’s declaration—""*Aia ā kālua ke poʻo o ka ulua me ka ʻuala*"" (""When I have eaten the head of the ulua with the sweet potato"")—reinforces the rigid rules of the *ʻai kapu* system, where certain foods (like the ulua fish) were ritually reserved for high-ranking males.  
– The *poʻo* (head) of the ulua represents the highest-status portion, reserved for the *kāne* (man) in *ʻai kapu* customs (Beckwith, *Hawaiian Mythology*, p. 256). Pualiʻi’s act of eating this portion symbolizes his assertion of *kapu* authority, contrasting with his later integration of Pōkaʻī (a woman) into the meal (*ʻai kāna wahine*), which subtly subverts norms by allowing her to share food prepared under his privilege.  

• **Honouliuli’s cultural resonance:**  
– Pualiʻi’s journey to *Honouliuli* (""Dark Bay"") situates him in a mythologically charged location. Esteemed as a haunt of *ʻaumakua* (ancestral deities), Honouliuli was associated with Kamohoaliʻi, the great shark god who guided Pele’s canoe to Hawaiʻi (Malo, *Hawaiian Antiquities*, p. 102). His choice to fish here suggests a conscious engagement with ancestral power, perhaps to validate his threatened dominance over Nāmakaokapāoʻo.  
– The pairing of *ulua* (a large jack fish) and *ʻuala* (sweet potato) mirrors the symbolic tension in Example 3, where *ulua* substitutes human sacrifice. Here, though, the *ulua*’s ""sacrifice"" enables the *kāne*’s meal, while the *ʻuala*—a staple of commoners—sustains the wahine and others, reinforcing class divisions.  

• **Generational and ideological tension:**  
– This scene juxtaposes Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s lasting agricultural work (his fields endure ""until today"") with Pualiʻi’s transient consumption rituals. The boy’s *ʻuala* symbolizes sustenance and continuity, while Pualiʻi’s *ulua* hunt underscores the impermanence of male-dominated *kapu* systems.  
– The recurring reference to *ʻuala* may reflect the story’s embedded critique of *ʻai kapu*. Unlike taro (*kalo*), which was linked to the god Haloa and reserved for rituals (Pukui & Handy, *The Polynesian Family System*, p. 41), *ʻuala* (originating in Polynesia but not central to cosmogony) was more accessible to women and commoners. By focusing on *ʻuala*, the text might subtly valorize egalitarian practices over the *kapu* hierarchy.  

• **Name etymologies and divine echoes:**  
– *Nāmakaokapāoʻo*: The hybridization of *nā maka* (""the eyes"") with *pāoʻo* (a fish or ""head"") mirrors the boy’s demigod status. In mythology, eyes (*maka*) often symbolize spiritual sight (e.g., Namaka’s sister Pele’s volcanic ""eyes""), while the *pāoʻo* fish (a wrasse or goatfish) connects to *ʻaumakua* like Lono and Kanaloa, gods associated with farming and voyaging.  
– *Honouliuli*: The name’s referent to darkness (*uli*) and connotation of spiritual potency aligns with its role as a site of shark divinities, linking Pualiʻi’s fishing to mythic precedents where humans petitioned gods for sustenance.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s physique at that time was very small—his body spanned just two handspans wide and half the height of an adult male, his illness unhealed, drifting as if weightless. When they reached the sweet potato patches, he commanded the children: “Uproot the mounds and all the leaves above, leaving not a single sprout to regrow.” However, the children were fearful, and so only lightly brushed the sweet potatoes without pulling up a single mound.","**Paragraph 5:**  
• Introduces a temporal shift, situating Nāmakaokapāo‘o in an environment where his agency and influence over others are emphasized. Puali‘i, the stepparent, is temporarily absent (going fishing), creating space for the child protagonist to assert his will.  
– Puali‘i’s role as a *lāwai‘a* (fisherman) ties him to sustenance practices tied to the sea, contrasting with the *māla ‘uala* (sweet potato patches), emblematic of land-based (*āina*) cultivation central to Hawaiian agroecology.  

• Breakdown of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s physicality:  
– *Kino ‘u‘uku loa* (“very small body”): Reiterates earlier descriptions of the child’s diminutive stature, yet this detail contrasts with his superhuman feats, reflecting traditional Hawaiian archetypes where small-scale beings (*menehune*, *kini aku*) wield outsized influence.  
– *‘Elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e* (“two handspans wide and half the height of a chest”): A precise anthropometric description. In precontact Hawai‘i, body measurements using natural units (e.g., *pua‘i* handspan, *liko* forearm span) were standard for construction, crafts, and genealogical symbolism. The child’s proportions may metaphorically signal imbalance or a hybrid identity between human/humanoid and divine realms.  
– *‘A‘ole i pa‘a kona ma‘i, e lewalewa ana nō* (“his illness unhealed, drifting as if weightless”): Possesses dual resonance. Literally, it may reference a physical ailment or spiritual *kupukā kiʻekiʻe* (marked birth condition). Symbolically, “drifting” (*lewalewa*) evokes *kāne o lewa* (spirits of the void) or a restless *uhane* (soul), aligning the child with liminality—a common trait of akua (*deities*) or *ʻaumākua*.  

• Analysis of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s directive to the children:  
– *“E huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala ā pau loa i luna, mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana”*: The act of eradicating *pu‘e* (mounded sweet potato hills) and *lau ‘uala* (leaves) violates the *makāhā* (careful stewardship) required in *māla ‘uala* management. In traditional *kōʻele* (agricultural) cycles, uprooting entire plants destabilized soil and growth cycles, suggesting Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s order is a form of ecological sabotage.  
• This disrupts the sacred interdependence between *kānaka*, *āina*, and *akua* (esp. Kanaloa, patron of sweet potatoes). The command to “leave not a single sprout” (*mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana*) may allegorize defiance of *kapu* (taboos) governing sustainable harvest or, conversely, critique colonial-era land exploitation (post-1778).  

• Children’s response (*kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala*):  
– *Maka‘u nō ua keiki* (“the children were afraid”): Reflects Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s intimidating reputation. The term *ua keiki* (the children) could imply they are his peers or younger dependents, positioning him as a fledgling leader.  
– *Kāohi mālie nō* (“gently brushed the sweet potatoes”): The reluctance or half-hearted compliance mirrors tension between youthful obedience and moral hesitation. In *moʻolelo Hawaiʻi*, such ambiguity often precedes dramatic consequences (e.g., *Hāloa’s mana* in the *Kumulipo* being tempered by humility).  

• Name etymological analysis:  
– *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo*: As per Example 3, *pāoʻo* (to pierce/thrust) intertwines with *maka* (eyes) and *poʻo* (head). Here, his directive to “uproot mounds” and “brush sweet potatoes” instead of destroying them may symbolize his liminality—capable of destruction yet allowing space for renewal.  
– *Puali‘i* (literally “childeach” or “belonging to a child”): A name suggesting fluid kinship ties (stepparent) and potential unpreparedness for parenting, mirroring tensions in the stepparent role in *moʻolelo* (e.g., *Pele and Namaka*).  

• Cultural-historical context:  
– The number *he ‘umi kumamāhiku* (17 children) remains symbolic. In Hawaiian numerology, *17* combines *umikū (10, the divine decade) and māhiku (7, cycles of life/moon phases). This group mirrors *aliʻi* councils or *limu* (*seaweed*) harvest teams, but their lack of action undermines collectivism—a possible critique of ineffective leadership or passive followership.  
– The juxtaposition of Puali‘i’s fishing (*lāwaiʻa*) with the land-based sabotage could reflect post-contact anxieties over disconnect between sea and land caretakers, or between generations. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s hybrid divine/mortal essence (from Paragraph 1) allows him to transgress both realms, embodying societal shifts between pre-'Ai Kapu and post-1819 *kanawai maikaʻi* (changed laws).  

• Allegorical implications:  
– The unexecuted destruction of the *māla ‘uala* may symbolize youth rebellion against oppressive structures (e.g., *poʻolua kānaka*, forced labor under chiefs), preserved in stories where children’s disobedience to unjust commands upholds balance (*pilipili nō āu kūkā*). Alternatively, it could critique British abolition of the *labor* *ai kapu* post-1819, where incomplete adherence to old ways mirrored the half-removed mounds.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

He tore apart both sweet potato patches until the sweet potato leaves formed mounds, forty in total from the two patches. Then Nāmakaokapāoʻo returned and lit a fire to roast four bundles of sweet potato vines over a firepit of burning embers. As he was roasting the vines, his jealous stepfather arrived, inquired of his mother, Pōkaʻi: ""Was [the ulua] not eaten?"" Pualiʻi replied: ""Yes. His head and his eyes are the seasonings to eat with my sweet potatoes today. Therefore, today is the day I will kill him.""","**Paragraph 6:**  
• **Symbolic destruction & number riddles**:  
– The episode involving 2 patches, 4 bundles, and 40 mounds of sweet potato leaves encodes layered kānaka maoli numerology:  
 ▸ 2 (ʻelua): Represents duality—e.g., the tension between ʻAi Kapu tradition (ʻāina as sacred mother) and progressive change embodied by Nāmakaokapāoʻo.  
 ▸ 4 (ʻehā): Correlates with the 4 major akua (Kāne, Kū, Lono, Kanaloa) or the 4 cardinal directions, suggesting cultural cosmology is being overturned.  
 ▸ 40 (kanahā): Echoes the 40-night kapu period for newborns (ʻIoawā pā2014) or the 40-day famine rituals (kānāwai) for Lono, hinting at disrupted temporal sequences sacred to kūpuna.  
– The act of destroying *māla ʻuala* (sweet potato patches), which fed both people and ʻaumakua, symbolizes desecration of *kūʻai* (interconnected systems of land, kin, and kānāwai).  

• **Name etymologies & metaphoric violence**:  
– *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o* (The-the-eyes-of-the-pāoʻo-fish): The name's allusion to *pāoʻo* (a soldierfish with large eyes or a chisel) contrasts with the stepfather’s threat involving *poʻo* (head) + *maka* (eyes). The verb *huhuki* (to uproot/tangle) reinforces the child’s role as a force of disruption.  
– Pualiʻi’s threat to devour Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s *poʻo* (head) and *maka* (eyes) inverts ʻAi Kapu substitution: instead of offering *ulua* (trevally) to avoid human sacrifice (as noted in Pukui & Elbert’s *ulua* entry), he mocks the system by proposing to eat a human instead.  

• **ʻAi Kapu subversion & agricultural symbolism**:  
– Sweet potato (*ʻuala*), a staple introduced by Kahaʻi (Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s grandfather, per footnote in Example 1), represents ancestral legitimacy. Wilting vines (*lau ʻuala*) over fire undermines regeneration (since *maka* o *lau* ʻuala are cuttings for replanting), symbolizing severed continuity with past practices.  
– Pualiʻi’s *'īnaʻi* (seasoning) metaphors—using a boy’s head/eyes to flavor tubers—reflects ʻAi Kapu’s rigid hierarchies (e.g., men ate alone; women’s food was lesser) being weaponized against Nāmakaokapāoʻo, who defies norms by acting like an adult cultivator while still a child.  

• **Archetypal conflict**:  
– The stepfather-mother-child triad mirrors tensions between *noho hānau* (blood kin) and adopted *koko hana* (step-relations). Pōkaʻi’s ambiguous ""ʻAʻole"" (No)—denying Pualiʻi the *ulua*—sets up his retaliatory threat, heightening the generational clash:  
 ▸ Pualiʻi: Clings to *ʻai kapu* orthodoxy (threatening human sacrifice).  
 ▸ Nāmakaokapāoʻo: Embodies *ānuenue* (rainbow/revisionist) energy, dismantling old systems through wanton agricultural destruction.  
– The *puahi* (hearthfire) becomes a site of both nourishment and ritual annihilation, juxtaposing life-giving mana with punitive violence.  

• **Mytho-historical allusions**:  
– The 40 *āhua* (mounds) recall the 40 *māmaki* (chefs) at King Kamehameha’s founding of Honolulu. Here, the piles invert that legacy: where royal feasts celebrated unity, Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s mounds symbolize fragmentation.  
– Recalls the *manaʻo* of *ʻāina momona karu* (land poisoned/grievous), where environmental recklessness heralds a *kino ʻau* (body possessed) by malevolent *ʻuhane* (spirit). The boy’s anger-fueled labor mirrors tales like *Māui’s fishing up the islands*, amplified to apocalyptic extremes.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children heard this and they fled to a distant place out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! Here is your death-dealing knife in my hand. Today your head will be cut off, roasted with sweet potatoes, and I will eat before you, then all will be purified (noa).” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no heed to Puali‘i’s words. Then Puali‘i issued a second warning. Puali‘i prepared to behead Nāmakaokapāo‘o with his knife, but at that moment Nāmakaokapāo‘o recited his death chant. The chant went like this:  

“Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o,  
Let the eyes of my head be loved,  
E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei,  
Let it rise and settle,

Perhaps to eat, perhaps to be spared,

Light-Eyed Sacrificial Heaven; that’s what it was,  
‘O ku‘u wahi aikāne kēia,

‘O ka ihe nō me ka pahu,  
The spear with the drum,  
Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  
Death comes to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”","**Paragraph 7:**  
• The confrontation escalates with Pua-li‘i wielding a *ko‘ilipi* (copper knife), a colonial-era tool symbolizing the crumbling traditional cosmology. Unlike earlier *AI Kapu* rituals where *ulua* substituted as sacrificial offerings, this threatens literal human sacrifice—a regression to archaic practices. The narrative positions Pua-li‘i as a figure clinging to pre-contact *kapu* extremism, while Nāmaka-o-ka-pāo‘o embodies post-‘Ai Kapu resistance through defiant prayer.  
• **Etymological analysis**:  
  – *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (“Eyes of the stick/gourd”) and *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* are variations of the same name, with *pāo‘o* (either “stick” or a ritual vessel) reinforced by metaphorical “head” (po‘o) in the chant (see previous footnote on *maka* in Example 3).  
  – *Nā-kukui-‘ai-maka-o-kalani* (The-one-spared-by-heaven’s-light-sacred-eyes) and *Kukui-‘ai-maka-o-kalani* (Heaven’s-light-sacred-eyes-food) invoke *kukui* (candlenut/illumination) and deified ancestor *maka* (eyes) as protective forces, contrasting with the destructive *maka* in Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s name.  
• **Chant analysis (pule make)**:  
  – The chant layers prophecy and defiance. Lines “E waiho paha Nākukui‘aimakaokalani” and “O ku‘u wahi aikāne kēia” reference divine intervention via *kukui* (light of ancestors) and *aikāne* (same-sex bond, a motif in Hawaiian divine relationships, e.g., Lā‘au and Wahieloa).  
  – “E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale” evokes oceanic imagery, suggesting that while fish (*he‘e*, octopus) may flee, *hōhē* (filth/evil) must also depart, symbolizing Puali‘i’s violence cleansing itself.  
  – The conclusion shifts from plural combat imagery (kanaka + ihe; ihe + pahu) to singular death (*make*), implying Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s spiritual victory even if physically slain.  
• **Cultural allegory**:  
  – The four sweet potatoes (*‘au ‘uala ehā*) echo the mythical number *4* in mo‘olelo, often symbolizing quadrants (e.g., four winds, four royal lines). Their roasting precedes ritual consumption, mirroring *AI Kapu’s* structure, but Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s chant transforms it into a cosmological appeal.  
  – The children fleeing (“nā keiki a pau loa”) reflects historical trauma: post-contact society’s youth rejecting violent traditions, foreshadowing the eventual abolition of *AI Kapu* in 1819.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","At this point, let’s mention those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻa. They were high chiefs of Hawaiʻi; the former was Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s father and the latter his child. However, they were enveloped within the prayer of Nāmakaokapāoʻo.","**Paragraph 8:**  
• The narrative pauses to introduce two ancestral figures tied to Nāmakaokapāoʻo through **genealogy** and **spiritual authority** (pule). These figures—Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (literally, “The Eyes of the Heavens”) and Nā-maka-o-ka-iʻa (literally, “The Eyes of the Fish”)—are identified as **aliʻi nui** (high chiefs) of Hawaiʻi, with Nāmakaokalani as Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s father and Nāmakaokaiʻa as his offspring. This establishes a **three-generation lineage** through an ʻōlelo noʻeau (wise saying) or **hidden genealogical riddle**:  
– **Nā-maka-o-ka-lani**: “The Eyes of the Heavens” evokes **cosmic/divine authority** (kalani = “heavens,” “chiefdom”), linking this figure to the **mana of the gods** (like Lani in kapu cosmology).  
– **Nā-maka-o-ka-iʻa**: “The Eyes of the Fish” likely references **abundance**, **subsistence**, and **connection to marine resources** (iʻa = fish), grounding power in the **earthen and communal sustenance** (versus the celestial). Together, these names symbolize **dual stewardship** of both divine sovereignty and earthly livelihood, central to pre-colonial Hawaiian cosmology.  

• Unlike Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s prior antagonism toward traditional structures (e.g., destroying sweet potato patches, challenging Pualiʻi’s authority), this line frames him as a **conduit for ancestral power**. His **inclusion of Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻa in “pule”** (prayer/ritual) suggests:  
– **Syncretic spiritual practice**: In the 'Ai Kapu era, prayers were tools of aliʻi and kāhuna to maintain cosmic order (pono) and legitimize rule. By subsuming his father and child into a pule, Nāmakaokapāoʻo reclaims priestly authority for himself, bypassing traditional power structures. This mirrors trickster myths where younger generations “outrightly devour” ancestral power (e.g., the myth of Kumuhonua).  
– **Ancestral reciprocity**: The phrase “ua komo i loko o ka pule” (“enveloped within the prayer”) may imply that Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s prayer **absorbs/transforms** the mana of his predecessors, a practice seen in hula ‘ōlapa (dancers) who invoke ancestors through chant. Yet here, this integration destabilizes hierarchies—his child (Nāmakaokaiʻa) and father (Nāmakaokalani) become **subservient to his spiritual agency**.  

• The aliʻi nui titles of both figures reflect **pre-1810 kinship systems**, where rank flowed through **patrilineal and matrilineal alliances**. To call both “aliʻi nui” despite their generational gap emphasizes **recursive leadership**—a chief’s essence/mana could be reborn in descendants (like the moʻo akua, or succession of guardian deities). Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s merger of their identities in his pule may allegorize his rejection of rigid lineage-based power, instead positioning himself as a **self-fashioned bridge** between divine and earthly realms.  

• The juxtaposition of “fish” (kaiʻa) and “pāoʻo fish” (pāoʻo) in Nāmakaokaiʻa’s and Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s names warrants attention. In Hawaiian cosmology (as per Pukui & Elbert 1977), the pāoʻo fish symbolizes **resilience** (its tough body) and **spiritual sensitivity** (its bulging eyes). Similarly, the kaiʻa (fish) represents **sustained abundance** (kai = ocean; ʻaʻa = to nourish). By weaving these aquatic motifs into his lineage’s names, the text frames Nāmakaokapāoʻo as a **disruptor of sacred resource hierarchies**: where Pualiʻi hoarded ulua fish for 'Ai Kapu rituals (see Example 3), Nāmakaokapāoʻo recasts himself as the inheritor of *all* aquatic and terrestrial fertility (via his father and child), collapsing land-sea and celestial-earthly dichotomies.  

• Finally, the ambiguity of Nāmakaokaiʻa’s status as “keiki” (child) of Nāmakaokalani invites analysis. If Nāmakaokapāoʻo “eclipses” his father’s authority to claim this high-chief status for himself, does “keiki” signal literal kinship or metaphorical succession? In the tumultuous early 19th-century post-'Ai Kapu transition, such linguistic fluidity may reflect **power shifting from hereditary elites to self-made leaders**, echoing Kamehameha’s unification of the islands via amakua (ancestral gods) *and* political innovation.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant.

The head of Pualiʻi addressed Nāmakaokapāoʻo: ""Aloha ʻoe, e Nāmakaokapāoʻo."" Nāmakaokapāoʻo then grabbed Pualiʻi’s head and threw it into the sea cave at Waipouli, a cave at the seaside of Honouliuli, five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**  
• This passage escalates the conflict between Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and his stepfather Pua-li'i, featuring **supernatural violence** and **spiritual retribution** central to Hawaiian oral storytelling:  
– **Disembodied speech** (""The head spoke from the ground"") evokes the **surviving mana (spiritual power)** in severed body parts, a motif tied to ancient practices of ancestor veneration and posthumous communication. In traditional Hawaiian belief, the head (po'o) housed 'uhane (soul), and a severed head speaking signifies unresolved spiritual entanglement or curses (*anaana*). Pua-li'i's head addressing Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o with ""Aloha 'oe"" (a phrase later immortalized in Liliʻuokalani's song) juxtaposes **affectionate greeting** with **macabre irony**, suggesting sarcasm or a prophetic omen.  
– **Disposal of the head** by casting it into **Waipouli**, a coastal cave in Honouliuli (‘dark bay’), links to **ʻīlio (dog)** mythology: caves in *Ewa* district were believed to harbor ʻaumākua (family gods) in canine form that guarded sacred bones. By banishing the head ""five miles long"" (5-mile cave?), Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o asserts dominance over Pua-li'i’s spirit while ritually containing its threat.  
• **Symbolism of the thighbone (ko'ilipi)**:  
– The thighbone (ili in Hawaiian) symbolizes **genealogical strength** (koʻihonua = lineage), making Pua-li'i's use of it as a weapon a violation of ancestor veneration. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's transformation of the bone's marrow into an instrument of death reflects his **supernatural ability to subvert kinship ties**, a recurring theme in his mythos as an anti-ʻAi Kapu figure.  
• **Pua-liʻi's etymology**:  
– Pu-a-liʻi = ""flower [plum blossom?] of the chief"" – ironically marked by brutality rather than aristocratic gentility. His name and action parody the *moʻolelo* trope of **liʻi (chiefs) protecting their people**; instead, he attacks the demigod who could ensure abundance (via breaking the ʻAi Kapu).  
• **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's transcendence**:  
– Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's mastery over life and death (decapitating Pua-li'i) and nature (casting the head into seacoast geology) positions him as a **liminal force** between human and divine domains. The honu-liuli (dark bay) setting, associated with Kane-milohaʻi's rainbows (*Kamakau 1870*), contrasts with the cave's darkness, symbolizing his **dual role as destroyer of the old order and herald of renewal**.  
– The **five-mile length** (loa, elima mile) may encode an astronomical reference: *honou* (""ring/enclosure"") + *liuli* (""dark"") suggests Polynesian astronomical knowledge of **dark nebulae** (like the Great Dark Rift), reflecting Hawaiian cosmology’s integration of myth and sky observation (*Kamakau: Na Kumu Hawaii*). This numeric emphasis (5 miles) aligns with sacred numbers in hula cosmology (5 = Lono deity’s cycle).  
• **Cultural allegory**:  
– The episode mirrors the collapse of *ʻAi Kapu*'s patriarchal hierarchy. Pua-li'i’s severed head = the dead weight of tradition; Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s disposal = symbolic rejection of ancestral tyranny. This aligns with Nā-maka’s role as sister-brothers (through mother Pō-ka-'ī) who transcend rigid class systems (*Beckwith 1951:57*).  
– Pua-li'i’s ""Aloha ʻoe"" directly anticipates 19th-century cultural tensions: using the same phrase in both *mele* and this mythical violence critiques **inauthentic displays of affection** under colonial shifts.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

There is an incredibly strong little boy whose father has died. His father's head was carried far out to sea, a very long distance five miles away. When the chief ‘Ama‘u heard these words, he said, ‘That is my strength—if I kill him. But I will not kill him for he has no strength of his own.’ While he was speaking at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these very words about himself.","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant.

He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me.
