namakaokapaoo_ch1_p1,1,1,"He keiki ‘u‘uku loa ‘o **a)** Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a he  keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio, ‘a‘ohe ona lua  ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau, i ka  ‘u‘uku a me ke koa loa. **b1)** ‘O Kauluakaha‘i, kona   makua kāne, **c)** no Kahikipapaialewa, he ‘āina i  Kahikinu‘u. **b2)** ‘O Pōka‘ī ka makuahine. **c)** He ali‘i  nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa, a **b1)** he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona.","She is a very small child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and she was a very strong child in her youth; she had no equal in these islands from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau, in stature and in warrior prowess. Kauluakaha‘i, her father, was from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was the mother. Her father was a great chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he had a divine aspect as well.","• The figure of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as “keiki ‘u‘uku loa” (a very small child) who is simultaneously “ikaika loa” (very strong) presents an allegory of underestimated power and latent strength.
  – This duality reflects Hawaiian values where physical size does not limit mana (spiritual power) or capability, signifying the deeper meaning that true power lies beyond mere appearance.
  – The mention that she had “no equal… from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau” echoes the traditional concept of the archipelago’s unity and emphasizes her significance across the entire island chain, possibly symbolizing an idealized leadership or divine figure encompassing all the islands.

• The name Nāmakaokapāo‘o warrants a detailed etymological and symbolic analysis:
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o can be broken down as “The eyes (nā maka) of the fog or mist (ka pāo‘o),” connoting mysterious vision or clarity through obscurity.
  – In Hawaiian mythological symbolism, mist or fog often represents a veil between the physical and spiritual worlds, suggesting that Nāmakaokapāo‘o embodies a bridge or guardian between these realms.
  – The “eyes” emphasize perception, insight, and watchfulness, indicating her role as a seer or protector figure within the narrative.

• The father, Kauluakaha‘i, is linked to a specific location, Kahikipapaialewa in Kahikinu‘u, anchoring the legend in a real or symbolic locale with possible historical importance:
  – ‘Ka-hiki-papa-ialewa’ suggests a place where the horizon or boundary (kāwiki/papa) “leans up or stands up” (ialewa), perhaps indicating a high or sacred vantage point, symbolizing authority and divine connection.
  – The designation of Kahikinu‘u itself is historically associated with regions in Hawai‘i known for strong chieftains and spiritual centers, suggesting that Kauluakaha‘i represents chiefly power intertwined with sacred geography.
  – The text states Kauluakaha‘i was “a great chief” (ali‘i nui), reflecting the ʻAi Kapu period’s rigid social hierarchy, where chiefly rank combined political, military, and religious authority (Kamakau, 1992).

• Pōka‘ī, the mother, introduces a matrilineal dimension often underrepresented but culturally significant in Hawaiian genealogies:
  – Her presence acknowledges the dual parental lines crucial for establishing mana and chiefly legitimacy.
  – The simple naming without detailed origins might reflect the historical tendency to emphasize chiefly male lines post-contact, hinting at a loss or transformation of older matriarchal narratives amid missionary-era and Western influence post-1819.

• The phrase “he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona” (he had a divine aspect) asserts the fusion of human chiefly status with akua (godly) qualities, typical of Hawaiian ali‘i (chief) ideology:
  – This blending of sacred and political leadership illustrates the Hawaiian worldview that ali‘i were earthly manifestations of gods, legitimizing their rule through genealogy and spiritual power (Malo, 1951).
  – The passage’s structure, repeating phrases like “he makua kāne” (father) and “no Kahikipapaialewa” with circular references, serves as a poetic riddle emphasizing lineage continuity, a common feature in traditional mele and mo‘olelo, which encoded genealogies for oral transmission.

• The overall narrative reflects a social commentary on inherent strength beyond physical form and the integration of spiritual authority within chiefly lineage during the late pre-contact to early post-contact era:
  – The stress on unmatched youthful strength and divine ancestry may allegorically critique the undermining of native authority in the face of Western influence after 1819, reminding readers of an enduring, though often invisible, native power.
  – The emphasis on being “without equal” and of high birth across multiple islands subtly reasserts Hawaiian sovereignty and identity amid cultural upheaval following the abolition of the kapu system and the arrival of Christian missionaries (Beckwith, 1970).

There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97).

The narrative weaves together the sacred genealogy of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, her complex family relationships, and the socio-political struggles that define her ascent as a prominent figure in Hawaiian lore.

A primary theme is the tension between lowly birth and inherent greatness. Despite being born to Pōka‘i and considered of low status after her father Kauluakaha‘i’s departure, Nāmakaokapāo‘o displays exceptional warrior prowess and spiritual strength that surpass all others across the islands. This transformation from vulnerable child to mighty ruler underlines a cultural motif celebrating hidden power and destiny that transcends social rank.

The chapter also explores familial and supernatural dimensions pivotal in Hawaiian narratives. The involvement of divine aspects in Kauluakaha‘i’s lineage situates Nāmakaokapāo‘o within a sacred genealogy, linking her to chiefs like Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a under her spiritual authority. The dramatic episode where Puali‘i attempts to kill Nāmakaokapāo‘o through burning sweet potato vines symbolizes ritualistic and symbolic conflict, with Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prayer reflecting deep spiritual agency. The severing and speaking of Puali‘i’s head evoke themes of mana (spiritual power) and the triumph of rightful authority.

Historically and culturally, this chapter offers insight into chiefly genealogies and territorial dynamics within O‘ahu and neighboring islands. The mention of places like ʻEwa, Honouliuli, and Waikīkī anchors the story geographically, emphasizing the importance of land and lineage in Hawaiian identity. The detailed description of sweet potato patches as strategic and symbolic sites highlights the interconnection between agriculture, sustenance, and political power.

The chapter is significant in Hawaiian literature as it preserves oral traditions that affirm the legitimacy of ruling chiefs through divine ancestry and heroic deeds. It demonstrates narrative techniques such as invocation of genealogy, ritual prayers, personification of natural elements, and vivid battle scenes that enrich the cultural tapestry. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s conquest of O‘ahu and defeat of rival chiefs like ʻAmaʻu encapsulate themes of rightful sovereignty and the sacred duty of leadership, resonating with broader Polynesian traditions of chiefly authority.

Synthesizing the passages, the chapter tells a cohesive story: Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a small but spiritually potent child born under difficult circumstances, survives early threats including the near-murder by Puali‘i. Through supernatural intervention and personal valor, she overcomes foes and doubt, exacting vengeance and solidifying her rule. Her journey from obscurity to power parallels the transformation of the land she governs, symbolizing renewal and the enduring connection between chiefly power, spirituality, and ancestral mandate in Hawaiian culture.

Overall, Chapter 1 functions as both an origin tale and a testament to the resilient spirit of Hawaiian chiefs, underscoring the deep integration of mythology, history, and cultural values in Hawai‘i’s rich literary heritage."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Pōka‘ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Kauluakaha‘i then returned to his land, leaving Pōka‘ī, who lived with his pregnancy and later gave birth. Upon this birth, Pōka‘ī and his child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were considered very lowborn or of humble status.","• The passage allegorically situates the origins of Nāmakaokapāo‘o within the ‘Ewa district, a region rich in cultural and genealogical significance.
  – ‘Ewa is historically known as a fertile and politically important land division on O‘ahu, often linked to prominent ali‘i (chiefs).
  – The phrase “launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho” stresses intimate physical union, signaling not just conception but a binding of genealogies or social meanings—possibly underscoring a blend of divine or mortal ancestry.

• Analysis of character names reveals layered symbolism reflecting natural forces and genealogical complexity.
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o: Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o translates to “The eyes of the billowing surf,” symbolizing eyes shaped or influenced by powerful ocean waves, reflecting the transformative, watchful, and potentially tempestuous nature of the sea. This aligns with traditional Hawaiian cosmology where the ocean is a key ancestral and elemental force.
  – Pōka‘ī: Po-ka‘i can be parsed as “night” (Pō) and “to chase” or “to pursue” (ka‘i), possibly indicating a shadowy or elusive figure, or referencing the dark unknown from which new life or status emerges.
  – Kauluakaha‘i: Ka-ulu-a-ka-ha‘i can imply “the growth of the tide” or “the rise of the wave,” suggesting a figure embodying movement, transition, or the returning of energies to their source (returning to his land).

• The social commentary embedded in their statuses (“he ‘ilihune loa”) suggests a tension between sacred genealogy and social rank.
  – The designation of Pōka‘ī and her child as very lowborn (‘ilihune loa) could reflect historical realities under the Ai Kapu system, where lineage and rank were rigidly enforced, yet births of ambiguous or contested parentage often resulted in demotion or marginalization.
  – This may also reflect the post-contact influences where narratives began to incorporate Christian or Western notions of legitimacy, purity, and social hierarchy, perhaps critiquing or lamenting lineage disputes.
 
• The sequence of events—union, pregnancy, departure, birth, and status assignment—mirrors cycles of Hawaiian ancestral storytelling and genealogical rites.
  – The departure of Kauluakaha‘i after conception parallels motifs of absent or aloof paternal figures found in many Hawaiian mo‘olelo, illustrating tensions between land, genealogy, and legitimacy.
  – Pōka‘ī’s solitary journey through pregnancy and motherhood emphasizes the female role as a caretaker of lineage amidst instability, reflecting the cultural importance of women in maintaining and transmitting genealogies, especially during the post-1820 missionary period, when family structures were challenged by new social mores.

• Numerological and symbolic elements:
  – The mention of only one child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, may underline singular importance or unique spiritual status, often common in chiefly genealogies to assert exclusivity.
  – The motifs of ocean (‘pāo‘o’ wave) and shore (‘ka‘ī’ tide) evoke natural cycles, reinforcing Hawaiian conceptions of time and genealogy as continuous and interwoven with nature’s rhythms (Kanahele 1995).

• Historical and cultural context:
  – The passage reflects a pre-1819 worldview, before the abolition of the Ai Kapu system, when birth status and land ties defined social order.
  – The complex interpersonal dynamics may critique or reflect disruption during early contact periods, where traditional practices of genealogy and rank were challenged by foreign legal and religious ideas.
  – The notion of marginality (‘ilihune loa’) can be read as a subtle narrative on the consequences of shifting norms and the fragility of ali‘i status in turbulent times.

When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

Puali‘i looked upon Pōka‘i and desired her, saying: “I want you for my wife.” Pōka‘i replied: “How can you desire me? I have borne a child, and my body is blemished.” Puali‘i answered: “These things are nothing; if you want me, we shall be together.” Pōka‘i consented. Then Pōka‘i returned with her husband to Puali‘i at the district of Keahumoa and lived there.","• Allegorical reading of relationships and desire:
  – Puali‘i’s approach to Pōka‘i symbolizes social or spiritual desire that transcends conventional stigma. Pōka‘i’s hesitance due to having borne a child and feeling bodily imperfection suggests cultural ideas about purity or status, possibly reflecting Hawaiian notions of kapu related to women’s fertility and sexuality (Kameʻeleihiwa, 1992).
  – Puali‘i’s reassurance that those conditions “are nothing” may allegorically critique rigid kapu or social barriers, demonstrating a transition period in Hawaiian society as traditional restrictions were questioned or softened, especially post-Ai Kapu abandonment in 1819.

• Analysis of character names and symbolism:
  – Puali‘i (Pua-li‘i) can be broken down as “Pua” (flower; youth or beauty) and “li‘i” (chiefly or small/young), representing perhaps a youthful, noble figure embodying renewal or new social ideals.
  – Pōka‘i is “Pō” (night, dark, mystery) plus “ka‘i” (to lead, to escort); this may symbolize a female figure connected with mystery or the unconscious, leading or guiding in a subtle way—her initial rejection and later consent represent transformative potential.
  – The place names also bear significance: Līhu‘e (“spread wings”) and Honouliuli (a coastal area known for fishing) point to livelihood and connection to nature, fitting Puali‘i’s role as a fisherman and provider.

• Historical and cultural contextualization:
  – The passage hints at social dynamics in Kaua‘i during early 19th century, a time when missionary presence and changing cultural norms led to reevaluation of familial and marital structures (Silva, 2004).
  – Pōka‘i’s statement about her body being “blemished” after childbirth might metaphorically reflect the shift from traditional kapu systems concerning women’s reproductive roles, highlighting tensions caused by Western influence on Hawaiian cultural and gender expectations.
  – The narrative’s willingness to affirm sexual union despite past childbearing may indirectly reflect post-contact Hawaiian society’s evolving attitudes toward women’s sexuality and the erosion of strict kapu in the post-1820 period.

• Broader thematic connections:
  – Numerically, the dialogue involves a dyad of male-female figures negotiating social boundaries, perhaps echoing traditional Hawaiian concepts of duality and balance (kānaka and wāhine, mana and noa).
  – The emphasis on place and movement (Pōka‘i returning “to Puali‘i at Keahumoa”) underscores Hawaiian values of ‘āina (land) as foundation of identity and social relationship.
  – This passage may serve as subtle social commentary on reconciliation and acceptance amidst shifting mores, reflecting a cultural moment when Hawaiian society negotiated between tradition and new realities.

He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p4,1,4,"Noho ihola i laila, mahi ‘ai, ‘elua āna mau māla  ‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā, a ua kapa ‘ia  ka inoa o ia mau māla, ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i  kēia lā.

Regarding the sweet potato, Puali‘i said in his vow, “There is the head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato roasted together, and Puali‘i eats it, then it is free, and his wife Pōka‘ī and the others also eat.” Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat along with the sweet potato.","• The passage describes a sustained agricultural practice centered on sweet potato cultivation.
  – The two long sweet potato gardens symbolize continuity and fertility, suggesting a deep connection to the land ('āina) maintained across generations.
  – The naming of the patches as Nāmakaokapāo‘o implies cultural or spiritual significance, preserving ancestral knowledge and place identity (Kepā, 2012).

• The figure “Puali‘i” functions allegorically, potentially representing a chiefly person or ancestral figure who mediates between land and sea resources.
  – The name Puali‘i can be broken down as Pua-li‘i: “flower” (pua) and “chief/child” (ali‘i or li‘i), evoking imagery of a noble or sacred origin.
  – His vow or declaration involving “the head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato roasted together” connotes a ritual meal or symbolic union of land (uala) and sea (ulua fish), reflecting the Hawaiian concept of fo‘ou or cyclical renewal in sustenance (Kanahele, 1986).
  – The term “noa” (free) here signals the lifting of kapu or restriction, a critical cultural theme especially in the context of food (Ai Kapu system). This may allegorize a period after the 1819 kapu system abandonment or illustrate a mythic return to freedom of resource use.

• The wife’s name, “Pōka‘ī,” also carries meaning: pō (night/darkness) + ka‘i (to lead or follow), which could suggest a complementary role, perhaps the feminine presence guiding or following natural cycles or social structures.
  – The mention that both Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī eat, along with “others,” underscores communal sharing, a fundamental principle in Hawaiian society.

• The movement from the land (farming patches) to the sea (Honouliuli fishing) emphasizes the integrated Hawaiian subsistence economy.
  – Honouliuli itself has significant historical resonance, linked to both ancestral use and, post-contact, the infamous internment camp during World War II, though the narrative likely focuses on pre-contact or early contact histories.
  – Fishing with sweet potato as an accompaniment highlights the complementary dietary strategies, reflecting the balanced use of multiple natural resources.

• The text’s preservation of place names and specific food practices aligns with Hawaiian oral traditions that encode ecological knowledge and genealogical identity.
  – The ritual or vow expressed by Puali‘i may be a mnemonic device reinforcing social cohesion and reciprocity with the land and sea.
  – The passage subtly references the tension and eventual relaxation of kapu restrictions, an important cultural transition just prior to or during early missionary influence circa 1820, indicating layered historical consciousness.

When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s body was very small, two lumps with some on top of his head; his sickness was not cured, he was still weak. When they arrived at those sweet potato patches, she said to the children, “Pull up the bunch with all the sweet potato leaves on top; don’t leave any that are still growing."" But the children were afraid, so they gently controlled themselves with the sweet potatoes, and did not pull up the bunch.","• Allegorical representation of the characters and setting  
  – Puali‘i’s act of fishing symbolizes traditional Hawaiian subsistence activities tied to the ‘Ai Kapu era’s resource practices. The detail that he is fishing while the children tend to sweet potato (uala) patches reflects gendered and age-based roles in resource gathering.  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s presence with exactly seventeen children (kumamāhiku = 10 + 7) may signify a symbolic number, as Hawaiian numerology often imbues numbers with layered meanings; seventeen might indicate completeness or a sacred group, reflecting social structure or ancestral lineages (Kanahele, 1986).  
  – The description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as “very small, two lumps with some on top of the head” and “not cured of his sickness” allegorically depicts a weakened or transitional spiritual state, perhaps illustrating the fragility of cultural knowledge or leadership during periods of social upheaval. This can be interpreted as a metaphor for the fragile state of Hawaiian traditions post-contact and just prior to the abandonment of the kapu system in 1819.

• Analysis of the name Nāmakaokapāo‘o  
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pā-o‘o breaks down as “the eyes (nā maka) of the wall (ka pā) of the sacred enclosure (ʻo‘o).” This may invoke a guardian or overseer figure watching over sacred boundaries—both literally in agriculture and metaphorically in cultural preservation.  
  – The name may imply a protective yet watchful role, overseeing the children who represent future generations, and the cultivation of sweet potato, a staple dietary and cultural resource, metaphorically linking vigilance to sustenance.

• Symbolism and cultural significance of the sweet potato patch scene  
  – Sweet potatoes (uala) held significance in Hawaiian culture as staple crops introduced and propagated with care and ritual. The instruction to “pull the bunch with all the leaves” and “leave none growing” could be a metaphor for total commitment or harvesting all potential cultural knowledge, leaving no legacy “growing” unattended.  
  – The children’s fear and gentle restraint might symbolize the cautious maintenance of traditions under external pressures—reflective of Hawaiian society’s gradual exposure to foreign influences and the subsequent missionary period post-1820, which often discouraged or altered traditional practices.  
  – The frustrated but gentle harvesting process can be interpreted as social commentary on the tension between innovation and preservation in the Hawaiian worldview, where respect for the land (aloha ‘āina) and the ‘uala symbolizes nurturing yet sustainable use of resources.

• Historical and cultural context  
  – This narrative operates at the cusp of the post-kapu era (immediately following 1819), where old religious and social orders were being questioned or abandoned. The “sickness” not yet cured may symbolize the lingering effects of cultural dislocation and disease introduced by contact with foreigners—impacting the bodies and spirits of the people.  
  – The presence of multiple children under the guidance of a weakened elder suggests the liminality of this period—between traditional knowledge and emerging new ideologies, highlighting the challenges of intergenerational knowledge transmission.  
  – The story may encode a subtle critique of the failure to fully “harvest” or preserve cultural knowledge amidst fear and uncertainty, prompting reflection on the consequences of hesitant cultural stewardship.

• Post-contact influences and narrative tones  
  – The slightly detached and clinical observation of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s physical condition may reflect Western-influenced biographical or medical perspectives introduced by missionaries and scholars, suggesting a blend of indigenous storytelling with post-contact documentary styles.  
  – The narrative’s emphasis on obedience (“do not leave any growing”) yet children’s cautiousness introduces a tension that might mirror early Hawaiian communities’ oscillation between adherence to traditional authority and adaptation to new social realities under missionary influence.

In sum, this passage uses dense symbolic imagery—numerical, bodily, and agricultural—to illustrate a moment of cultural vulnerability and potential renewal in early 19th-century Hawaiian society, emphasizing the delicate balance between preservation and change during a critical historical juncture.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p6,1,6,"I ia wā, noke aku ana ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ka  huhuki ā pau kekahi māla ‘uala ā luna o kekahi  māla ‘uala, pēlā nō ka huhuki ‘ana ā pau nā māla  ‘elua ā kū ke āhua o ka lau o ka ‘uala, he kanahā  āhua ka nui o nā māla ‘elua.

In this way, all two patches were pulled up until the appearance of the leaves of the sweet potatoes stood, about one and one-half (kanahā) times the size of the two patches. Then, Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned and lit a fire, and as the fire burned, the four vines (‘au) of the sweet potato dried up on the fire. While he was burning up on the fire, his paternal uncle Kōlea came and asked his mother, Pōka‘ī: “No?” Puali‘i answered: “Yes, the head and eyes are the ones that cause my sweet potatoes to keep spraying today, so this is the day that he will die for me.”","• The figure of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as an agent of transformation  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s act of pulling up all the sweet potato patches metaphorically represents a complete harvesting or perhaps a purging of resources and vitality. Sweet potato (uala) is a staple crop with deep ancestral significance, symbolizing sustenance and life cycles (Beamer 2014).  
  – The detail that the leaves stand about one and one-half times (kanahā) the size of the two patches may encode a numerical allegory; kanahā (one and a half) often signifies a measure of imbalance or transitional growth in Hawaiian riddling tradition (Malo 1951). This indicates an incomplete or intermediate stage, perhaps reflecting societal upheaval or spiritual transition.

• Symbolism of fire and vines (‘au) in Hawaiian cultural worldview  
  – Lighting a fire to burn the vines ‘au of the sweet potato signifies a ritual cleansing or ending. Fire in Hawaiian cosmology is both destructive and regenerative (Kamakau 1991), used to cleanse kapu (taboo) or end cycles. The four vines can symbolically represent the four major directions or family lines, indicating an encompassing scope of this transformative act.  
  – The drying and burning of the ‘au may suggest the demise of a certain lineage or system, potentially referencing the old kapu system’s decline during transitional years around 1819 (Ai Kapu era ending), when resource control and social structures were dramatically altered.

• The paternal uncle Kōlea and the mother Pōka‘ī as narrators and witnesses  
  – Kōlea means “the dark or black bird,” often associated in Hawaiian lore with watchfulness or messengers from the spiritual realm (Pukui & Elbert 1986). His role as a questioner before Pōka‘ī indicates an inquiry into fate or the spiritual state of affairs.  
  – Pōka‘ī, whose name can mean “to snatch” or “to grab,” responds with confirmation, stressing the head and eyes as the cause of the sweet potatoes “spraying” (perhaps a metaphor for growth or life force). The interplay suggests that the “head and eyes” (probably leadership or insight) governs abundance or vitality in the land/crops.  
  – This dialogue encodes a power dynamic and foreshadows death (“this is the day he will die for me”), which can be interpreted allegorically as the death of an old system or authority figure whose control or insight once ensured prosperity.

• Names as layered meanings and allegorical devices  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o: Nā-maka-o-ka-pā-o‘o translates as “The eyes of the hard-fought boundary,” evoking the notion of vigilance over contested or sacred ground. This figure may embody the enforcement or disruption of socio-political boundaries or kapu (taboos).  
  – Kōlea, as noted, the dark bird, often omen-like or representing spiritual intermediaries, is poised as an observer or harbinger of change.  
  – Pōka‘ī, meaning “to seize or grasp,” functions as the maternal source of knowledge or tradition, signaling continuity and assertion of karmic or genealogical authority.

• Contextualizing the passage historically and socially  
  – The pulling up of the patches and burning of vines can be read against the backdrop of early 19th-century Hawaiian society approaching the end of the Ai Kapu era (1819) and the 1819 abolition of the kapu system by Kamehameha II. The narrative reflects tensions between old and new orders, agricultural fertility linked to sacred authority, and the consequences of disruption (Kamakau 1991).  
  – The interaction between Kōlea and Pōka‘ī may evoke the societal questioning and uncertainty accompanying the abandonment of previous religious and resource management paradigms and the rise of new authority forms following missionary contact (post-1820).  
  – Numerical and botanical symbolism, combined with character personifications, suggest a layered commentary on loss, renewal, and transformation of power.

• Possible social critique or cautionary element  
  – The statement “this is the day he will die for me” functions as a prophetic judgment, intimating that the causes (head and eyes—the leaders or seers) of vital productivity (uala growth) face imminent demise, a subtle critique of leadership and its consequences for community sustenance.  
  – The mythic elements invite reflection on the fragility of human arrangements over natural cycles, warning perhaps against disrespect or mismanagement of resources and the intangible “eyes” (wisdom, oversight) needed to preserve life.

He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw this and quickly ran and stood at a distant place out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! Here is the short dagger in my hand; it is the tool to cut off your head today, and then your head will be cooked with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat first, and then you will be free.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not listen to these words of Puali‘i, so Puali‘i spoke a second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut off Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head with the short dagger when at that moment Nāmakaokapāo‘o prayed his death prayer for Puali‘i. It was as follows:  
“My beloved eye of my sliced-off region,  
It is craving, it is trembling,  
Whether to eat or to leave,  
Leave it perhaps to Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,  
That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,  
This is my beloved friend,  
Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i,  
Let it be slippery, let it be slippery the eel,  
It is only people and the spear,  
The spear is only with the sheath,  
Nāmakaokapāo‘o will surely die.”","• The narrative depicts an intense confrontation between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o over the sweet potato vines, symbolic perhaps of a struggle for sustenance or authority.  
  – The use of the short dagger (ko‘ilipi) represents not only physical violence but also a metaphorical threat to lineage or mana (spiritual power).  
  – Sweet potatoes (‘uala) are a staple in Hawaiian agriculture and symbolize life and sustenance, thus the act of stabbing vines suggests destruction of life sources, a grave act of hostility.

• The names of the characters carry deep allegorical meaning:  
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o can be broken down as Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o: “The eyes of the puffed or swelling ” or “The many eyes of swelling,” possibly symbolizing vigilance or an enduring watchfulness. The reference to eyes in the death prayer strengthens this symbolism.  
  – Puali‘i, with Pu-a-li‘i, may be interpreted as “The trumpet or sound (pu) of the chief (ali‘i),” aligning him with authority and perhaps a harbinger of judgment or punishment.  
  – Kukui‘aimakaokalani, mentioned in the prayer, combines Kukui (candlenut tree, symbolizing enlightenment and illumination), ai (to eat), maka (eyes), o (of), ka (the), lani (heaven), potentially signifying a divine or higher power overseeing the conflict or a figure of spiritual cleansing.

• The prayer or pule pronounced by Nāmakaokapāo‘o before impending death is rich in metaphor and cultural significance:  
  – The focus on eyes and body parts in the prayer reflects traditional Hawaiian notions of the body and soul as interconnected and the idea of release or transition of the spirit at death (Kanahele, 1986).  
  – The imagery of slippery eel (he‘e) connotes elusiveness and the cyclical nature of life and death, tying to Hawaiian cosmology where the eel is both a real animal and a symbol of transformation (Makālei, 1992).  
  – The repeated notion of “people and spear,” “spear and sheath,” resonates with warfare symbolism and the fragile balance between offense and defense; here, it may allegorize inevitability of death and fate.

• The narrative likely allegorizes a deeper socio-political critique relevant to the Ai Kapu era or the tumultuous period following its abolition in 1819:  
  – The act of cutting and cooking the head (a revered body part) signifies a breach of sacred protocols, possibly reflecting the destabilization of traditional kapu systems and ali‘i authority.  
  – The children’s fear and withdrawal symbolize societal anxiety during transitional phases, as Hawaiian society grappled with new socio-political realities post-contact and early missionary influence.  
  – The invocation of high chiefs and spiritual figures within the prayer suggests a tension between earthly power and spiritual destiny, implicitly critiquing the shifting sands of Hawaiian leadership and cultural erosion in the early 19th century (Kame‘eleihiwa, 1992).

• Numerical symbolism:  
  – The emphasis on the number four in the ‘ehā sweet potato vines may reflect Hawaiian cosmology’s use of four cardinal directions or elements, suggesting the act impacts the entire domain symbolically.  
  – The dual utterances of Puali‘i before Nāmakaokapāo‘o prays correspond to a motif of final chances or warnings given before irreversible destiny, a common narrative device in traditional Hawaiian storytelling (Kanahele, 1986).

• Overall, the passage blends direct narrative with layered allegory to reflect on leadership, spirituality, and cultural upheaval in Hawai‘i’s history, revealing a complex dialogue between tradition and change post-contact.  
  – The ritualistic elements, naming conventions, and poetic prayer all underline the importance of words and acts as carriers of mana and historical memory.  
  – The passage serves as a microcosm of the larger Hawaiian world where authority, spirituality, and survival intertwine, echoing the profound tensions Hawai‘i faced during early 19th-century transformations.

All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Here I will say a little about those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, who were both high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the child, but they came under the authority of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s spiritual power.","• The passage introduces two ali‘i nui (high chiefs), Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, emphasizing their familial relationship as father and child. This immediately situates the narrative within a chiefly genealogical framework, which is foundational in Hawaiian tradition for establishing mana and authority (Kamakau, 1992).

  – The phrase ""he mau ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i"" underscores their elite status, suggesting they represent significant ali‘i lines possibly linked to particular wahi pana (sacred places) or mo‘olelo (stories) on Hawai‘i island.
  – The transition ""ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" indicates a transfer or submission of spiritual authority, which is culturally nuanced. ""Pule"" can mean prayer, ritual, or spiritual domain, here implying that although Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a were chiefly persons, their power was subsumed or influenced by the spiritual force embodied in Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

• Analyzing names reveals layered symbolic meanings connected to natural elements and cosmology:

  – Nāmakaokalani: Nā-maka-o-ka-lani breaks down to “the eyes (maka) of the heavens (lani)”. The eyes here suggest watchfulness or oversight from the celestial realm, aligning with a chiefly figure who observes and governs.
  – Nāmakaokai‘a: Nā-maka-o-kai‘a means “the eyes of the seaweed” or “seaweed’s eyes”. Kai‘a references a type of edible seaweed significant in coastal akua (deity) and resource symbolism, perhaps indicating a connection to oceanic knowledge or liminal spaces between land and sea.
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o: Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, “the eyes of the dark or tumultuous sea” (pāo‘o can refer to choppy ocean conditions), implies a spiritual force associated with the fierce and potentially destructive aspects of the ocean. It may represent a deity or powerful ancestral spirit invoking both respect and fear.

• Allegorically, the passage may represent the dynamic interplay between inherited chiefly power and overarching spiritual authority:

  – The father and child represent the temporal, genealogical power structure (ali‘i lineages), while Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s pule signifies a metaphysical or ritualistic governance that supersedes or regulates chiefly rule.
  – This could reflect historical Hawaiian societal structures where ali‘i mana was legitimized through spiritual sanction by kahuna or familial deity worship, particularly during the Ai Kapu era when strict religious codes governed chiefly conduct (Malo, 1951).
  – The mention of submission “ua komo i loko o ka pule” might subtly critique or highlight the tension between earthly leadership and spiritual control, a theme possibly intensified in post-contact narratives as traditional religious systems faced suppression after 1819 and the subsequent missionary influence after 1820.

• The passage’s focus on eyes (maka) across all names also suggests a motif of vision, oversight, and possibly the transfer or sharing of knowledge and authority:

  – Eyes symbolize awareness and enlightenment in Hawaiian cosmology; hence, their invocation in all names could metaphorically indicate the transmission of ‘viewpoints’ or spiritual insight through generations and across spheres of power.
  – Numerically, there are three names connected in a triadic relationship (father, child, spiritual power), which may symbolize the tripartite Hawaiian concept of ku‘u, ʻike, and mana (foundation, knowledge, and power), implicating a holistic governance system (Beckwith, 1970).

  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o and Puali‘i are not merely individuals but represent opposing forces or deities, possibly embodying elements such as water and land, or spiritual authority and rebellion.
  – The act of Puali‘i cutting the ko‘ilipi—symbolizing a binding or constraint—over Nāmakaokapāo‘o implies a challenge or attempt to break spiritual or social order.
  – The severing and speaking head motif reflects themes found in Hawaiian mo‘olelo (stories) where heads are symbolic seats of mana (spiritual power) and knowledge, suggesting an enduring presence beyond physical death. The dialogue between heads suggests communication beyond ordinary limits, a trope in Hawaiian spiritual narratives.

• Analysis of character names reveals layered meanings enhancing their symbolic value:
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o can be parsed as Nā-maka-o-ka-pā-o‘o, meaning “the eyes of the reef of the ‘o‘o (a digging stick or perhaps a metaphorical tool).” This name evokes vision and vigilance, perhaps personifying a powerful guardian spirit associated with reefs—thresholds between land and sea, known for both protection and danger. In some traditions, Nāmaka is a goddess of the sea, and the extension to ‘okapāo‘o might indicate a specific local or functional aspect of her dominion.
  – Puali‘i breaks down as Pua-Li‘i—“flower of chiefs” or “chiefly blossom,” signaling nobility and high rank but also fragility. As a character, Puali‘i might embody the regal but mortal aspect of leadership, challenged by elemental or divine forces.

• The five-mile measure of Honouliuli’s beach (kai ma kahakai) may have symbolic numerological importance:
  – The number five in Hawaiian cosmology often relates to balance and harmony among elements or directions. The explicit mention of length can signify the vastness of spiritual or physical domains involved in this conflict.
  – Waipouli and Honouliuli as geographic references situate the myth in real Hawaiian landscapes, grounding legendary narrative in tangible places, reflecting the Hawaiian worldview of intertwining land, genealogy, and spirituality.

• Historical and cultural contextualization:
  – The passage’s focus on ritual prayer (pule) and the severing of ko‘ilipi evokes practices related to the Ai Kapu era, where kapu (taboos) and rituals governed social order. The cutting of bindings might symbolize the disruption of kapu or a transition in sacred authority.
  – The motif of a severed, speaking head recalls Hawaiian beliefs in wao akua (realm of gods) and the persistence of mana after corporeal death, possibly reflecting tensions from the early post-contact period (early 19th century) where traditional divine and chiefly orders faced upheaval (notably around the 1819 kapu abolition).
  – The narrative could carry reflective critique or allegory of leadership struggles and spiritual authority during transitional times, perhaps a post-1820 reflection after missionary influence began reshaping societal structures.

• Allegorical and symbolic interpretation:
  – The dialogic encounter between two supernatural figures, one acting aggressively and the other responding from an impossible state, might illustrate the constant balance between destruction and communication, death and dialogue, constraint and liberation.
  – The act of throwing the head into the sea echoes cleansing, release, or dispersal of power, linking back to the ocean’s role as both a life source and boundary.
  – The event signals a cyclical process of challenge, death, renewal, and dialogic presence central to Hawaiian cosmology and leadership paradigms.

In summary, this passage encapsulates a richly layered cosmological and social commentary, using symbolic characters, sacred ritual actions, and geographical references to depict tensions and transformations in Hawaiian spiritual and chiefly domains during a period of cultural flux.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p10,1,10,"A make ‘o Puali‘i, ho‘i akula ‘o   Nāmakaokapāo‘o ā hiki i kona makuahine, iā  Pōka‘ī, noho ihola lāua, ‘a‘ohe ‘ai o   Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ka ‘ai.

At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, was living in Waikīkī. A certain man came from Honouliuli and reached Waikīkī, where the chief resided. He said: “O chief! There is a very strong young child; his father has died, and his head was severed and cast far into the sea, a place very distant, about five miles away. When ‘Ama‘u heard, he said he had strength and could kill him, but he would not do so because the child had no strength.” When he said this in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words.","• This passage symbolically depicts a period of mourning and social displacement following the death of a pivotal figure, Puali‘i, whose death triggers a retreat and fasting by Nāmakaokapāo‘o, indicating ritualistic grief and possibly a spiritual purification process.
  – The refusal to eat (‘a‘ohe ‘ai) by Nāmakaokapāo‘o reflects customary Hawaiian practices of ‘kapu‘ or sacred restrictions during episodes of loss or transition (Kame‘eleihiwa, 1992).
  – The return to Pōka‘i, the mother, emphasizes the matrilineal grounding in Hawaiian society and the restoration of familial and genealogical ties after disruption.

• The interaction between ‘Ama‘u and the child with a severed head carries allegorical weight tied to the concepts of power, vulnerability, and possibly the suppression or downfall of a rival lineage.
  – The name ‘Ama‘u can be broken down as A-ma‘u, roughly “the one who desires” or “longs for,” aligning with a chief’s role in seeking to assert dominance.
  – The severed head symbol (“kiola ‘ia kona po‘o i kai loa”) suggests defeat or death by violence and being cast far at sea metaphorically signals exile or erasure from the community or genealogical memory (Kanahele, 1986).
  – The stated “five miles” (‘elima mile) might function as a numerical riddle or symbolic distance, often linked with the cosmology of land, sea, and mana boundaries in Hawaiian oral narratives (Beckwith, 1970).

• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s name itself is rich in cultural meaning:
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o translates roughly as “the eyes of the mountain cloud,” linking the person to natural elements suggesting watchfulness, divine presence, or spiritual omnipresence.
  – This name positions Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a liminal figure between realms—human, spiritual, and elemental—highlighting his role as witness and participant in socio-political shifts.
  
• The setting of Waikīkī and mention of Honouliuli reflect significant historical loci:
  – Waikīkī as royal residence symbolizes centers of power and customary governance on O‘ahu.
  – Honouliuli, historically a place of refuge or exile, further intensifies the themes of displacement and conflict.
  – This passage plausibly references pre- or early-contact social dynamics marked by chiefly rivalry and shifting allegiances during the Ai Kapu era (pre-1819), but the recording of the narrative in post-contact times introduces interpretive layers influenced by Christian missionary critique of indigenous chiefly violence (Kanahele, 1991).

• The dialogue and narrative embed social commentary on strength and legitimacy:
  – ‘Ama‘u’s refusal to kill the weak child points to Hawaiian values around chiefly authority being contingent on demonstrated strength and legitimacy.
  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o hearing these words suggests a pivotal moment of awareness that may foreshadow future actions or transformations in status.
  – The passage may encode historical memories of political upheaval and the enactment of kapu as means of maintaining or contesting chiefly power.

At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",

When the mother disappeared, she returned to their house at Keahumoa and remained there. Nāmakaokapāo‘o climbed up to the top of the ridge of the house, uncovered the bundles on her back and chest, and lay down precisely in the middle upon the ridge.","• The act of hiding the mother in the cave of Waipouli can be interpreted allegorically as a retreat into secrecy or the subconscious, reflecting traditional Hawaiian notions of wahi pana (sacred places) where mana is preserved or concealed.
  – Caves often serve as liminal spaces in Hawaiian cosmology, associated with birth, death, and spiritual transformation (Malo 1951).
  – Waipouli, meaning “dark water,” symbolizes a place of mystery and possible renewal, consistent with the mother’s disappearance and protection.

• The return to Keahumoa, their hale (house), suggests a restoration of social order or protection of familial lineage after the concealment.
  – Keahumoa translates as ""the gathered/protected,"" emphasizing safety and continuity of ‘ohana (family).
  – This movement might signify the tension between concealment and social presence characteristic of the Ai Kapu era’s complex social norms surrounding family and rank (Kame‘eleihiwa 1992).

• Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a name rich with symbolism and allusion:
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo literally means “the eyes of the enclosure or ridge.”
  – As an entity ‘climbing the ridge,’ she embodies watchfulness and protection from a vantage point, possibly representing a guardian or the observer spirit overseeing the domestic realm.
  – The act of unveiling the mau‘u (bundles) on her back and chest may allegorically reveal concealed knowledge, genealogical secrets, or spiritual baggage, reflecting the layered nature of Hawaiian identity and kapu restrictions on knowledge transmission (Pukui 1983).
  
• Lying precisely in the center of the kaupoku (ridge) has ritual and cosmological significance:
  – The ridgepole is the highest, most sacred part of a hale, symbolizing connection between earth and sky—an axis mundi.
  – Positioning oneself centrally could imply claiming rightful spiritual or chiefly authority, echoing the concept of ‘loko i ke kaula‘i’ (balance at the peak) in Hawaiian spatial and social organization (Kanahele 1986).

• From a historical and post-contact perspective:
  – The narrative’s focus on concealment, secret places, and hidden bundles might metaphorically critique the 1819 abolition of the kapu system and subsequent sociopolitical upheavals.
  – It reflects anxieties about the loss of traditional knowledge and the negotiation of identity amid missionary influence starting around 1820.
  – The use of place names (Waipouli, Keahumoa) grounds the tale in real Hawaiian geography, maintaining connection to ancestral lands amidst shifting cultural landscapes.

• Numerical and riddle-like qualities:
  – Although direct numerical symbolism is not overt here, the repetition of ‘back’ and ‘chest’ bundles suggest dualities (e.g., physical/spiritual, seen/unseen).
  – The precise placement ‘ma waena i luna pono’ (exactly in the center above) implies an emphasis on balance and harmony, universal Hawaiian values in both social and natural worlds (Handy & Pukui 1958).

When they reached the plain of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. As they were ready to leave, Nāmakaokapāo‘o called out from above on the ridge. They heard the voice, but no figure was seen. They asked, “Where are you speaking from?” Nāmakaokapāo‘o replied, “Here I am above.” Eight men climbed up, four from the back of the house, and four from the front, and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Nāmakaokapāo‘o asked, “What is the purpose of your coming?” They answered, “We have come to fight with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a little child like you, strong and a great warrior, who has struck down his father, Puali‘i.”","• The passage allegorically depicts a conflict between established powers and the emergent younger generation or disruptive forces.
  – ‘Ama‘u, as a chief from Waikīkī, symbolizes traditional ali‘i authority seeking to assert dominance through military means.
  – The deployment of four groups of twenty-eight men (totaling 112) may represent the full measure of a large-scale mobilization, with the number 28 often linked to lunar cycles, emphasizing completeness or inevitability in Hawaiian numerology. (Malo 1951)

• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s presence “above on the ridge” while unseen suggests a guardian or supernatural figure inhabiting liminal spaces.
  – Breaking down the name: Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o means “the eyes of the [taro] patches (pāo‘o).” This suggests a watchful, maybe vengeful spirit or deity connected with the land’s sustenance and protection, rather than a mere mortal.
  – The concealment yet vocal presence echoes Hawaiian beliefs about spirits (aumākua) who can observe and influence without manifesting physically. (Kanahele 1999)

• The narrative references a parricide, with Nāmakaokapāo‘o having killed his father Puali‘i.
  – Puali‘i’s name: Pua-li‘i can mean “flower of the chiefs” or “chiefly blossom,” insinuating a fallen nobility or prior generation.
  – The child warrior overthrowing the father can be seen as an allegory for the revolutionary social changes during the late traditional period, such as the waning of old kapu power and the rise of new systems, notably just prior to or around the abolition of the kapu system (Ai Kapu) in 1819.
  – This reflects internal strife and challenges among Hawaiian ali‘i families in the upheaval caused by religious and political transformations post-contact.

• The setting at Keahumoa, a “plain” or “field of abundance,” and the abandoned house could symbolize the decline or void left by the old regime.
  – The warriors’ entering an empty house may allude to the dissolution of traditional power centers or spiritual emptiness felt during times of cultural dislocation, such as after 1819 when many temples (heiau) were abandoned under royal edicts influenced by Kū-ka‘ilimoku and Ka‘ahumanu’s policies.
  – The dual approach of ascending from front and back, each with four men, may point to balanced strategic attack or the integration of opposing forces.

• The passage illustrates typical Hawaiian narrative techniques of riddling imagery and multiple layers of meaning.
  – The unseen voice, the numerical groupings, and the familial conflict encourage understanding beyond the literal, indicative of traditional oral storytelling that encodes historical memory and social critique.
  – Given that the narrative possibly emerged post-contact, the tension between old and new values may subtly critique the upheavals wrought by Western arrival and the missionary presence, which repudiated many indigenous practices.

In sum, this passage uses character archetypes and symbolic actions to comment on a period of intense social and spiritual transformation in Hawaiian history, articulating the struggle between old chiefly orders and emergent forces that redefined Hawaiian society in the early 19th century.","Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, ""Where is that voice coming from?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I'm up here."" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""What in the world are you all doing here?"" They said, ""We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.""","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

When they reached below, Nāmakaokapāo'o struck, and all died except one person, who ran and escaped — that was 'Ama'u at Waikīkī; he spoke of the death of them all, and he was the only one left to listen to.","• This passage describes a confrontation between Nāmakaokapāo'o and an opposing group, culminating in a deadly battle where all but one are killed. Allegorically, this narrative likely represents the triumph of a dominant force or concept (Nāmakaokapāo'o) over a rival or former order.
  – The mention of Ko'olau (windward mountains of O‘ahu) and Waikīkī situates the story within a well-known geographic framework that often symbolizes the division between traditional domains and coastal gateways to change.
  – The battle ending with one survivor who bears witness (‘Ama'u at Waikīkī) suggests the preservation of memory and oral tradition, a common motif in Hawaiian mo‘olelo (stories), emphasizing that despite destruction, knowledge endures.

• The name Nāmakaokapāo'o is deeply symbolic and worthy of etymological analysis.
  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pā-o'o breaks down as ""the eyes of the pāo'o reef"" or ""the eyes of the reef crest,"" which might associate the character with vigilant watchfulness or a protective force tied to the sea.
  – Pāo'o reefs are known for their treacherous surf and hidden dangers, implying that Nāmakaokapāo'o embodies a powerful, perhaps divine or ancestral, force that guards boundaries and enforces order.
  – This figure may invoke the goddess Nāmaka, a sea deity known in Hawaiian tradition for her fierce control of oceanic elements, suggesting an allegory of natural power asserting dominance (Kamakau, 1991).

• The dialogue and outcome reflect a theme common in Hawaiian history and mythology: the inevitable overthrow of old orders by new forces, echoing sociopolitical shifts such as those during the Ai Kapu era and later the significant upheavals post-1819 when kapu system was abolished.
  – The threat: “you will cause us to die, you will not live” may symbolize societal resistance to change, or the fear of annihilation facing traditional groups confronted by transformative powers.
  – The battle could metaphorically represent historical conflicts among ali‘i (chiefs) or between native forces and foreign influences arriving in the early 19th century, with ‘Ama'u as the last survivor representing the continuity of oral tradition amidst cultural loss.
  – The narrative’s emphasis on one remaining listener reflects Hawaiian practices of oral history preservation, where chanting and storytelling maintained knowledge even after conflict or disaster (Maly, 1990).

• The passage can be seen as a social commentary, possibly composed or recorded during the post-contact missionary period when Hawaiian identity was under pressure.
  – The tension between life and death, survival and destruction, may allegorize the Hawaiian people’s struggle to maintain cultural integrity amid rapid Westernization.
  – ‘Ama’u’s role reinforces the responsibility of chanters and historians to bear witness — a subtle assertion of indigenous resilience despite colonization and historical trauma.

  – The war leader ʻAmaʻu, commanding eighteen war canoes (a significant number representing completeness or a full force), initiates a traditional ʻaikapu-era style battle (Kamakau 1964), symbolizing chiefly warfare that establishes dominance through martial prowess.
  – The decisive victory by Nāmakaokapāoʻo and the complete annihilation (""no one left alive"") could reflect historical narratives of conquest or social upheaval, possibly referencing the tumultuous period around Kamehameha I’s unification efforts or metaphorical cleansing of old order.

• The name “Nāmakaokapāoʻo” breaks down into Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo, meaning “The eyes of the prow (of a canoe).”
  – “Nā-maka” (the eyes) suggests keen vision or foresight, a common metaphor for leadership and strategic acuity.
  – “Ka pāoʻo” (the prow) refers to the front of a canoe, a symbol of guided movement and pioneering—metaphorically a leader steering her people.
  – Thus, Nāmakaokapāoʻo personifies a visionary chief or spiritual force guiding Oʻahu’s fate, embodying the island’s protective and militaristic spirit in lore.

• ʻAmaʻu has connotations of “moss” or “dampness,” something that might symbolically represent stagnation or an older, fading power challenged by the fresh strength of Nāmakaokapāoʻo.
  – The name suggests a natural element susceptible to being overcome, reinforcing the allegory of old order vanquished by a new emerging force.

• The narrative context aligns with the late pre-contact to early post-contact periods, marked by interisland warfare culminating in unification (circa late 18th to early 19th century).
  – The scale of conflict using war canoes and total destruction echoes the last vestiges of the ʻaikapu era’s chiefly warfare system prior to 1819, when significant social changes, including the abandonment of the kapu system, occurred.
  – After conquest, Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s appearance to her mother and installment over Oʻahu may allegorize the legitimization process of new rulership through genealogy and spiritual authority, critical in Hawaiian chiefly tradition (Kamakau 1961).

• The encompassing of all Oʻahu by Nāmakaokapāoʻo points symbolically to unification and stabilization after chaos, a motif found in many Hawaiian moʻolelo reflecting social memory of conquest and political transformation.
  – This also serves as implicit social commentary: the necessity of strong, strategic leadership (visionary “eyes of the prow”) to bring order, likely reflecting post-contact Hawaiian societal restructuring influenced by missionary and Western governance models.","When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
