There was no one like him in all the islands from Hawaiʻi to Niʻihau in terms of his small size and great courage. His father was Kauluakahaʻi from Kahikipapaialewa, which is a land in Kahikinuʻu. His mother was Pōkaʻī. His father was a high chief of Kahikipapaialewa and also part god.","**Paragraph 1:**

• This paragraph follows the classic Hawaiian *moʻolelo* opening structure, where foundational information about the protagonist is established early on to set the tone and cosmological context of the character’s origin and nature.

– The protagonist’s full name is **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo** (The Eyes of the Pāoʻo Fish), suggesting aquatic or supernatural connections; pāoʻo fish are freshwater fish (sometimes called ""grubs"" or ""eels"" in English) associated with liminal spaces, especially fresh and salt water convergence points such as *ʻauwai* and *wahi kapu*. In Hawaiian cosmology, the *pāoʻo* holds totems of persistence, transformation, and spiritual guidance.

• The description of Nāmakaokapāoʻo as *he keiki ‘u‘uku loa* (a very little child) and *he keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio* (a very strong child in his youth) immediately establishes a paradox inherent to many *moʻolelo akua* (mythological stories): a youth who possesses extraordinary physical or spiritual power beyond their years or apparent limitations.

– The phrase *a he keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio* reflects an archetype of exceptional youth or *keiki akua* (child of divine descent) and may also reference the tradition of *keiki kanu*—a child planted in sacred soil, divinely blessed, who grows with spiritual might.

• The storyteller emphasizes that *‘aʻohe ona ʻelua ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawaiʻi ā Niʻihau, i ka ‘uʻuku a me ke koa loa* (“not another like him existed in all the islands from Hawaiʻi to Niʻihau, in terms of smallness and great bravery”)—a spatial and cultural framing typical in ancient narratives to establish a hero’s supremacy.

– The geographic range named, from *Hawaiʻi* to *Niʻihau*, spans the Hawaiian archipelago, implying that Nāmakaokapāoʻo's reputation transcended local borders. Such wide recognition is characteristic of those descended from both divine (*akua*) and chiefly (*aliʻi*) lineages.

**Naming and genealogy (Kupuna and place names):**

• **Kaulu-a-Kahaʻi** – a genealogical reference to Kahaʻi, a renowned culture hero in Polynesian oral tradition and pan-Pacific genealogical anchor in places including Moʻorea, Hawaiʻi, and Rarotonga.

– *Kau-lu-a-Kahaʻi* may be translated as “The thread entwined with Kahaʻi” or “The inspiration of Kahaʻi,” again linking Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s lineage to a celestial prototype, namely Kahaʻi. In some traditions, Kahaʻi is a voyager-demigod who went to *Kahiki* to retrieve sacred or sustaining gifts, such as *ʻulu* (breadfruit) and healing rituals. He’s also often closely tied to oceanic navigation and healing gods such as *Kāne*, *Kanaloa*, and *Hema*, which is crucial for understanding Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s story.

• The land **Kahiki-papa-ialewa** is a place within **Kahikinuʻu**, both being place names with deep esoteric resonance, often associated with *Kahiki* (the homeland of the gods or ancestral homeland).

– These places are part of the symbolic geography in *moʻo*, *moʻolelo pule*, and *moʻo kanu* (birth chants) that situate ancestors within a spiritual and cosmic framework—not just a terrestrial one.

• The maternal line is stated with equal importance, offering the mother’s name: **Pō-kaʻī**.

– Feminine naming conventions often reflect poetic or cosmological positioning. *Pō-kaʻī* might translate as “Night that comes upon the high chief” or “the royal night,” signaling the presence of *mana wahine* that flows vertically into Nāmakaokapāoʻo.

• The father is described as *he aliʻi nui... no Kahikipapaialewa*, and then further elevated with *he ʻaoʻao akua kekahi ona* (part god was he).

– The phrase *he aliʻi nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa* firmly roots Nāmakaokapāoʻo in *mana aliʻi* and provides divine lineage. That he is also described as *he ʻaoʻao akua* (part god) suggests the child is not merely a high chief’s offspring but one of *kāula* or *akua* descent, akin to Pele, Kamapuaʻa, or Laka.

• The text provides genealogical, physical, and cosmological identity in one breath, ensuring that the *audience* can immediately understand that Nāmakaokapāoʻo exists in the liminal space of demi-divinity—a child between realms, destined for heroic acts.

– This structure encodes *moʻolelo* as pedagogical tools, not merely entertainment; they teach concepts of *lineage (moʻokūʻauhau)*, *geography (moʻolele ʻāina)*, and *spiritual cosmology (moʻopuna nui)*.

– We may interpret Nāmakaokapāoʻo as a continuation of Kahaʻi’s mythic line, and perhaps even as a re-embodiment of the pre-contact hero-type, who straddles the old world (*ʻai kapu*) and a shift toward change that the myth will dramatize allegorically.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","Chapter 1 of the Nāmakaokapāoʻo narrative presents a formative mytho-historical episode that encapsulates the tensions between indigenous cosmology, kinship structures, and emergent hierarchies in pre-colonial Hawai‘i. At its core, the narrative establishes Nāmakaokapāoʻo as a demigod-like figure, born through a union of divine and noble lineage—his father Kauluakahaʻi, a high chief and part deified being, and his mother Pōkaʻī, whose reproductive act becomes a site of contention and violence in the text. The story is thematically rich in its engagement with identity, legitimacy, and physical power as instruments of control and cultural dominance, particularly through the symbolic relationship between place, progeny, and spiritual authority.

The narrative begins with the figure of Nāmakaokapāoʻo as a prodigious child of diminutive size but extraordinary strength, an archetype often found in Polynesian narratives that valorize mana—spiritual potency and physical prowess concentrated in a singular individual. His birthplace, Hōʻaeʻae in 'Ewa, is significant as it situates the myth within a well-established genealogical and geographic lexicon of O’ahu. The transmission of power from lineage to lineage is highlighted through the invocation of ancestral names and places, such as Kahikipapaialewa and Kahikinuʻu, which are more than mere settings; they are symbols of tribal affiliation and spiritual inheritance, a common trait in oral epics designed to reinforce land tenure and legitimacy through cosmogonic narrative.

Puali‘i’s intrusion upon Pōkaʻī’s domestic life represents an incursion upon both maternal authority and generational continuity, marked not only by his desire to usurp the mother but also to override the preexisting familial structure. This theme finds resonance in broader Hawaiian and Oceanic mythology, where conflict often emerges from challenges to existing kinship hierarchies and the sanctity of reproductive autonomy. Puali‘i’s declaration that he will eat Nāmakaokapāoʻo's head ""with sweet potato"" alludes to ritualistic violence, a complex motif that may harken to early Hawaiian kapu (taboo) systems wherein the consumption of flesh—literal or symbolic—was a proxy for spiritual absorption or annihilation of the Other.

Of central importance is the recurring motif of sweet potato cultivation and destruction, particularly the field of Nāmakaokapāoʻo itself. The field's endurance ""until this day"" suggests both a physical and metaphorical topography—evidence of a myth-making strategy that embeds orally transmitted lore within observable, local places to strengthen its claims to authenticity and temporal continuity. The invocation of two ancestral deities, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻa, further situates the narrative within the discourses of lineage and legitimacy. By summoning them in a death chant, Nāmakaokapāoʻo aligns himself with divine ancestry and asserts spiritual domination over the aggressor, ultimately turning ritual insult into fatal retribution.

The motif of metamorphic justice—wherein violence serves as both purification and reaffirmation of sacred power—culminates in the decapitation of Puali‘i and the subsequent transformation of his head into an oracle. This moment complicates the Western notion of violence as purely destructive; in contrast, the Māori and Hawaiian contexts often view ritual violence as an engine of knowledge transmission, and the disembodied head becomes a locus of prophecy and ancestral voice. The placement of Pualiʻi’s head into the coastal cave of Waipouli further connects the narrative to wahi pana (sacred places), affirming the deep interweaving of geography, mythology, and political memory in Hawaiian oral literature.

The subsequent response by ‘Ama‘u, another chief from Waikīkī, underscores the political dimensions of the narrative. ‘Ama‘u's decision to deploy military force—a fleet of eighteen war canoes—reflects the militarized hierarchy that characterized Hawaiian society during the pre-unification era. Yet rather than portraying Nāmakaokapāoʻo as a mere destroyer, the story elevates him as a unifier, consolidating control over O‘ahu, mirroring the consolidations of later rulers such as Kamehameha I. His act of relocating his mother to a new polity may symbolize the re-centering of female agency within a new chieftaincy framework.

The publication history and textual variation of this narrative—particularly its appearance in the *Ka Nūpepa Kūʻokoʻa* and *Ke Alakaʻi o Hawaiʻi*—suggests that while the core motifs are indigenous and pre-contact in nature, the serialized versions may have undergone subtle shifts aligned with post-contact anxieties. Its emergence in print in the 1890s follows a familiar pattern of mythopoeic reconstruction during periods of political upheaval. The recurrence of the name ""Nāmakaokapāoʻo"" in textual form post-1894, after a noticeable absence in earlier archival records, raises questions regarding its invention or reinvention as a vehicle for commentary on colonial dominance and native resistance. The correlation between the protagonist’s supernatural status and his literal annihilation of rivals could have allegorical resonance, especially when viewed against the backdrop of the 1893 overthrow and the subsequent U.S.-backed regime.

Its emphasis on matrilineal loyalty (e.g., Nāmakaokapāoʻo protecting Pōkaʻī while rejecting the authority of a non-divine stepfather) may also serve as a coded repudiation of imposed Western patriarchal values and the destabilization of traditional kinship models. Furthermore, the story's elevation of the small yet all-powerful child hero subverts colonial narratives of fragility and inferiority imposed upon Native Hawaiians at the turn of the century.

As with other Hawaiian literary revivals in the print medium, the narrative functions simultaneously as cultural preservation and encoded resistance. The serialization in Hawaiian-language newspapers—a medium of political discourse as well as cultural conservation—adds another layer of political intent, especially when one considers the allegiance shifts of certain publications like *Ka Nūpepa Kūʻokoʻa* post-1893. The placement of violence within an ancient mythic framework may have been intentionally used to critique contemporary forms of violence—namely statecraft by force, cultural erasure, and governance through occupation—under the guise of historical allegory.

In sum, the chapter is a profound and layered account, rich in metaphorical and structural symbolism. It foregrounds the archetypal demigod hero who embodies both the mana of the land and the unyielding will of the people. The story resists simplistic readings of indigenous myth as entertainment or primitive narrative. Rather, it presents a textured discourse on sovereignty, legitimacy, and identity—narratives powerfully relevant not only to pre-contact Hawaiian cosmology, but also to the indigenous epistemic resistance that followed colonial intrusion. Its thematic resonance, spatial references, and mythic register render it a critical artifact in the study of Hawaiian oral literatures and their contested afterlives in the colonial press."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Pōka‘ī carried Nāmakaokapāo‘o in her body, Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, and Pōka‘ī remained with her pregnancy until she gave birth. In this birthing, Pōka‘ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were exceedingly joyful and elated.","**Paragraph 2:**

• This paragraph gives the very beginnings of Nāmaka-o-ka-pāo'o’s life — in the sacred process of conception, gestation, and birth — placing it squarely within the traditional Hawaiian cosmology that honors procreation, genealogy (kupuna kīlaula), and the spiritual dimension of birth as an act that brings new life into the world and continues ancestral lines.

• The opening sentence states:  
– *‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o*.  
This locates the act of conception in **Hō‘ae‘ae**, a place in **'Ewa**, on the island of O'ahu.  
– Hō‘ae‘ae: hyphenation possible: *Hō-‘ae‘ae* (the act of leaping/looming, perhaps referencing sea spray or wind leaping over the land). The name could also suggest a meeting of waters or a sacred place where generations were born and raised. The naming of this location ties the child-to-be directly to the land (and its mana) as is typical of Hawaiian genealogical narrations.  
– This naming of the land where conception occurred is of cultural significance — often, the place of conception or birth directly informs the spiritual strength or life work of the child. Just as the divine child **Kāne-milo-hāna** was conceived at Pā-lā-ke-o-ka-hana-kōlili, the location of birth can foreshadow destiny.

• The names of the parents are once again reiterated in a more personal context — not merely genealogical identification, but a moment of union:
– **Pōka‘ī**: the mother of Nāmaka-o-ka-pāo‘o. The name can be translated as *Pō* (night, spiritual realm) and *ka‘ī* (to lead, to take charge, to bear or carry forth). Thus, Pō-ka‘ī could mean: “The night carries forth” or “Led by the night.” In Hawaiian cosmology, ""night"" is associated with the spirit world and mana. Therefore, this name may symbolize her role as a conduit for a child of spiritual or prophetic significance.  
– **Kauluakaha‘i**, the father, returns to his place. The name is composed of **Kaulua** (the inspiration or breath of life), and **Kaha‘i** (a famed ancestor and voyager, possibly borrowed from the Samoan-Hawaiian cultural memory — see Pukui & Elbert). Kaulu-aka-ha‘i: “The breath or stirring for Ha‘i (or Hema)” — Hema being a motif in Hawaiian storytelling, a father figure of Pā‘ao, Nāmaka, and Kaulu’s own son, Manokalanipo, who also had supernatural strength. Thus, this name places the character within a lineage of demi-divine figures who traversed and mediated between worlds — earthy and spiritual. That he returns to his own land (*noho i kona ‘āina*) suggests a thematic arc of native Hawaiian narrative — the father belongs to a realm that the child must one day return to, likely for instruction, trial, or revelation.  

• The act of *launa kino me ka moe ‘ana iho* (union of bodies in copulation leading to conception) is succinct but purposeful. It is not sexualized in a taboo way, but rather framed as a necessary and sacred event leading to birth, which was greatly celebrated in Hawaiian tradition, especially when the child carried strong bloodlines or prophesied greatness.

• The process of *hāpai* (to carry, to be pregnant) of Pōka‘ī and her remaining steadfast (*noho iho*) until birth is emphasized as a **heroic and spiritual act**:
– “Noho ihola ‘o Pōka‘ī me kona hāpai” – this phrasing suggests her physical endurance, but also the idea that she bore the child not only in body but in *mana* and in prophecy.  
– That Pōka‘ī and her child were exceedingly joyful (*he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki*) — *‘ilihune* is a strong word, denoting elation, rapture, jubilation. It may imply a recognition of the cosmic importance of the child, the *ho'omanawanui* (joyous expectation) typical in the birth of aliʻi or prophesied chiefs.  
– This joyful celebration of birth might symbolize the coming of a figure who would disrupt existing power structures or cultural norms — perhaps a cultural metaphor for a new age beyond the rigid 'Ai Kapu tradition.  
– The 'Ai Kapu era, which governed the behavior and rituals around men and women, food, and procreation, would have dictated rules governing how and when a woman could eat when pregnant and how the birth itself would be attended to in ritual. Although not detailed in this passage, the exclamation of joy may suggest the fulfillment of an expected event, perhaps amid challenges or prophetic expectation.

• The absence of ritual or *īao* or *waihui* (consecration rites) in this passage hints that this might be early in the cultural timeline, or that the narrative is stylized to focus on the lineage itself rather than religious rite. It could also suggest a move away from the complexity of ritual, reflecting the character’s potential role in cultural transformation.

• The passage begins to craft a mythic lineage across land and spirit:
– The child’s birth is tied to a land (*Hō‘ae‘ae* in *'Ewa*), implying a rootedness to the *aina* and the *mana* of that place.
– His mother is from the *pō* (spirit, ancestors) and his father is connected to Kaha‘i and the *moana* (sea/foreign lands) — a spiritual traveler and cultural mediator. This synthesis of dualities (land and ocean, internal and external, pō and ao) is typical of *kanaka ‘ōī'ī* (prophetic and extraordinary individuals) in Hawaiian *moʻolelo aloha aina* (traditional legend).

**Summary**:  
This paragraph functions as a **spiritual etiology** — not only of the physical birth of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, but of the genealogical, cosmological, and cultural forces that shape the identity and purpose of a future cultural or mythic figure. By naming the land, the union, and the emotion of the mother and child, the moʻolelo sets up Nāmaka-o-ka-pāo'o’s life as one infused with mana, destined to interact with both *āina* and *ākua*, and to navigate between realms of power, law, and transformation.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

He visited the home of Pōka‘i and, having seen her, fell in love with her. He said to her, ""I desire you to be my wife."" Pōka‘i replied, ""How could you ever want me? I have already borne a child, and my body is no longer as it was."" Puali‘i replied, ""Those things are of no consequence. If you desire me, then let us lie together as husband and wife."" Pōka‘i agreed, and went off with her new husband Puali‘i to live in the plains of Keahumoa.","**Paragraph 3:**

• A new character is introduced: **Pua-li‘i (child/descendant of a chief or of chiefs)**, described as a ""good man"" (*kanaka maika‘i*) from Līhu‘e — a district located inland of Wāhiāwā on the island of O‘ahu. His name, Pua-li‘i, may be interpreted as ""*flower (or child) of the chief*,"" signifying noble lineage or qualities. As will be confirmed later in the tale, he is a man of character, strength, and resolve. He is described as coming from the inland (*no Līhu‘e*) and arriving by the shore (*ma kai o Honouliuli*), which is likely Honouliuli in the district of ‘Ewa on O‘ahu — a historically and culturally significant coastal region. This location connects him to the land and sea, and in Hawaiian tradition, those who traverse both regions — *ma uka a ma kai* — are considered balanced (*pono*) and often protagonists of significant tales.

– The first movement of Pua-li‘i brings him to the shore (*ka lawai‘a ma kai*) — likely fishing, though the word “lawai‘a” can imply a broader purpose, including exploration of the coast as a kanaka maika‘i (virtuous and capable man). The fact that he “visits the house” (*kipa maila*) of Pōka‘i is consistent with ancient Hawaiian customs: In the **pre-contact period**, it was customary for travelers to visit homes of locals for food, water, and shelter, and it was considered both *pono* and a display of hospitality (*aloha*) to provide such. Pōka‘i receiving Pua-li‘i in her home aligns with this traditional value, and it is in this natural, everyday setting that the seeds of love are sown.

• The verb “nānā” (to look at, to examine, to regard with interest) is significant in this context. When Pua-li‘i “nānā akula iā Pōka‘i,” it suggests more than a glance; it is an act of *recognition* — potentially mystical or fate-driven. In many mo‘olelo Hawai‘i (Hawaiian narratives), seeing someone and being moved to love is not merely romantic impulse, but a narrative device indicating divine or ancestral intervention in human affairs. The use of **makemake** (to desire, to love) that follows is direct and unwavering: he expresses his desire for Pōka‘i to be his *wahine* (wife, lover, long-term companion). This expression is immediate, not gradual, another motif commonly found in *mo‘olelo* where attraction and decision occur in rapid succession, symbolizing certainty and destiny.

• Pōka‘i responds with self-doubt and self-deprecation, citing two clear reasons: (1) she has already given birth to a child (Nāmakaokapāo‘o), and (2) her body is “no longer as it was” (*ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino*), implying that childbirth has changed her physical form, perhaps post-partum scarring, weight loss or gain, or other markers of motherhood. This self-characterization stands in contrast to the usual idealized portrayals of female beauty in *mo‘olelo Hawai‘i*, where heroines like Pele, Namaka, or Hi‘iaka are often described as *na mōhinu o ka lani*, the heavenly beauties of the sky. Pōka‘i's words are humble and revealing of **postpartum self-perception** in traditional society — a psychological nuance that is often underrepresented in high epic tales.

– Puali‘i’s counter — “He mea ‘ole ia mau mea” — affirms that status as a mother does not devalue her in his eyes. It also emphasizes the **non-physical dimensions of desire** in relationships, which extends beyond kānaka to include *aloha ‘āina* (love of land) and *aloha akua* (love of gods/ancestors). The phrase “e moe kāua” (“let us lie together”) is a clear sexual proposition in polite, yet culturally appropriate, language. In older *moʻolelo*, “e moe” functions both literally and metaphorically — sometimes describing union, sometimes a spiritual unification or binding of destinies.

• Their union is not immediately accepted by the community, as will be revealed in later chapters, which heightens the narrative tension. However, in this passage, the immediate outcome is her assent: “ʻAe akula ‘o Pōka‘i.” She chooses to go with Pua-li‘i to Keahumoa (*Ke-ahu moa*, possibly meaning ""the heap (or gathering) of the chicken"") — a place-name with likely symbolic resonance. Some scholars suggest Keahumoa refers to a stretch of land in the Waikele or Waiawa regions of central O‘ahu, near Wāhiāwā.

– The relocation to Keahumoa marks a **transition** — Pōka‘i leaves her past with Nāmakaokapāo‘o behind and aligns her fate with Pua-li‘i’s. Migration or movement to a new area is common in Hawaiian storytelling, often signifying a pivotal life choice or a shift in social status.

– Given the cultural weight of movement (*ho‘i aku*), especially for women, and the implications of shifting allegiance (*aloha kāne*) from one man to another — especially in an *ʻAi Kapu* society — this narrative moment likely carries **symbolic cultural tensions**. It may be interpreted as a **subversion** or **challenge** to rigid ‘Ai Kapu ideologies that regulated gender roles and sexual relationships, particularly post-partum. By accepting Pua-li‘i, Pōka‘i exercises agency and affirms the right of women to claim sovereignty over their own lives and desires.

• Etymologically, the name **Pō-ka‘i** — literally “night has journeyed” — captures the notion of passage through time, solitude (pō = night, darkness), and spiritual journeying. She is a figure of quiet strength, emerging from emotional and physical solitude into a new life with Pua-li‘i. Her choice represents **transformation**, and her character arc may serve as an allegory for broader post-Ai Kapu societal changes — that is, integration of the old (*pō*) with the new (*ka‘i* = to lead, to journey forward).

– This early episode in the story also supports what appears to be a thematic **antagonism** yet to be fully revealed between Pua-li‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o — who will grow to despise his stepfather, eventually embodying chaos and danger in contrast to Pua-li‘i’s order and masculinity. Their conflict may echo broader mythological dichotomies such as **Kāne vs. Kanaloa**, or **Pākā vs. Kāne**, where the cosmic battle between order and chaos plays out through human or divine figures.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.","**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;",

As he was planting the sweet potatoes, Puali‘i spoke his incantation, saying, ""Behold, now the head of the ulua and the sweet potato are united; let Puali‘i eat first, and then the noa may eat, his wife Pōkā‘ī and the other items. Therefore, Puali‘i descended to the coast of Honouliuli to fish in the sea along with the sweet potato harvest.""","**Paragraph 4 Commentary:**

• This paragraph describes Nāmakaokapāo'o’s settlement and agricultural activity, emphasizing the enduring nature of his labor as symbolized by his two large, named sweet potato patches. Their continued existence ""until this day"" suggests a tradition of ancestral land stewardship and the association of these plots with his name speaks to the practice of *kūkā o wahi*—marking or naming land in accordance with deeds, lineage, or significance. 

– *Mahilo āna māla ‘uala lō‘ihi*: The repetition and significance of the number two (the two māla, the two parents, the duality of god and man) suggests a deeper mythic structure. Sweet potato (*ʻuala*) is sacred in Hawaiian cosmology, often associated with *ʻāina* (land) and *nahele* (forest), and is also linked to deities like Lono. The planting of ʻuala often included *ho'okupu* and *kāli*, rites of first fruits and blessings to Lonoikamakahiki, god of fertility and peace.  
– *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo* (""the eyes of the pāoʻo fish""): Again, the name integrates *maka* (""eye"") which is highly symbolic in Hawaiian worldview, representing mana (spiritual power) and intelligence. The “pāoʻo” (rock-mullet or small fish) also carries sacred symbolism since fish were often intermediaries between humans and gods in Hawaiian thought, particularly in substitutions of human for divine offerings (e.g., *ulua* for *poʻo*). The substitution of fish for human sacrifice is revisited below in Pualiʻi’s incantation.

• The incantation spoken by Pualiʻi while planting ʻuala is of deep cultural interest:  
– *“Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ʻuala, a ʻai ‘o Pualiʻi, a laila, noa, ʻai kāna wahine…”*  
• This passage is rich in symbolic ritual language, particularly within the context of the *'Ai Kapu* system. Pualiʻi places himself within a sacred framework by claiming first rights to eat after the planting—before *noa* categories (common people), including his wife and possessions.

– The pairing of *ke poʻo o ka ulua me ka ʻuala* (""the head of the ulua and the sweet potato"") is a metaphor that inverts the traditional religious practice. The head of the ulua was typically presented to the aliʻi or placed on the altar as part of the *hoʻokupu*, especially in times when human sacrifice was ritually substituted with ulua to feed Lono at the *heiau*. Here, the ʻuala (a symbol of the commoner and human sustenance) is joined with the head of the fish in a sort of pairing of sustenance – food for gods, food for humans – yet Pualiʻi consumes first, before his wife and the *noa*, indicating his claim to inherited authority.

• Pualiʻi then returns to Honouliuli to fish with intent to eat it together with ʻuala, echoing the structure of offerings from sea and land. This mirrors the ritualistic pairing of *he aloha ‘āina, he aloha kai* (love of the land, love of the sea) – a common reframing of sustenance in Hawaiian chants and narratives.

– *Honouliuli* (literally: ""dark bay"") is not just a geographic setting but symbolically tied to darkness, mystery, and the liminality of cultural transformation. It is also the namesake of a WWII-era internment camp for Japanese Americans in Oʻahu, showing continuity of layered cultural meanings in place naming.

– It is likely that this passage sets up an allegorical tension between the old ways of 'Ai Kapu (with Pualiʻi expressing a desire to consume according to traditional hierarchy and sacrificial substitution) and the new era (emerging through Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s defiance against control and ritual constraint, to be revealed in later passages). This tension may represent a metaphor for transitional phases of Hawaiian religious and social transformation.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",

At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went with ten young boys to Puali‘i's sweet potato patches. Nāmakaokapāo‘o at this time was very small, only two spans and a half of height, his body thin, not yet sturdy. Upon arriving at the sweet potato patches, he called out to the boys, 'Uproot the mounds entirely along with the vines on top, leaving none to grow again.' But the boys were fearful, so they only superficially heaped up the sweet potatoes without actually uprooting the mounds.""","**Paragraph 5:**

• This paragraph continues to establish the early deeds of **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o** (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish), detailing an incident at Puali‘i's sweet potato patches and illustrating the young boy's precocious character as well as the dynamic between him and other children around him. His leadership and confidence are starkly at odds with his physically diminutive stature.

• **Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s physique described** with the phrase *he kino ‘u‘uku loa*—a ""very small body"", *‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa*— ""two spans and a half"" in height (approximately 3.5 feet or so, using the traditional Hawaiian unit of measurement: a span is roughly 9 inches), and *‘a‘ole i pa‘a kona ma‘i*—his thighs were not yet strong or firm. This emphasizes the paradox of a physically small boy who nonetheless exudes strength, confidence, and supernatural energy.

– This motif of a small, seemingly unimposing figure who is in fact extraordinarily strong appears in multiple traditions across Polynesia, including the stories of Pele, Kamapuaʻa, and Māui. In kanaka maoli cosmology, smallness of form often symbolizes great mana (spiritual power) or ʻaumakua-like qualities—power that works from beneath the surface, subtly and decisively.

• The **group of ten young boys (he ‘umi kumamāhiku)** accompanies Nāmakaokapāo‘o to the patches, suggesting that even at this young age, he is a leader among his peers. The number ten may hold symbolic or ritual meaning—ten is known as a sacred number in Polynesian traditions, often associated with completeness or a ceremonial quorum (e.g., in chants, offerings, or trials).

• Upon arrival at the patches, **Nāmakaokapāo‘o commands the boys**: *E huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala ā pau loa i luna, mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana*—""Uproot the heaps along with the sweet potato leaves completely from above, leaving none to grow again.""  

– Huhuki is a powerful verb meaning to uproot, tear out, or destroy. It is often used in kānāwai (Hawaiian law), hula, and mo‘olelo to indicate forceful, symbolic destruction or transformation. The act of uprooting could be symbolic of overturning an old order—possibly a metaphor for the future dismantling of the ‘Ai Kapu system and the birth of a new socio-religious paradigm.

– The command includes *mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana*—""do not leave one to grow again""—a phrase that intensifies the seriousness and finality of the act, and might symbolize a cleansing of the spiritually corrupt or oppressive practices of the past. We see this again in Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s future battles with Kānemilohā and other guardians of the old ways.

• In contrast to Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s clear directive, the **ten boys are described as makāhelehele** (nervous, fearful)—conforming to expected behavior under the strict social norms of the *ʻAi Kapu* era, where even speaking out of turn could bring dire consequences. Consequently, *kāohi mālie nō ma ka ʻuala*—""they only superficially heaped up the sweet potatoes""—without actually carrying out the full command.

– This echoes larger cultural tensions between those who strictly adhered to ancient kapu and those who, often through divine or semi-divine right, challenged or defied those restrictions. Nāmakaokapāo‘o may be portrayed as a force of kālai kapu (breaker of kapu), whether literally or symbolically.

– The narrative seems to associate Nāmakaokapāo‘o with kālai kapu themes, especially in later episodes. Here, in this early phase, he is issuing commands that challenge the integrity of someone else’s property (Pualiʻi, who at other points appears antagonistic), a sort of proto-sacrilege that may foreshadow deeper ritual actions later on.

• Given that **Puali‘i is likely Nā’malama’s descendant of a priestly or chiefly line**, his sweet potato patches symbolically link to land stewardship, spiritual duty, and potentially mana transfer. That a child—albeit a powerful one—commands their destruction could be a metaphor for cosmological change or ritual reordering by those deemed supernaturally sanctioned.

– Sweet potato (ʻuala) was a prime food in Hawaiian cosmology, associated with fertility, sustenance, and the land's mana. Its connection to the god Lono is especially strong (as in the Makahiki cycle), and disturbing it may have ritualistic significance—especially if it serves as a symbol of an old kapu order being disrupted.

**Name Etymologies:**

• **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o** — ""The eyes of the pāo'o (longtail fish)""  
  – The use of *pāoʻo* may symbolically invoke sharpness, slenderness, and stealth—qualities often ascribed to the fish and which transfer metaphorically to the character's physical build and character traits. It also evokes the pāoʻo of the gods, such as the hook used in the fishing up of lands, possibly linking Nāmakaokapāo‘o to ancestral oceanic mythologies.

  – The suffix *-ka-pāo‘o* may also linguistically echo *-ka-poʻo* (head, chief), subtly linking him to leadership and suggesting that his “eyes” are those of insight and vision—perhaps a prophet-like figure.

• **Puali‘i** — ""Perhaps “floating like a moʻo,” or “desirous of land,” from *pua* (blossom, fragment) and *li‘i* (small) — indicating a younger male of influence, possibly a petty chief or priest. In some narratives, he represents the kahiko (ancient) world of old ways—especially as a foil to Nāmakaokapāo‘o. His role in these passages aligns with characters who resist change or hold tightly to authority rooted in kapu and lineage.

• **Tentative Allegorical Interpretation:**

– This passage can be interpreted allegorically as a symbolic disruption of the kapu system. The patches symbolize entrenched traditions—sacred food resources maintained by the male priesthood. Nāmakaokapāo‘o, possibly representing a new order or divine force, seeks a complete rupture, while the ten boys, who are not yet divinely appointed, stand as representatives of society—hesitant and fearful of breaking the established order.

– Given that this chapter is early in the narrative, it may foreshadow larger spiritual confrontations and the eventual transformation of Hawaiian cosmological thought that Nāmakaokapāoʻo is understood to have catalyzed.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then, Nāmakaokapāoʻo returned and lit a fire and roasted several stalks of sweet potato on the fire that was burning. While he was roasting them over the fire, his stepfather came in quickly, arriving, and asked his mother, Pōkaʻī: ""No."" Pualiʻi said: ""Yes, his head and eyes are what I will eat with my sweet potato today, and therefore this is the day I shall kill him.""","**Paragraph 6:**
• The passage is deeply symbolic and likely allegorical, consistent with Hawaiian oral tradition's practice of encoding moral, political, and cultural lessons in narrative form.  
• The first section describes Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo’s action of destroying two sweet potato patches—**māla ‘uala**—by tearing them up entirely and stacking one on top of the other until the leaves formed heaps (kanahā āhua). The imagery of tearing up the crops may represent rebellion against subsistence norms or agricultural law, possibly a metaphor for rejecting or threatening the foundations of traditional food customs (like the 'Ai Kapu restrictions).  
• The number **“kanahā āhua” (forty heaps)** may not be literal but symbolic. In Hawaiian cosmology, large round numbers often symbolize abundance and mana (spiritual power), and **forty** could represent a threshold of maturity or transformation, suggesting this act marks a defining shift in the protagonist’s behavior or life status.  
• Nāmakaokapāoʻo then roasts **‘ehā ‘au o ka ‘uala** (four vines of the sweet potato) on a fire **(kapuahi e ‘ā ana)**. Fire rituals were central to traditional Hawaiian religious practice, and the act of roasting food can be priestly, or in this case, subtly subversive if done outside sanctioned contexts or under the instruction of inappropriate authority (such as a child performing adult rites).  
• While cooking, **Pua-(a)liʻi**, his stepfather, returns and asks Pōkaʻī if the child Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo prepared food with him (“'Aʻole""), and she replies “no.” – This exchange shows adherence to Hawaiʻi's **hospitality customs** of inquiring about the food and sharing it with others, particularly with elders or household members.  
• Pualiʻi then replies, “Yes, his head and eyes shall be the food to go with my sweet potato today. Therefore, today is the day I will kill him.” – This is a **threat of human sacrifice or metaphorical condemnation**, but it is laden with **double meanings** relevant to Hawaiian cosmology and agricultural symbolism.  

– The **“poʻo” (head)** and **“maka” (eyes)** referenced here symbolize authority, perception, and spiritual power. The stepfather’s desire to eat Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s head and eyes symbolically suggests a desire to consume or destroy the child’s power, identity, and insight — a metaphor for silencing change or dismissing youthful disruption to the old ways.  
– Pualiʻi eating Nāmakaokapāoʻo's “head” and “eyes” alludes to ritual sacrifice. In this context, Nāmakaokapāoʻo may symbolically represent the **ulua**, the fish traditionally sacrificed in place of a human on temple altars during 'Ai Kapu ceremonies, as noted in earlier examples (Pukui & Elbert 1986:369).  
– However, here the equation is **inverted**: it is **human flesh** (symbolically) being used in **place of sacred food**, and the act is one of **violence**, not ritual reverence. It suggests a breakdown of sacred practice or the old order, and foreshadows conflict.  
• The name **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo** means “The Eyes of the Pāoʻo fish.” Since **pāoʻo** also can be connected to **poʻo** (head) through sound (a common practice in Hawaiian poetics), the passage creates a clever double entendre — the child's name becomes part of the threat. Eating “the eyes” of the pāoʻo is effectively eating “the eyes of Nāmakaokapāoʻo,” further suggesting ritual cannibalism or symbolic consumption of spiritual vision.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children saw him coming and ran quickly, fleeing to a distance out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey! Here is the knife in my hand—it is for cutting off your head today, sever your head and roast it with sweet potatoes so that I may eat before, and then you will be done for.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not respond to Puali‘i’s words. Then Puali‘i spoke a second time. Puali‘i prepared his knife to cut off Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head. At that moment, Nāmakaokapāo‘o began to chant his death chant for Puali‘i. He sang thus:

**Paragraph 7:**  
• This passage is pivotal in the narrative for depicting a dramatic confrontation between two central figures—Puali‘i, the stepfather, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, the semi-divine child of a chief and a goddess/demigoddess. Notably, it juxtaposes a violent, human-driven act with a ritualistic, poetic response that is emblematic of Hawaiian oral traditions: a *pule make*, or death chant. The passage also illustrates the broader cosmological tension between the old order (and its violent dictates) and the divine child who represents transformation and new authority.

**Characters and Cultural Contexts:**  
• *Puali‘i* (perhaps “child of the chief”)—here depicted as a man of decisive, ferocious momentum and intent. His grabbing of a knife (ko‘ilipi < *ko‘i*, knife, and possibly *‘līpī*, a variant of *‘ilipi*, French for “razor”) suggests he is under intense emotional influence. His actions signal a regression into older rituals of violence and perhaps blood sacrifice, in contrast to the rising power of the demigod Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  
– The mention that all the other children flee out of fear (*maka‘u*) indicates that Puali‘i is not simply a local man, but a figure of social authority, perhaps even a *kāula* or priest-like figure capable of wielding divine wrath as a weapon. In cultural context, this echoes the *āio* tradition—unpredictable figures in Hawaiian mythology who could be either mentors or threats depending on their *mana* and mood.  

• *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (The Eyes of the pāo‘o fish) is of deep spiritual lineage and cosmic identity. His act of roasting the *‘au ‘uala* (sweet potato vines) is symbolic and ritualistic. It suggests a rejection of the normative hierarchy of food consumption, particularly in the *'Ai Kapu* era where root foods such as *'uala* were allowed for men and women to eat together only at certain times.  
– To roast the vine instead of the tuber (the part usually food) is potentially subversive—it may reflect an inversion of traditional practices and possibly a foreshadowing that the *'Ai Kapu* era is nearing its end, catalyzed by beings such as him who combine both divine and royal status. His four sweet potatoes thus might hold ritual number significance.

• The chant itself is of immense mythological, linguistic, and ritualistic importance. It is a *pule make*—a poetic incantation spoken at the time of death or impending doom. The lines are replete with symbolic metaphors and allude to Hawaiian cosmology, including relationships among deities and ancestral forces. Below is a line-by-line analysis:

– **“Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o”**:  
This begins with a paradox: even as someone is trying to kill him, the speaker offers *aloha*, love or farewell—it could mean both. The *maka*, or eyes, of *wahi pāo‘o* (my pāo‘o fish) signal the identity of the speaker (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o), whose vision or spiritual sight already sees the reversal of roles—for though he may appear as an innocent child being threatened, his chant forecasts the death of the attacker. This line could be read as an oracle invoking the *mana* of the fish *pāo‘o*, known in Hawaiian mythology as a keen-eyed creature tied with deep seeing and spiritual navigation underwater. This connects with the lineage of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, possibly (and literally) being a child with oceanic and seer-like divine ancestry.

– **“E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei”**:  
This line suggests a cosmic convulsion or spiritual earthquake—the rising of divine wrath. The *hapupu‘u* is a rising in tumult. *Hāpāpa‘a*, perhaps related to *pāpa‘a*, solid or firm, could imply that the divine force is now being unleashed with full force against the mortal attacker. These are not words of fear, but rather of an invocation of divine counteraction.

– **“E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha / E waiho paha Nākukui‘aimakaokalani”**:  
These lines may reference the *kukui* torch or the concept of illumination. *Nākukui*‘aimakaokalani possibly refers to eyes that see in the dark, or a diadem of light that looks upon the attacker. The use of *waiho* (to leave behind, abandon, dedicate) implies ritual sacrifice—not of himself, but of the aggressor, Puali‘i.

– **“‘O Kukui‘aimakaokalani kēlā, / ‘O ku‘u wahi aikāne kēia”**:   
Kukui‘aimakaokalani could refer to a divine ancestral figure. The term *aikāne* is a deep and ambiguous term in Hawaiian; most scholars concur that it can indicate a very close male companion, whether emotional, spiritual, or even intimate. The line suggests that Nāmakaokapāo‘o is invoking a divine beloved or spirit guard in the plural, possibly Kanaloa or other ocean guardians linked to Namaka’s lineage.  

– **“‘O Nāmakaokai‘a ke ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i”**:  
This is a clear claim of royalty. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o identifies himself as a great chief of Hawai‘i (Nāmakaokai‘a = perhaps “The Sea-Eyed One”). This establishes his ultimate authority and divine claim to power. The change from *Nāmakaokapāo‘o (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish)* in the line before to *Nāmakaokai‘a (the eyes of the ocean)* now is deeply symbolic—it indicates that he has shifted identity from a local fish spirit to a broader, cosmic oceanic deity, aligning with the major deity Namaka (Nā-maka-o-kāne), the sister of Pele, who rose from Molokini Crater.  

– **“E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale, / ‘O kānaka nō me ka ihe, / ‘O ka ihe nō me ka pahu, / Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”**  
In this section, the chant closes with dramatic imagery of battle inversion and reversal of fate.  
– *He‘e*—to slide, to escape, to flee—echoes here. The repetition “e he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē” suggests an accelerating motion of retreat—for Puali‘i, not the child.  
– The last couplet speaks of reversal (*kanaka me ka ihe, ihe me ka pahu*—the man vs. the spear, the spear vs. the drum) which is poetic code for the interchange of the mortal and the divine in a cosmic confrontation. The drum (*pahu*) is a sacred instrument in Hawaiian belief, often used to attract divine attention (used at *heiau*, in hula, in war ceremonies). Here, the spear becomes powerless in the face of divine rhythm and song.  
– The final line *Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o* is not a final plea for death but a ritual sealing of fate — in the mouth of the child, this line becomes a prophecy. It’s as though he has announced that *kāu make* (your death) is happening now, not mine.

**Cultural Symbolism and Allegory:**
• Puali‘i represents the last vestiges or echoes of *'Ai Kapu* law, the violent dominion of men, the use of weapons and sacrifice to retain masculine authority. He wants to consume the child along with the ‘uala and ‘au ‘uala, echoing the old custom of ritual sacrifice using vegetable and animal (or human) substitutes. The inclusion of head and eyes in the execution motif reflects the act of *'ai kapu*, or consuming the essence of another for spiritual power.
• Nāmakaokapāo‘o, however, is the child of both a *kanaka ali‘i* (royal man) Kauluakaha‘i, and a woman/spirit/woman with divinity (possibly an *ʻaumākua*) in Pōka‘ī. The name *Pō-ka-ʻi* could mean “Night Falls Upon the Chief” or “Night Embellished One”—suggestive of nobility, mystery, perhaps even connection to the feminine lunar god Hanaila in some interpretations.  
– Given this parentage, and his own oceanic name (*pāo‘o* linked to seerlike fish and the ocean), Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a liminal figure akin to Namaka in Hawaiian cosmology, representing a coming age—one that transcends *'Ai Kapu*, shifts cultural norms, and calls forth the collective strength of divine ancestors (through the *pule make*).

**Conclusion:**
This passage is a turning point in the story—not only for its depiction of violence and inevitability of death, but for its literary and cosmological depth. The *pule make* signifies more than a child’s lament or shielded defiance—it is an invocation of ancestral powers and a ritual death chant that, in the act of seeming humiliation or execution, enacts the metaphysical reversal of power. The child Nāmakaokapāo‘o, even in mortal danger, takes control by calling upon the *na‘ao* (intuitive knowledge), the oceanic ancestry, and the sacred poetic form to transcend the violence of the age. This scene functions as both a mythic initiation and a prophecy—heralding the emergence of a new cosmological and cultural phase.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Now we speak briefly of those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokaiʻa, who were great chiefs of Hawaiʻi. Nāmakaokalani was the father, and Nāmakaokaiʻa was the child, but they had already entered into the prayers of Nāmakaokapāoʻo.","**Paragraph 8 (Commentary):**  
• The passage introduces two new characters, both bearing closely related names, which is a stylistic indicator in Hawaiian literature that these figures may have thematic or mythological parallels to the main protagonist, Nāmakaokapāoʻo.  
– Their similarity in naming suggests a spiritual or generational connection and perhaps serves to mirror or contrast aspects of Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s character, role, or destiny.  

• **Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (The eyes of the sky/heaven)**  
– This name reflects divine or heavenly origins. The prefix *Nā-maka-o* (""the eyes of"") is recurring in this narrative cycle and has strong mythological connotations, echoing the oceanic divinity Namaka (Hawaiian sea goddess and sister of Pele).  
– The suffix *-o-ka-lani* (""of the heavens"") indicates a celestial being or someone with authority sanctioned by the gods. The name may also imply that this figure is a divine watcher or guardian in the cultural cosmology.  
– As a *makua kāne* (father), he is established as a chief of great stature (aliʻi nui) from Hawai‘i, and therefore likely a ruler of political and religious importance.  
– This may place him in the lineage of kapu (sacred) chiefs, potentially marking him as a descendant of the gods or as a keeper of sacred traditions rooted in the old order.  

• **Nā-maka-o-ka-iʻa (The eyes of the fish)**  
– This name is more literal and may evoke imagery of marine-based divinity or ritual. *Iʻa* can refer specifically to fish, which in the 'Ai Kapu era, were gendered—often reserved for men or higher-ranking individuals during times of strict kapu observance.  
– As the *keiki* (child) of Nāmakaokalani, this character is shown as part of a sacred bloodline or priestly line that links back to the heavens and/or divine rulers.  
– However, the narrative adds a layered twist by stating that both of these figures—despite their rank and power—“had already entered into the prayers of Nāmakaokapāoʻo.”  
– This phrase suggests that Nāmakaokapāoʻo had either summoned or eclipsed these two aliʻi in the ritual or mythological space, possibly through invocation, contest, or symbolic victory over them.  

• **Cultural Implication – The Power of the Praying Voice**  
– In traditional Hawaiian cosmology, the act of *pule* (prayer, incantation, spell) could be a powerful means of asserting mana (spiritual power) over other beings—gods, chiefs, or even landscapes.  
– The phrase “ua komo i loko o ka pule” (“had entered into the prayer”) does not mean they were simply mentioned in prayer, but that they were *enclosed within the power* of Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s utterance, perhaps thereby subdued, included, or symbolically defeated in ritual space.  
– Nāmakaokapāoʻo, an outsider or child of mixed divinity and humanity (hemō), is here asserting a power that rivals or overrides the divine lineage of ancient aliʻi. This may symbolically represent a break from traditional lineage-based religious authority, and the rise of individualized mana and spiritual challenge.  

• **Allegorical Reading – Myth as Time Shift**  
– The two aliʻi could represent the old kapu system, with their names rooted in celestial and oceanic divinities that mirror those of traditional Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., Namaka, Kane, Lani).  
– Nāmakaokapāoʻo, in contrast, operates outside the bounds of rigid lineage and kapu. He is presented as a transformative figure, one whose prayers can enclose, interact with, or replace figures of the prior era.  
– The sentence can be interpreted as an allegory of cultural and religious transformation—a mythic narrative that charts the transition from the divine right of chiefs rooted in heavenly genealogy to a new mode of spiritual efficacy based on individual charisma and pule power.  

• **Thematic Continuity – The Rising Tide of the Protagonist**  
– The movement of this narrative shows the emergence of Nāmakaokapāoʻo not only as a figure of physical strength but also of spiritual might.  
– By subsuming the names and authority of the ""great chiefs of Hawaiʻi"" into his own pule, he becomes the center of mythological discourse. This subtly reorients the cosmological axis of the story away from lineage and kings to the individual power of spirit and voice.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Nāmakaokapāo‘o then picked up the head of Puali‘i and cast it into the waters of Waipouli, a cave on the seashore of Honouliuli, five miles distant.","**Paragraph 9:**

• This section constitutes a dramatic climactic moment in the narrative of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, marked by a supernatural transformation and deeply rooted cultural symbolism. The depiction of post-mortem speech from the head of the decapitated Pua-li‘i introduces an esoteric and possibly shamanic element, consistent with motifs found in many ancient Hawaiian chants (*mele*) and origin stories, particularly those associated with demigods, healers, or Kahiko-era traditions;  

• The sequence begins with: *A pau ka pule āna ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (“When Nāmakaokapāo‘o finished his prayer”) – indicating that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was engaged in a sacred activity—perhaps invoking protection, divine guidance, or spiritual fortitude prior to the confrontation. The prayer (*pule*) in Hawaiian tradition often served to align oneself with the ancestral and divine forces before undertaking any significant act, physical or metaphysical;  

• *I ia wā i ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o Nāmakaokapāo‘o* – “At that moment, Puali‘i struck him with a chisel on the top of the head” – The *ko‘ilipi* (chisel) used by Puali‘i suggests a stone or bone tool of symbolic significance—possibly a *pōhaku ki‘i* (carving stone or adze) or a bone implement used in ritualistic contexts, such as in *pīnī‘au* (bone-setting) or *anāna / lāʻau lapaʻau* (traditional healing). That such an instrument was used in this act underscores the ritual-like nature of the incident, perhaps resembling a spiritual balancing (*pono*) or *kānāwai* (justice/retaliation) governed by the old laws and divine mandates;  

• *E ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē* – “…so that the brains spattered upon Puali‘i, and the head spoke from that place” – The severing and scattering of intellect (*loi*) symbolizes more than just violence—it marks a disruption in mana (*supernatural power*) and the release of spirit (*uhane*) into the metaphysical realm. The fact that the decapitated head *still speaks* is a powerful narrative device suggesting the persistence of spirit in the Hawaiian cosmology; that consciousness continues beyond the physical body is a belief upheld in various accounts involving *‘unihipili* (spirit bodies) and *aumākua* (ancestral deities). The head (*po‘o*) is considered a sacred part of the human being, sometimes kept as a *ho‘ohāloa pūhana* (spirit guardian) or used in *hānau ho‘okani* (rebirth rituals for others);  

– **Etymology Analysis**: The name *Pua-li‘i* is significant. *Pua* is a root suggesting origin, beginning, or ancestry (as in *puāwai*—source of water or blood). *Li‘i* means small or noble, suggesting lineage in royal or *ali‘i* bloodline standing. The name may imply a noble origin descended from a source or ancestral wellspring; however, Pua-li‘i in this story represents regression to old, violent practices rather than moral refinement—possibly alluding to the regression seen in the tensions of the post-'Ai Kapu era, when figures of former power sought to restore old traditions at the expense of new moral frameworks;  

• *Pane mai ke po‘o o Puali‘i iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”* – “The head of Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, saying: ‘Farewell, O Nāmakaokapāo‘o.’” – The farewell (*aloha ‘oe*) at death is a formal recognition of passage, transformation, or transcendence. Here, the *po‘o* itself serves as a literal and metaphorical mouthpiece conveying ancestral wisdom or judgment from the other side. The spiritual hierarchy of head over body is reversed momentarily, with the head attaining power in death that it lacked in life;

– Some interpretations draw from the broader motif of *ka po‘o ‘ōlelo aku nei* (“speaking head”) in Polynesian mythology, where the separation of the head from the body emphasizes *kanaka waiho*—man abandoned—while the head becomes a vessel for lingering knowledge or truth;

• *Lālau akula ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ke po‘o o Puali‘i a kiola akula i kai o Waipouli, he ana ma kahakai o Honouliuli, ‘o kona loa, ‘elima mile ka loa.* – “…Nāmakaokapāo‘o then picked up the head of Puali‘i and cast it into the waters of Waipouli, a cave on the seashore of Honouliuli, five miles distant.” – The casting of the head into the water is a symbolic conclusion to the life of Pua-li‘i. Water (*wai*) and especially caves (*ana*) are ritual spaces of transformation and kūpuna veneration in Hawaiian cosmology. *Waipouli* (“dark water” or “deep water”) located on the seacoast of *Hono-uliuli* (“dark bay”), further locates this moment in sacred, shadowed space — often a zone associated with spirits and liminality in ancestral traditions;

– **Symbolism of Distance**: The distance—five miles (*elima mile*)—may carry numerological or symbolic weight. The number five (*elimā*) frequently appears in Hawaiian tradition, associated with the cycle of the moon (five *āina kai* phases), the body (*po‘o, lima ‘elima*), and ritualized offerings. This may signify a metaphysical separation, that Pua-li‘i's *uhane* is guided across not only physical terrain but across cosmic thresholds;  

• Allegorical Interpretation: Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s journey continues, now carrying with it the *po‘o* of Pua-liʻi, echoing the mythic structures in the *mo‘olelo papahele* (legendary tales) of heroic children with divine links (e.g., Kai-hi*-ka*-moku, Pele, Māui) who overcome obstacles, often with symbolic deaths leading to new kinds of spiritual power or social truths. The head of Pua-li‘i is discarded at Honouliuli, near the site of earlier tension—the cooked ulua and sweet potato misguidedly served as substitution for proper *'ai kapu* practice—the act of throwing the head into a cave by the sea may symbolize a final rejection of the past practices. Water becomes both purifier and agent of finality; it accepts spiritual remains while preventing their lingering over the land and its people.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",

The man said: “O chief! A very small but extremely strong child exists whose father has died, and his father's head was carried a very long distance into the sea—five miles long. If ‘Ama‘u hears this, he will desire to fight the child and he will kill the child, but I will not kill the child—there is no one like him in strength."" While the man was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words spoken of him.","**Paragraph 10 Commentary**:

• This paragraph begins as a transition point, marking the death of Puali‘i, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s stepfather, and the boy’s return to live exclusively with his mother, Pō-ka-'ī. It marks the first time it is specifically stated that Nāmakaokapāo‘o does not eat food—likely pointing to his supernatural nature, and perhaps alluding to his part-god origins (“he 'ao'ao akua” from earlier passages).

– The lack of need for sustenance is a common trait of kāula (prophets), akua (gods), and 'aumākua (ancestral spirits), and may indicate that Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a supernatural figure or represents a mythic archetype whose strength is derived from divine or ancestral powers.

• The narrative shifts focus to the island of O‘ahu where 'Ama'u, a high chief (ali‘i), is living in Waikīkī. A messenger travels a long distance from Honouliuli ('Ewa, O‘ahu) to Waikīkī specifically to report news of Nāmakaokapāo‘o's strength to the ali‘i.
– Travel in ancient Hawai‘i was done entirely on foot or by canoe. A journey from Honouliuli to Waikīkī would likely take several hours to a full day, suggesting the importance of the message and the urgency or intrigue surrounding Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s strength.

• The messenger describes Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o as “he keiki 'u'uku ikaika loa”—“a very small but extremely strong child”— reinforcing the paradox central to this character: small in physique (like a demigod or god) yet immensely powerful. The theme of paradox and spiritual power hidden within a small frame continues.

– This motif is echoed in the legendary figure of Kāneapua, another demigod or shape-shifter known for immense strength yet childlike appearance, and often associated with Pele and water (Pukui: Mary Kawena Pukui, ""The Polynesian Family System in Ka'ū, Hawai‘i"").

• The mention that “ua make kona makua kāne a ua kiola ‘ia kona po'o i kai loa, he wahi lō‘ihi loa, ‘elima mile ka lō‘ihi” (“his father has died and his father's head was carried a very long distance into the sea—five miles long”) serves as a flashback but is likely symbolic rather than literal.

– The “father’s head being carried five miles into the sea” may symbolize either the death of a major chief or priest whose spiritual power was still present, and which now resides in the son, Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Alternatively, it alludes to the burial customs of the 'Ai Kapu era, where the bones of high chiefs were often taken to sacred sea burials to preserve their mana.

– The five-mile sea journey may be symbolic of the spiritual distance between the world of the living and the realm of ancestors or gods. It is far enough to indicate a complete passage into the sacred space, yet consistent with tales of mariners who could travel such distances off O‘ahu’s southern shores.

• The messenger further states that “if ‘Ama‘u hears this, he will desire to fight the child and he will kill the child, but I will not kill the child—for there is no one like him in strength.” This creates anticipation and stakes in the plot, and also demonstrates cultural attitudes toward strength, warfare, and mana.

– In traditional Hawaiian thought, mana (spiritual power) often resided in ali‘i by birth right and could be challenged by those with greater strength or divine favor. If Nāmakaokapāo‘o had the strength to challenge or defeat a high chief like ‘Ama‘u, it would imply that he either possessed greater mana or was being used as a kāula or 'aumākua to enact divine justice or retribution.

• The closing clause confirms that Nāmakaokapāo‘o himself overheard the message spoken of him in Waikīkī, suggesting his supernatural reach or presence extended beyond his physical space. It also foreshadows the boy’s impending confrontation with the ruling chief of O‘ahu.

– The act of overhearing an insult, challenge, or call to action is a frequent narrative device in traditional mo‘olelo, where the hero responds to a challenge even if not personally delivered.

– This moment marks the beginning of the larger narrative arc in which Nāmakaokapāo‘o must confront not just Puali‘i, but a true ali‘i—raising the stakes and situating this particular mo‘olelo within a genre of hero narratives that pit young demi-gods against established chiefs, often with revolutionary or symbolic implications.","When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.","**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.","Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there.

They arrived at the plains of Keahumoa, entered the house, but found no one there. They prepared to return when Nāmakaokapāo'o shouted from the rooftop. They heard the voice but could not see the body, so they asked, ""Who are you that speaks?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o answered, “It is I who is here above.” Then eight of the men climbed up—one group of four on the back of the house, the other four on the front—and found Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, “What is your purpose coming here today?” They replied, “We have come to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o, said to be a little child like you, yet strong and brave, who struck down his stepfather, Puali'i.”","**Paragraph 12:**
• This paragraph marks the arrival of an external challenge to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s domain at Keahumoa. It introduces warfare as a central motif, showing that word of Nāmakaokapāo'o's deeds has already reached Waikīkī, a historically prominent region on O'ahu associated with powerful ali‘i (chiefs) and significant cultural practices.  
• 'Ama'u: **ʻA-maʻu** (the silent or the hidden one / the tranquil), possibly referring to a certain mysteriousness or stealthiness in demeanor befitting a chief. The name may also suggest the fern *mau* (dry land fern), used metaphorically for someone who stands firm and unyielding. 'Ama'u is from Waikīkī (Wai-kī-kī: ""spilling waters,"" referring to the abundant springs and waterways of this area). His role as a chief delegating warriors suggests a hierarchical military structure typical of pre-‘Ai Kapu Hawaiian warfare.  
• The composition of the warriors—""**ehā po'e kaua, aia ma ka po’e ho’okahi he kanahā kumamāwalu kānaka ka nui**""—introduces yet another numeric riddle: the group of four includes one particularly large warrior (""eight feet tall""), suggesting that the numerical references in this story are not literal, but symbolic. This use of numbers may function as a kaona (""hidden meaning"") tied to mana (spiritual power) and transformation, possibly aligning with kapu-breaking or deification themes common in moʻolelo Hawaiʻi.  
• The warriors travel to **Ke-a-hu-moa** (the moa heap, or chicken heap, depending on source) and enter the house expecting to find Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. This environment establishes a setting where domestic space is implicated in martial conflict, which aligns with practices from the **pre-ʻAi Kapu era**, where familial and political tensions often culminated in confrontations—even within the home. The lack of a visible inhabitant in the house is a deliberate dramatic device, emphasizing Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s command of space and perception—symbolically positioning him above others even before the confrontation begins.
– The phrase **""komolīna hoi aku la ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o i luna o kaʻupokū""** invites spatial and metaphoric analysis. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o speaks from ""the roof"" (*kaʻupoku*), placing him in a superior spiritual and physical position both literally and symbolically. In traditional Hawaiian architecture, the house (hale) represents the body, and the roof or ridgepole (ʻiʻoko) is representative of ancestral lineage and spiritual consciousness (HIN, Traditional Hale Studies). This placement suggests that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o commands ancestral power and spiritual insight, contrasting the worldly strength of the Waikīkī warriors.
• The warriors are confused by the voice but not the sight—hearing but not seeing the body. This echoes older mythological themes where the true hero or akua (god/s) reveals themselves only visually after establishing dominance verbally. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s use of voice before being seen suggests divine or semi-divine status. Similar to how Kāne or Lono might announce their presence before manifesting, the verbal assertion of identity (""Eia nō wau i luna nei"") resonates with chants used in traditional Hawaiian rituals—especially those performed on heiau (temples).  
• The warriors then climb to confront him, dividing evenly (four behind the house, four at the front), indicating a belief in the necessity of surrounding and controlling all exits—perhaps an old **ʻōʻō kaua** (war tactics) method of the time, common before muskets and modern weaponry. The number 8 recurs in this confrontation (eight men climbing)—suggesting a symbolic threshold or rite of passage, perhaps echoing the kāhiko (ancient), pre-missionary worldview which favored specific numerological patterns for ritual resonance.  
• The warriors reveal they were not simply hunting Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o for glory, but because he had already committed the ultimate symbolic act by **killing his stepfather**. This alludes to a break with ancestral protocols: in traditional Hawaiian society, a stepfather occupies a position of authority, and his death by a child's hand marks a profound disruption in the **kuleana** (duties, responsibilities) and **kapu** (sacred laws), especially those under the **ʻAi Kapu** system concerning familial respect and hierarchy.
– The warriors, sent by a Waikīkī ruler, may be attempting to enact **hūnāwali** (punishment or vendetta), a practice in pre-unified Hawaiʻi where chiefs acted as arbiters of justice and often dispatched warriors to eliminate threats or enforce retribution for disruptive acts. However, the narrative frames them as ignorant outsiders underestimating the symbolic import of the boy—they call him “a child like you,” believing Nāmakaokapāo'o to be a juvenile delinquent, rather than the divine agent he represents.  
• From a mythopoetic perspective, the warriors from Waikīkī may embody the remnants of the old **ʻAi Kapu order**, while Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, still living in the Keahumoa plains, reflects a new era marked by defiance of traditional limits, particularly those associated with divine punishment and retribution. This portion sets the stage for an eschatological confrontation between old ritual norms and a rising paradigm of personal agency and transformation.","Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, ""Where is that voice coming from?"" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I'm up here."" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""What in the world are you all doing here?"" They said, ""We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.""","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

He told 'Ama'u of their complete deaths, and he was the one who went to inform 'Ama'u.","**Paragraph 13 – Commentary:**

• This passage continues the narrative surrounding Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s extraordinary strength and bold defiance against those who doubt or challenge his abilities. His self-identification as ʻkanaka nui nōʻ suggests not only his confidence but also a declaration of mana (spiritual power and status) that aligns with traditional Hawaiian expressions of identity tied closely to name, lineage, and deeds. The phrase ""he kanaka nui nō 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o"" serves to affirm his socio-political standing as a powerful figure.  
• The confrontation demonstrates the traditional Hawaiian practice of hakakā (to wrestle), a valued skill often showcased by young warriors or aliʻi in proving their strength and training. The invitation by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o to return ""i lalo e hakakā ai"" (down below to wrestle) is significant—it may suggest ritualistic engagement in combat or mimicry of formal challenge practices where physical contests were used to resolve disputes. 
• The opponents' reply is hostile and fatalistic: they declare that death awaits him ""no laila, e make ana 'oe iā mākou, 'a'ole 'oe e ola."" This implies they may believe he is a false claimant or a threat to their lineage or standing. The language used here is evocative of the tensions in aliʻi society, where name ownership and genealogical legitimacy could result in conflict or even death.  
• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s triumph over his attackers—with only one escaping—emphasizes his superior strength and reinforces the earlier motif in the text of Nāmakaokapāo'o as a demi-god-like figure who overcomes human and supernatural adversaries alike.  
• The fleeing survivor's journey to find 'Amaʻu in Waikīkī suggests that the narrative is connected to or has implications for the high chiefly circles of Oʻahu. Waikīkī was a prominent seat of aliʻi including Kalaniʻōpuʻu and others, and perhaps 'Amaʻu was a significant chief connected to this lineage or political power structure. The use of Waikīkī as a location where the news of this battle arrives highlights the geographical and political importance of Oʻahu in ancestral Hawaiian narratives.  
• 'Amaʻu’s name may also carry connotative meaning—'A-ma'u (the one who ascends at night)—possibly symbolizing someone who operates in secrecy or shadows, rising at odd times, perhaps a sorcerer, guardian, or political agent.  
• The narrative structure here is typical of heroic myths: a claim of identity or right is made, met with opposition and danger; victory is achieved through strength or divine favor; a survivor spreads news of the outcome, setting up future events or broader implications for the hero.  
– This passage embodies cultural values around contest, honor, and lineage recognition in pre-contact Hawaiian society, where name and mana were deeply interwoven and often challenged. Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions, though violent, align with the narrative tropes of indigenous heroism where physical prowess, spiritual status, and genealogical boasting are key elements.","Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him."" The soldiers said, ""No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive."" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ""Well, let's go down and fight."" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",

When 'Ama'u and his people arrived in 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o had already destroyed everyone utterly; none remained, and so 'Ama'u was slain. Thus the whole of O'ahu came under the power of Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then he took his mother and placed her to dwell upon the land of O'ahu.","**Paragraph 14:**  
• This passage concludes the military campaign of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāoʻo fish) against the invading forces of ʻA-maʻu (the “twisted” or “curled” one, perhaps alluding to cunning, coiled intentions, or deceptive maneuvers in warfare), and marks the full consolidation of Nāmakaokapāo'o's dominion over the island of O'ahu.  
– The use of the term *hoʻomākaukau* (to prepare, make ready) implies a ritual and strategic preparation for war, which in the pre-contact Hawaiian context would have included consultation with *kāula* (prophets), offerings at *heiau*, and the recitation of *oli noʻeau* (expert ceremonial chants) to secure divine favor and battle-readiness (*hoʻomanawa*).  
• The mention of *kumamāwalu* (eighteen) war canoes is significant. The number eighteen does not appear to be symbolic in the same way as other numbers in Hawaiian tradition (e.g., 4, 7, 8, 13), but its precise use here likely reflects a cultural record of the tangible military strength of 'Ama'u's forces, perhaps denoting a substantial and well-coordinated invasion force.  
– Eighteen war canoes would have carried a significant number of warriors, at least a dozen or more per canoe if tradition holds, and would indicate an organized campaign rather than a mere skirmish.  
• The battle occurs in *ʻEwa*, a traditional district known for its strategic position on the southern part of Oʻahu. 'Ewa was historically associated with warfare and battle-readiness, being the site of many significant encounters and home to the famed *heiau* of Kaʻena and Manoa, both centers of spiritual and military power.  
– The name ʻEwa itself is said to derive from the story of Pele’s sister, Hiʻiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele, who traveled from the windward side of the island to the leeward side and found it less fertile, thus calling it *ʻEwa* – “crooked” or “uneven.” This fits the theme of tension between opposing forces in this narrative.  
• That Nāmakaokapāo'o had already *luku ā pau loa*—completely destroyed—his enemies implies not only military supremacy but also a thematic trope found in moʻolelo Hawaiʻi: the *unihipili kānā* (avenger) motif, where the protagonist exacts justice or dominance over a region.  
– This destruction is complete and final: *ʻaʻole kanaka koe*, meaning none were spared. This could signal not just military victory, but a symbolic cleansing or resetting of power dynamics on the island.  
• ʻAmaʻu’s death serves as a climactic turning point: he is killed upon arrival, illustrating the overwhelming nature of Nāmakaokapāoʻo's power, and emphasizing that no opposition could survive despite preparation.  
• The phrase *puni aʻela o Oʻahu nei iā Nāmakaokapāoʻo* signifies total conquest and rule over the island. This is a *hōʻāinakō* (unification under one rule), often seen in the rise of ruling chiefs like ʻUmi-a-Līloa or even later historical figures such as Kamehameha I.  
– It should be noted that control of Oʻahu by a single chief is a rare motif in this early period, implying a pre-unification of the island under Nāmakaokapāoʻo, a character often associated with *nānā pākī* (watchful eyes) and kānā (vindictiveness or just avengement), alluding to protective yet aggressive rulership.  
• The final act of taking his mother and placing her *i luna o ka ʻāina Oʻahu* (atop the land of Oʻahu) is both a literal and symbolic act:  
– Literally, it places her in a position of honor and safety, possibly on one of the highlands of Oʻahu like Lāʻie or Kāneʻohe, where royal families often resided for spiritual, health, and defensive reasons.  
– Symbolically, this is a *puʻuhonua* gesture—establishing a peace through strength and reaffirming the matrilineal reverence central to Hawaiian leadership. The mother is elevated through the son’s accomplishments, and the land is sanctified under the presence of a *wahine aliʻi* (chiefly woman), reinforcing *mana wahine* (female sacred power).  
• Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions reflect an earlier Hawaiian heroic ideal: strong, impulsive, and deeply familial. While later unifiers like Kamehameha governed with a more centralized and diplomatic model, Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s rule is one of battlefield dominance followed by symbolic elevation of bloodline legitimacy.","When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.","**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture.",
