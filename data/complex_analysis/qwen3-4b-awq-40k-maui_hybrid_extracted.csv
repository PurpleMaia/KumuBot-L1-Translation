### **5. Conclusion**  
This passage is a genealogical or historical record from 19th-century Hawaii, highlighting the social hierarchy, titles, and familial relationships. It reflects the cultural emphasis on lineage, authority, and the formal language used to describe status in Hawaiian society. The text serves as a window into the structured, hierarchical nature of Hawaiian social and political life.","Legend of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  CHAPTER 1  NĀMAKAOKAPĀO‘O PULLS OUT PUALI‘I'S SWEET  POTATO FIELD—HE THREATENS TO BEHEAD THE  BOY, BUT IS KILLED—‘AMA‘U, THE KING, SENDS   SOLDIERS TO KILL HIM—HE SLAYS THEM AND THE  KING.","• Typically, 19th-century Hawaiian literary conventions  include using a) Roman numerals for chapter  numbers and b) a chapter summary up front. Both of  these conventions follow those used in English and  Hawaiian versions of the *Holy Bible* (*Baibala  Hemolele*).  **Paragraph 1:**  • It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;  **Paragraph 2:**  • Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  **Paragraph 3:**  • A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;  **Paragraph 4:**  • Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’; **Paragraph 5:**  • While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Here’s a breakdown of its cultural, historical, and linguistic significance:  

### **Cultural Context**  
1. **Land as Central to Identity**:  
   The phrase *“ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina”* (in the land of Ewa) underscores the deep connection between Hawaiian identity and the land. Ewa is a historical and cultural region in Hawaii, known for its significance in Hawaiian history and the presence of the Kona district. The mention of *“launa kino ai”* (the land is in good condition) reflects the Hawaiian worldview where the health of the land is tied to the well-being of the people.  

2. **Family and Lineage**:  
   The text introduces two individuals: *Pōka‘ī* and *Kauluakaha‘i*. These names are likely place names or ancestral figures, as Hawaiian genealogies often reference specific individuals or locations. The phrase *“hāpai ‘o Pōka‘ī”* (Pōka‘ī is a child) and *“ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i”* (Kauluakaha‘i is a child) emphasizes the continuity of lineage and the role of children in perpetuating family and community ties.  

3. **Community and Growth**:  
   The final phrase *“hānau”* (to grow) is a key term in Hawaiian culture, symbolizing both physical growth (of crops, land) and the expansion of family or community. The text suggests that the presence of children (Pōka‘ī and Kauluakaha‘i) is a sign of vitality and the future of the community.  

### **Historical Significance**  
1. **Genealogical Record**:  
   The passage likely originates from a genealogical or historical text, such as a *mākāhia* (genealogy) or a *pūʻuhonua* (historical account). These texts were crucial in Hawaiian society for documenting lineage, land ownership, and social relationships. The mention of *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (a place name) and the land of Ewa suggests a specific historical or geographic context.  

2. **Land and Ancestral Ties**:  
   The phrase *“ma laila lāua i launa kino ai”* (in the morning, the land is in good condition) reflects the Hawaiian concept of *kāne* (ancestral land) and the spiritual connection between people and the land. The text implies that the land’s health is a communal concern, tied to the well-being of the people who inhabit it.  

### **Linguistic Features**  
1. **Syntax and Structure**:  
   The passage uses a complex, poetic structure with multiple clauses, typical of Hawaiian genealogical texts. The repetition of *“kona”* (his/her) and *“me kona”* (with his/her) emphasizes the personal and relational aspects of the narrative. The use of *“ma”* (in) and *“iā”* (in) to indicate location (e.g., *“iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o”*) reflects the Hawaiian emphasis on place and identity.  

2. **Key Vocabulary**:  
   - **Hāpai**: Refers to a child or a descendant, often used in genealogical contexts.  
   - **Hānau**: A verb meaning ""to grow"" or ""to be born,"" with deep cultural significance in Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., the growth of the land, the birth of a child).  
   - **Moe ‘ana**: A verb meaning ""to move"" or ""to be in motion,"" which here likely refers to the dynamic relationship between the land and the people.  

3. **Cultural Metaphors**:  
   The phrase *“ma hope, hānau”* (and with that, they grow) uses *“hope”* (a term of hope or expectation) to link the presence of children to the future growth of the community. This reflects the Hawaiian belief in the cyclical nature of life and the importance of continuity.  

### **Conclusion**  
This passage encapsulates the Hawaiian values of land, family, and community, using precise linguistic and cultural terms to convey a historical narrative. It highlights the interdependence of people and land, the importance of lineage, and the spiritual and practical significance of growth in Hawaiian society. The text serves as a reminder of the enduring connection between Hawaiian identity and the natural world, a central theme in Hawaiian culture.","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",,

The son of Puali‘i is in Pōka‘ī, and he is making a meal for them, saying: ""I make a meal for you, my people."" Pōka‘ī says: ""How can you make a meal for us? You have been raised in the family of the child, and you are the one who is the kin."" Puali‘i says: ""It is not a matter of anything, you make a meal for you, let them go."" The son of Pōka‘ī. And the son of Pōka‘ī is with his son Puali‘i, at the school of Keahumoa, living.","This passage is a narrative excerpt from a traditional Hawaiian story, likely rooted in the oral traditions of the Hawaiian Islands. It reflects the cultural, linguistic, and social dynamics of Hawaiian society, emphasizing kinship, hospitality, and the role of family in community life. Below is a detailed analysis:  

### **Cultural Context**  
1. **Kinship and Family Structure**:  
   - The text repeatedly references familial relationships (e.g., *“akula ‘o Puali‘i”* = “the son of Puali‘i”), highlighting the central role of kinship in Hawaiian society. The term *“kanaka maika‘i”* (person of a family) underscores the importance of lineage and ancestry, which is a cornerstone of Hawaiian social identity.  
   - The phrase *“wahine na‘u”* (my people) reflects the communal, collective identity of a family or clan, emphasizing hospitality and interdependence.  

2. **Hospitality and Social Etiquette**:  
   - The dialogue between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i revolves around *makemake* (to make a meal), a verb tied to the Hawaiian concept of *malu* (hospitality). The exchange illustrates the social norms of offering food as a gesture of respect and care, a practice central to Hawaiian cultural values.  

3. **Historical Reference to Education**:  
   - The mention of *“ke kula o Keahumoa”* (the school of Keahumoa) references the establishment of schools in Hawaii during the 19th century. This reflects the tension between traditional Hawaiian values and the influence of Western education, a significant historical shift in Hawaiian society.  

### **Linguistic Features**  
1. **Syntax and Structure**:  
   - The passage uses a complex, layered syntax with embedded clauses (e.g., *“iho maila ‘o Puali‘i, he kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e”* = “the one who is the son of Puali‘i is a person of the family of Līhu‘e”). This structure mirrors the oral storytelling traditions of Hawaiian culture, where clarity and rhythm are prioritized over literal translation.  

2. **Kinship Terminology**:  
   - Terms like *“akula”* (son) and *“kāne”* (son) are used to emphasize familial relationships, a recurring theme in Hawaiian language and culture. The repetition of these terms reinforces the social hierarchy and the importance of lineage.  

3. **Dialectical and Regional Variations**:  
   - The use of *“kai”* (sea) and *“lawai‘a”* (waters) suggests a connection to the natural environment, a common theme in Hawaiian narratives. The term *“makemake”* (to make a meal) is a verb with specific cultural connotations, reflecting the role of food in Hawaiian social interactions.  

### **Historical Significance**  
1. **Colonial Influence and Cultural Adaptation**:  
   - The mention of *“ke kula o Keahumoa”* (the school of Keahumoa) alludes to the 19th-century establishment of Western-style schools in Hawaii, which disrupted traditional Hawaiian education. This reflects the broader historical context of cultural change and the tension between indigenous practices and colonial influence.  

2. **Preservation of Oral Tradition**:  
   - The story is likely a part of a larger oral tradition, passed down through generations. The use of specific names (Puali‘i, Pōka‘ī, Keahumoa) and locations (Honouliuli) suggests a connection to a specific community or lineage, emphasizing the role of oral history in preserving cultural identity.  

### **Conclusion**  
This passage encapsulates the values of kinship, hospitality, and community in Hawaiian culture. It reflects the interplay between traditional practices and historical changes, such as the introduction of Western education. The linguistic and cultural elements of the text provide insight into the social dynamics of Hawaiian society, where family, land, and community are deeply intertwined. The dialogue between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i serves as a microcosm of the broader cultural values of respect, humility, and collective responsibility.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",,

Then, the next day, Puali‘i went to Honouliuli to prepare food for the people.","This passage is a narrative excerpt from a Hawaiian text, likely from a historical or cultural record, describing a communal feast or gathering. Here’s a breakdown of its cultural, historical, and linguistic significance:  

### **Cultural Context**  
1. **Feast and Community (‘āina ‘ōla)**:  
   The text references a communal feast (‘āina ‘ōla), a central aspect of Hawaiian culture. The phrase *“mahī ‘ai”* (to work [to eat]) and the mention of food preparation (*“‘uala lō‘ihi e waiho nei”*) highlight the social and spiritual importance of feasting. Such events were not just about sustenance but also about reinforcing social bonds, honoring ancestors, and celebrating life cycles.  

2. **Names of Days (Māla)**:  
   The text names two days as *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*, a proper noun likely referring to a specific day or event. In Hawaiian culture, days are often named after deities, ancestors, or significant events. *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* may be a reference to a historical or mythological event, though its exact meaning requires further contextualization.  

3. **Gender Roles and Social Hierarchy**:  
   The mention of *“kāna wahine”* (the women) and *Pōka‘ī* (a proper noun, possibly a person or place) reflects the division of labor and social roles. Women were often central to food preparation and communal activities, while men might have been involved in gathering or resource management.  

4. **Historical Setting**:  
   The reference to *Honouliuli* (a place name) suggests the event took place in a specific location, possibly a village or sacred site. The act of *“kai”* (to go to) Honouliuli to prepare food implies a ritual or ceremonial gathering, which aligns with Hawaiian traditions of communal feasting.  

### **Linguistic Features**  
1. **Proper Nouns**:  
   - *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*: A named day or event, likely a historical reference.  
   - *Puali‘i*: A person or title, possibly a leader or elder.  
   - *Pōka‘ī*: A proper noun, possibly a person, place, or object.  
   - *Honouliuli*: A place name, possibly a village or sacred site.  

2. **Syntax and Structure**:  
   The text uses a narrative style with a clear sequence of events: preparation of food, naming of days, the speaker’s statement, and the action of going to a location. The use of *“a o‘o ka ‘uala”* (the food is prepared) and *“a laila, noa, ‘ai kāna wahine”* (the next day, the women eat) emphasizes the temporal and communal nature of the event.  

3. **Quotations and Dialogue**:  
   The quoted speech by Puali‘i (*“Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala”*) reflects the Hawaiian practice of using *“ōlelo”* (language) to convey cultural values. The phrase *“kālua ke po‘o”* (the food is ready) underscores the importance of food in Hawaiian culture, where meals are often tied to spiritual or communal significance.  

### **Historical Significance**  
This passage may reference a historical event or a mythological narrative. The mention of *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Honouliuli* suggests a specific time or place, possibly tied to a legendary or historical figure. The structure of the text aligns with Hawaiian oral traditions, where stories are passed down through generations, often involving feasts, ancestors, and natural elements.  

### **Conclusion**  
This passage encapsulates the cultural and social practices of Hawaiian society, emphasizing the role of food, communal gatherings, and the naming of days. It reflects the deep connection between daily life, spirituality, and the oral traditions that preserve Hawaiian identity. The use of proper nouns and the narrative structure highlight the importance of memory, history, and collective identity in Hawaiian culture.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",,

In that time, he is the one who is making a statement about the plant in the kapuahi, and the next day, he is the one who is making a statement about the plant. Pōka‘ī says: ""No."" Puali‘i says: ""Yes, it is the plant, and the things that are causing the plant to be affected are the things that are causing the plant to be affected in that day, and the next day, he is the one who is making a statement about the plant.""","This passage from Chapter 1, Paragraph 6 of a Hawaiian historical or cultural text provides a complex narrative involving plants, rituals, and dialogue. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its cultural, historical, and linguistic significance:  

### **Cultural Context**  
1. **Plant Symbolism and Rituals**:  
   The text references *huhuki* (a type of plant) and *kapuahi* (another plant), which are likely significant in Hawaiian traditional practices. Plants in Hawaiian culture often hold spiritual or medicinal value. The mention of *kapuahi* (possibly a sacred or ceremonial plant) suggests the text may relate to rituals, offerings, or the care of sacred flora. The dialogue between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i reflects a dispute or clarification about the plant’s condition, possibly tied to a ritual or healing context.  

2. **Community and Knowledge Sharing**:  
   The passage includes a dialogue where Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i (likely individuals with authority or expertise) debate the plant’s status. This mirrors traditional Hawaiian practices where elders or specialists (e.g., *mākāhaka* or *mākāhaka* specialists) resolve disputes or provide guidance. The phrase *“e ‘īna‘i ai ku‘u ‘uala”* (the plant is affected) implies a concern for the plant’s health, which could be tied to agricultural, medicinal, or ceremonial purposes.  

3. **Temporal and Spatial References**:  
   The use of *“laila”* (the next day) and *“kēia lā”* (that day) establishes a sequence of events, reflecting the Hawaiian emphasis on time and space in storytelling. This structure is common in oral traditions, where events are narrated in a linear, sequential manner to convey meaning.  

### **Historical Significance**  
1. **Traditional Knowledge Systems**:  
   The text likely reflects the *mākāhaka* (oral tradition) or *mākāhaka* (historical records) of Hawaiian culture, which preserved knowledge about plants, rituals, and social practices. The mention of *māla ‘elua* (three plants) and their classification as *“nui o nā māla ‘elua”* (the large ones) suggests a system of categorization, possibly tied to agricultural or medicinal knowledge.  

2. **Ceremonial or Healing Context**:  
   The dialogue between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i may relate to a ritual or healing scenario. The phrase *“e ‘īna‘i ai ku‘u ‘uala”* (the plant is affected) could indicate a spiritual or physical ailment, aligning with the historical practice of using plants in healing (e.g., *lāhui* or *kākau*).  

3. **Social Dynamics**:  
   The passage includes a dispute over the plant’s status, which may reflect the hierarchical or communal nature of Hawaiian society. The use of *“ho‘i a‘ela ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o”* (Nāmakaokapāo‘o is the one who is making a statement) suggests a role of authority or expertise, possibly a *mākāhaka* or *mākāhaka* figure.  

### **Linguistic Features**  
1. **Complex Sentence Structure**:  
   The passage uses nested clauses (e.g., *“he kanahā āhua ka nui o nā māla ‘elua”*) to emphasize the significance of the three plants. This structure is characteristic of Hawaiian *mākāhaka* texts, which often use repetition and elaboration to convey meaning.  

2. **Dialectical and Regional Terms**:  
   - *Huhuki*: A specific plant, possibly a type of *kākau* (a plant used in rituals).  
   - *Kapuahi*: Likely a sacred or ceremonial plant, reflecting the Hawaiian concept of *kapu* (sacredness).  
   - *Māla ‘elua*: The term *māla* (plant) with *‘elua* (three) indicates a classification system, possibly tied to agricultural or medicinal practices.  

3. **Dialogue and Pronouns**:  
   The dialogue between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i uses *“e ‘ōhinu ana”* (is growing) and *“e ‘ā ana”* (is growing) to describe the plant’s state, highlighting the importance of observation and description in Hawaiian oral traditions. The use of *“ia”* (to him/her) and *“kona”* (the one who) emphasizes the speaker’s role in the narrative.  

4. **Temporal and Spatial Markers**:  
   The use of *“laila”* (the next day) and *“kēia lā”* (that day) creates a temporal framework, a key feature of Hawaiian storytelling that situates events in a specific time and place.  

### **Conclusion**  
This passage is a microcosm of Hawaiian cultural practices, blending plant symbolism, ritual knowledge, and social dynamics. It reflects the oral tradition of *mākāhaka*, where plants, rituals, and community interactions are preserved through storytelling. The text’s structure and terminology highlight the importance of traditional knowledge systems in Hawaiian society, emphasizing the interplay between nature, spirituality, and human agency.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**  • The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;  **Paragraph 7:**  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",

All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?

Here’s a breakdown of its cultural, historical, and linguistic significance:  

### **Cultural Context**  
1. **Genealogical Lineage**: The passage emphasizes the importance of **lineage** in Hawaiian culture. The structure of the sentence (e.g., ""Nāmakaokalani is the father of Nāmakaokai‘a"") reflects the **genealogical hierarchy** central to Hawaiian identity, where ancestry and kinship determine status, authority, and social roles. This practice is rooted in the **ʻāina (land) and ʻāma (family) system**, where one’s place in the genealogy tree determines their position in society.  

2. **Royal Titles and Status**: The term **""ali‘i nui""** (great chiefs) underscores the **hierarchical structure** of Hawaiian society, where chiefs (ali‘i) held political and spiritual authority. The mention of **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** as the parent of Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a suggests a **lineage tied to a powerful royal family**, likely from the **Kamehameha dynasty** (a major historical lineage in Hawaiian history).  

3. **Ceremonial Language**: The phrase **""ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa""** (""Let me speak the names of these three"") is a **formal, ceremonial address**, common in **genealogical records** or **historical accounts**. This reflects the **oral tradition** of Hawaiian history, where genealogies were preserved through spoken or written records.  

### **Historical Significance**  
1. **Kamehameha’s Legacy**: The names **Nāmakaokalani** and **Nāmakaokai‘a** are likely **descendants of Kamehameha the Great**, who unified the Hawaiian Islands in the 18th century. The reference to **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** as their ancestor aligns with the **Kamehameha lineage**, a key figure in Hawaiian history. This passage may be part of a **genealogical record** documenting the **royal family tree**, which was critical for **political and religious authority**.  

2. **Colonial Context**: The 19th century saw **European colonization** and the **loss of Hawaiian sovereignty**, which disrupted traditional systems. Genealogical records like this were often **preserved by missionaries or scholars** (e.g., **Lorrain** or **Hale) to document Hawaiian culture before colonization.  

### **Linguistic Features**  
1. **Proper Nouns**: The names **Nāmakaokalani**, **Nāmakaokai‘a**, and **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** are **proper nouns**, reflecting the **personalization of history** in Hawaiian culture. The use of **long vowels** (e.g., *ō, a, o*) and **consonant clusters** (e.g., *kā, kā, kā*) is typical of Hawaiian phonology.  

2. **Genealogical Syntax**: The sentence structure (""Nāmakaokalani is the father of Nāmakaokai‘a"") uses **relative clauses** to clarify **parentage**, a feature common in Hawaiian genealogical texts. The phrase **""he mau ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i""** (""these are the great chiefs of Hawai‘i"") uses **""lāua""** (of) to specify the **geographic and political scope** of the chiefs’ authority.  

3. **Title and Role**: The term **""pule""** (used for **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**) is a **title or name**, possibly a **royal name** or **title of a chief**, reflecting the **duality of names** in Hawaiian culture, where individuals often have **multiple names** (e.g., a title, a personal name, and a lineage name).  

### **Conclusion**  
This passage is a **genealogical statement** that highlights the **importance of lineage, authority, and royal family** in Hawaiian society. It reflects the **cultural values** of **ancestry, hierarchy, and oral tradition**, as well as the **historical context** of the 19th century, a time of **colonial disruption** and **cultural preservation**. The text serves as a **cultural artifact** that connects **traditional Hawaiian identity** to **historical memory**.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**  • This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity. **Paragraph 9:**  • While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.  **Paragraphs 10—14**  • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture.",

Here’s a detailed breakdown:  

### **Cultural Context**  
1. **Lineage and Ancestry**: The text emphasizes the interconnectedness of individuals through lineage. ""Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" and ""Puali‘i"" are proper nouns likely representing ancestors or figures in a genealogical lineage. The phrase ""children of the child"" (ke ko‘i) underscores the importance of ancestry in Hawaiian culture, where identity is deeply tied to one’s lineage.  
2. **Spirituality and Sacred Time**: ""Luna pono"" (righteous time) references a sacred or divine period, aligning with Hawaiian concepts of *mākāhia* (sacred time) and *kāhuna* (spiritual leaders). This suggests the narrative is tied to a spiritual or ceremonial context.  
3. **Geographical and Sacred Places**: ""Kai o Waipouli"" (the sea of Waipouli) and ""kahakai o Honouliuli"" (the deep of Honouliuli) are likely specific locations in Hawaiian geography, possibly sacred or historically significant. These names reflect the integration of geography with cultural and spiritual meaning.  

### **Linguistic Features**  
1. **Syntax and Structure**:  
   - The sentence structure follows Hawaiian syntax, where the subject is often placed at the end (e.g., ""ke po‘o o Puali‘i"" = ""the people of Puali‘i"").  
   - The use of ""pau"" (all) and ""pane"" (originated) emphasizes completeness and origin, common in genealogical texts.  
   - The repetition of ""kona loa"" (the long) creates a rhythmic, poetic effect, typical of Hawaiian oral traditions.  
2. **Lexical Choices**:  
   - ""Aloha ‘oe"" is a standard greeting, central to Hawaiian culture, symbolizing respect and hospitality.  
   - ""Lālau akula"" (the children) and ""kiola akula"" (they went) highlight the relationship between people and their environment, reflecting the Hawaiian concept of *kākou* (our people).  
   - The phrase ""he ana ma kahakai"" (the place of the deep) uses metaphor to describe a sacred or spiritual location.  

### **Historical Significance**  
1. **Genealogical Texts**: The passage is likely from a *mākāhia* (genealogical) text, which were oral records of lineage, ancestry, and cultural history. These texts were preserved through storytelling and were crucial for maintaining social and spiritual identity.  
2. **Cultural Identity and Continuity**: The mention of specific names (Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Puali‘i) and locations (Waipouli, Honouliuli) reflects the importance of preserving cultural memory. The text may have been used in rituals, ceremonies, or to legitimize authority (e.g., a chief’s lineage).  
3. **Language and Oral Tradition**: The phrase ""‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē"" (the language comes from some place) suggests the text is part of a broader oral tradition where language itself is a cultural artifact.  

### **Symbolism and Themes**  
- **Ancestral Connection**: The text emphasizes the enduring bond between ancestors and descendants, a core value in Hawaiian culture.  
- **Spiritual Journey**: The reference to ""the sea of Waipouli"" and ""the deep of Honouliuli"" may symbolize a spiritual or migratory journey, reflecting the Hawaiian belief in the afterlife and the spiritual realm.  
- **Ritual and Ceremony**: The greeting ""Aloha ‘oe"" and the mention of sacred places suggest the text could be part of a ritual or ceremonial context, such as a *kākau* (ceremony) or *hula* (dance) performance.  

### **Conclusion**

It exemplifies how Hawaiian language and culture are deeply intertwined, with words and phrases carrying both literal and symbolic meanings. The text serves as a reminder of the importance of lineage, spirituality, and community in Hawaiian identity.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.",,"The chapter explores the intricate web of lineage, status, and power dynamics within Hawaiian society, emphasizing the interplay between individuals, their ancestors, and the natural and spiritual realms. Central to the narrative is the figure of **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**, a revered chief whose lineage and status are repeatedly referenced as markers of authority and identity. The text weaves together themes of **lineage and ancestry**, **political hierarchy**, and **cultural symbolism** (e.g., the sea, the moon, and the land) to reflect the values and structures of Hawaiian society.  

### Major Themes  
1. **Lineage and Ancestry**:  
   The chapter repeatedly emphasizes the importance of **lineage** in defining status and authority. Names like **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**, **Kauluakaha‘i**, and **Pōka‘ī** are tied to specific roles and territories, underscoring the **hereditary nature of leadership**. The text also highlights the **interconnectedness of individuals** through ancestry, as seen in the lineage of **Pōka‘ī** (a descendant of **Kauluakaha‘i**) and the descendants of **Puali‘i**.  

2. **Political Hierarchy and Status**:  
   The narrative portrays a **hierarchical social structure** where individuals are placed in specific **""states""** or **positions** (e.g., ""state of the child,"" ""state of the chief""). This reflects the **status of individuals** based on their role in society, such as **chiefs, commoners, and lineage groups**. The **""state of being""** is a recurring motif, symbolizing the **duty or responsibility** of individuals to their ancestors and the land.  

3. **Cultural Symbolism and Nature**:  
   The **sea**, **moon**, and **land** are central to the narrative, representing **spiritual and physical realms**. For example, **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** is associated with the **sea of Honouliuli**, and **Pōka‘ī** is linked to the **house of Pōka‘ī**. These symbols reinforce the **connection between human life and the natural world**, a key aspect of Hawaiian cosmology.  

4. **Conflict and Power Struggles**:  
   The text hints at **conflict** between individuals and groups, such as the **threat of Nāmakaokapāo‘o being killed** in the **""Making of 'Ama‘u""** section. This reflects the **tension between power and survival**, where leaders must navigate political and spiritual challenges.  

### Historical and Cultural Context

The **names** of individuals (e.g., **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**, **Kauluakaha‘i**) are not just personal identifiers but **symbols of lineage and authority**, reflecting the **importance of ancestry in Hawaiian culture**.  

The **sea** and **land** are **sacred elements** in Hawaiian culture, representing **life, fertility, and spiritual connection**.
