His father was a great chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he was also part god.","• **Paragraph 1: Introduction and Establishing Context**
    – This paragraph serves as a foundational introduction to the main characters and their origins, a common practice in Hawaiian narrative. It establishes not only physical attributes but also social standing and lineage, crucial elements for understanding relationships and plot.
    – **Nāmakaokapāo'o (keiki 'u'uku loa):** The description emphasizes his contrasting qualities – small stature alongside immense strength. This duality is significant; the seemingly delicate exterior belies a powerful inner nature. His name itself offers clues: ‘Nāmaka’ refers to the eyes of the pāo’o fish, a creature associated with the ocean and often seen as mischievous or elusive. ‘Kapāo’o’ implies a smallness or slenderness. The juxtaposition suggests a being who appears insignificant but possesses hidden power, which is a recurring motif in Hawaiian stories.
    – **Kauluakaha'i (makua kāne):**  His title as 'makua kāne' (father) immediately positions him as a figure of authority and lineage. His connection to Kahikipapaialewa is important; this place, described as ‘he ‘āina i Kahikinu’u’ (a land in Kahikinu'u), indicates a connection to a remote or perhaps even otherworldly realm.  ‘Kahikinu’u’ could imply a distant or hidden land, possibly a metaphor for a spiritual or ancestral realm.
    – **Pōka'ī (makuahine):** Identified simply as the mother, her role is established through her relationship to Kauluakaha'i and Nāmakaokapāo'o.  The phrase ‘He ali’i nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa, a he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona’ (His father was a great chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he was also part god) highlights the high social status of Pōka'ī's father.  The 'ao'ao akua (divine aspect/part god) is crucial; it suggests a lineage imbued with supernatural power or connection to the gods, influencing his descendants. This divine heritage likely extends to Pōka’ī and Nāmakaokapāo'o, contributing to their exceptional qualities.
    – The repetition of the possessive pronoun 'a'ohe ona lua ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau' (there was no one like him from Hawai'i all the way to Ni'ihau) emphasizes Nāmakaokapāo’o’s uniqueness and sets up a narrative expectation of extraordinary feats. The geographical scope—from Hawai’i to Ni’ihau—highlights his legendary status within the Hawaiian islands.","Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.","**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;","This narrative, as reconstructed from these fragmented passages, presents a complex mythological framework deeply intertwined with themes of power, lineage, land ownership, and the shifting political landscape of Hawai'i. The story’s significance lies not merely in its narrative content but also in its potential function as a post-contact narrative reflecting anxieties surrounding cultural change and political upheaval following the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. A thorough analysis reveals allegorical representations of power struggles and the contested legitimacy of leadership, particularly within the context of the 19th century’s transition from traditional Hawaiian society to Western influence.

The central figure, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, embodies a potent archetype – a being of immense physical strength juxtaposed with childlike innocence, potentially representing both primal force and vulnerability. His origin story connects him directly to the land of Hōʻaeʻae and his parents, Kauluakahaʻi (a semi-divine chief) and Pōkaʻī, grounding him in established Hawaiian cosmology and genealogy. The establishment of two sweet potato patches, named after Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, signifies the inextricable link between lineage, land tenure, and sustenance within Hawaiian society.  The act of cultivating these fields is not merely agricultural; it represents a claim to power and a continuation of ancestral connections to the land—a vital aspect of Hawaiian identity challenged by foreign encroachment.

Puali'i’s arrival and subsequent marriage to Pōkaʻī marks a pivotal turning point, introducing an element of external influence and initiating a narrative of potential conflict.  The initial power dynamics within this union are marked by a subtle challenge to traditional gender roles; however, the ensuing events dramatically shift the balance. Puali'i’s desire to kill Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o—motivated by a fear of being superseded or displaced– underscores a broader theme of anxieties surrounding succession and power transfer. The prayer Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o utters before his death is particularly significant. It invokes ancestral figures Nāmakaokalani (father) and Nāmakaokai’a (child), implicitly legitimizing his claim to leadership by connecting him to a lineage of powerful chiefs, while simultaneously expressing vulnerability and dependence on spiritual forces for protection. This prayer can be interpreted as an attempt to assert legitimacy in the face of a potentially hostile stepfather.

The story's progression from Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s death to his subsequent emergence as a formidable force – culminating in the destruction of those who sought to harm him and his eventual installation on the land of O'ahu – is highly symbolic.  This final act can be interpreted allegorically as a rejection of Puali’i’s patriarchal authority and a reassertion of a new order, potentially reflecting anxieties about the perceived threat posed by Western influence and Christianity which sought to supplant traditional Hawaiian leadership structures. The sheer number of canoes assembled by ‘Amaʻu (108) highlights the magnitude of the challenge Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o poses; his ultimate victory is not simply a personal triumph but a symbolic reclaiming of power and land from those who sought to diminish it.

The historical context of this narrative cannot be overstated. The story’s appearance in Hawaiian-language newspapers during the late 19th century—specifically *Ka Nūpepa Kū'oko'a* (1894) and *Ke Alaka'i o Hawai'i* (1917)—points to its likely creation as a response to the political and cultural upheaval following the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. The narrative can be interpreted as a veiled critique of the post-overthrow administration, providing an alternative vision of leadership based on strength, lineage, and connection to ancestral lands—values that were increasingly threatened by Western dominance.  The explicit inclusion of names like Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai’a is not accidental; it actively weaves a narrative of continuity with the past while implicitly challenging the legitimacy of those who had seized power in 1893.

The use of place names, such as Keahumoa (site of sweet potato cultivation) and Honouliuli (fishing grounds), further anchors the story within a specific geographical context, underscoring the importance of land to Hawaiian identity and sovereignty. The repetition of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s name in relation to these locations solidifies his connection to the land and reinforces his status as a powerful, indigenous figure.  The description of him tearing up sweet potato patches ""one above the other"" suggests both immense power and destructive force – characteristics that resonate with narratives of resistance against foreign occupation and cultural assimilation.

In conclusion, this narrative is far more than a simple story; it’s a complex tapestry woven from mythology, genealogy, and historical anxieties.  It offers a powerful example of how Hawaiian storytelling served as a vehicle for preserving cultural values, asserting sovereignty in the face of political change, and constructing alternative narratives of leadership and legitimacy during a period of profound transformation. The allegorical resonance of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s journey—from vulnerability to strength, from subjugation to triumph—makes this chapter an invaluable source for understanding the cultural and political landscape of post-contact Hawai'i."
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p2,1,2,"‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina, ma laila lāua i  launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o  Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","The land of Hōʻaeʻae was in ʻEwa, and so they became intimate and slept, and Nāmakaokapāoʻo was conceived. Pōkaʻī cherished Nāmakaokapāoʻo, and Kauluakahaʻi returned to his land, and Pōkaʻī resided there with her beloved, and afterward, she gave birth. With this birth, Pōkaʻī and her child, Nāmakaokapāoʻo, were very fortunate.","**Paragraph 2:** • This paragraph establishes the foundational moment of Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s origin within a specific geographical location – ‘Ewa. The emphasis on intimacy and sleep immediately sets the stage for his divine conception, linking his existence to the land itself. The phrase ""launa kino ai me ka moe 'ana iho"" is significant; it implies not just physical union but also a deep, almost spiritual connection that resulted in gestation.

– **‘Ewa:** This location is important as it's often associated with the transition between the earthly realm and the divine. It holds significance in many creation stories, representing a liminal space. 
– **Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s Conception**: The statement that Nāmakaokapāoʻo was ""conceived"" (launa kino ai me ka moe 'ana iho) is not simply biological; it signifies his divine origin and destiny intertwined with the land of ‘Ewa.

•  The subsequent actions highlight familial bonds and the nurturing aspect of Pōkaʻī, Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s mother. 
– **Pōkaʻī's Cherishing:** The word ""hāpai"" (to cherish, to favor) reveals a strong maternal bond, indicating that Pōkaʻī held Nāmakaokapāoʻo in high regard from the moment of his conception. This is a common theme in Hawaiian narratives, where mothers play a crucial role in shaping their children’s destinies.
– **Kauluakaha‘i's Return:**  Kauluakaha‘i returning to his land emphasizes ancestral lineage and the importance of family ties within Hawaiian society. It also provides a sense of grounding and stability to Pōkaʻī and Nāmakaokapāoʻo.

• The final sentence, ""With this birth, Pōkaʻī and her child, Nāmakaokapāoʻo, were very fortunate,"" is an assertion of blessing and destined prosperity. 
– **'Ilihune:**  The term 'ilihune (fortunate, blessed) is significant. It connects the birth of Nāmakaokapāoʻo with a sense of divine favor – implying that his arrival was not accidental but ordained. This foreshadows his future role as a powerful, albeit destructive, force within the Hawaiian narrative. 
– **Cultural Significance:**  The paragraph subtly hints at the importance of lineage and ancestral connection in determining one's fate. The prosperity associated with Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s birth links him to the well-being of his family and community.""","Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.","**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.",

I've given birth to a child and my body is ruined."" Puali'i said, ""I don't care about that. If you like me, let's sleep together."" Pōka'ī agreed and she went with Puali'i, now her man, to the plains of Keahumoa to live.","• **Paragraph 3:** A new character is introduced, Pua-li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu'e (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in 'Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-'ī was living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. – In the 'Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to every destination and it was normal to call in to the house of strangers and ask for food and water. It was normal to receive strangers at one's home and provide them with food and water, and it was considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the reason Pua-li'i called in at Pōka'ī's house and why Pōka'ī received Pua-li'i in her home, where he observed how she was living; 
• Pua-li'i falls in love with Pō-ka-'ī and proposes a longterm relationship. Pō-ka-'ī expresses hesitation due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li'i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and acknowledge each other as ʻkāne' (boyfriend, husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine' (girlfriend, wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu'e (Wāhiāwā), where Pua-li'i is from, to live; 
• It seems the meal Pua-li'i proposed, with the cooked head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of 'Ai Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their longterm relationship;

• **Name Analysis:**
    – *Puali'i*:  Derived from *pua* (flower, blossom) and *-li'i* (descendant, offspring), suggesting a connection to leadership or lineage. It implies he is a descendant of chiefs or has a noble standing. 
    – *Pōka'ī*:  The etymology is less direct but possibly linked to 'pō' meaning darkness, night, and 'kā'i' meaning to fall or descend. Could be interpreted as someone who carries the burden of darkness, hardship, or misfortune; potentially alluding to her current state after giving birth, or a deeper connection to ancestral suffering.

• **Cultural Context:**
    – The act of Puali’i seeking permission to enter Pōka'ī’s home and being received with hospitality reflects the importance of *ʻai kapu* customs during that period. It highlights a societal expectation of generosity and reciprocal relationships, especially when traveling. 
    –  The statement ""He mea 'ole ia mau mea"" (That doesn't matter) from Puali'i regarding Pōka'ī having given birth to a child and feeling diminished is significant. This implies he disregards the social stigma surrounding childbirth or perhaps views her differently than others might, potentially indicating deeper affection or admiration.

• **Symbolism & Interpretation:**
    – The immediate proposal of a relationship after observing Pō-ka-'ī's life suggests a directness that aligns with some historical portrayals of relationships in Hawaiian stories, where needs and desires were expressed openly. This contrasts with the more indirect courtship rituals prevalent in Western cultures.","The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that.

And the sweet potatoes, said Puali'i in his promise, “The head of the marlin is roasted with the sweet potato, and Puali’i eats, then his wife, Pōka'ī, and other things are eaten as well. Therefore, Puali'i went to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for food to eat with the sweet potato.","**Paragraph 4:** • This paragraph serves as a crucial link between Nāmakaokapāo'o’s earlier actions and his future role in the narrative. It establishes not only his lasting impact on the land but also foreshadows his relationship with Pōka'ī and Puali'i, deeply intertwined with sustenance and cultural practices. 

– **Nāmakaokapāo'o and the Sweet Potatoes:** The enduring presence of the sweet potato patches named after Nāmakaokapāo'o highlights a significant aspect of Hawaiian agricultural history.  The 'uala (sweet potato) was a staple food, particularly important during periods of scarcity or hardship, and its cultivation was deeply connected to mana (spiritual power). Naming the patches after him suggests that he either cultivated them himself or somehow became associated with their bounty – possibly reflecting his ability to transform or control the natural world. The ""long"" description of the sweet potato patches may allude to a particular variety known for its resilience, or perhaps symbolize an abundance of resources linked to Nāmakaokapāo'o’s presence.
– **Puali'i's Promise and Cultural Practices:** Puali'i's statement about eating roasted marlin with sweet potatoes is significant. The combination of marlin (ʻUla) and 'uala represents a specific meal, likely related to the ʻAi Kapu system.  The `āina (land) provides sustenance, and it must be obtained through proper protocols. 
    – **'Ai Kapu:** This refers to the ancient Hawaiian system of food restrictions and prohibitions designed to maintain balance and harmony within the community and with the gods. Certain foods were reserved for chiefs or priests, certain places were considered sacred and off-limits, and specific rituals had to be performed before consuming particular items. The mention of eating ""other things"" alongside the roasted marlin suggests a broader understanding of appropriate food consumption within the context of Hawaiian traditions—not just the strict prohibitions, but also the allowance for community feasts and sharing.
    – **Mālama ‘Āina:**  This phrase translates to ""to care for the land."" The cultivation of sweet potatoes by Nāmakaokapāo'o can be seen as an act of mālama 'āina – a responsibility to nurture and protect the resources provided by the `āina. 
– **Honouliuli and Fishing:** Puali’i going to Honouliuli (dark bay) to fish for food is another key detail. Fish, especially marlin, were highly valued in Hawaiian society.  Fishing was not merely a means of obtaining food but also a spiritual act connected to the ocean gods. The phrase ""food to eat with the sweet potato"" suggests that Puali’i understands these two staples as complementary – providing both sustenance and spiritual nourishment.
– **Name Etymologies:** 
    - Nāmakaokapāo'o:  This name literally translates to ""the eyes of the pāo'o fish."" The pāo'o is a type of fish that lives in the reef. It is interesting to note how this name connects him with marine life, and could allude to his ability to navigate both the land and sea realms, or perhaps an association with the ocean’s mysterious depths – and possibly also connected with the creation stories where certain deities are associated with particular creatures.
    - Puali'i:  Meaning ""descendant of a chief"" (a combination of *pua* - flower/descendant and *ali'i* - chief). This underscores his social status and role within Hawaiian society.","They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.","**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p5,1,5,"A hala ‘o Puali‘i i ka lawai‘a, i ia wā ‘o   Nāmakaokapāo‘o i hele ai me nā keiki he ‘umi  kumamāhiku i nā māla ‘uala a Puali‘i. ‘O ke kino o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ia wā, he kino ‘u‘uku loa, ‘elua  kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e, ‘a‘ole i pa‘a kona  ma‘i, e lewalewa ana nō.

Nāmakaokapāo'o’s body at that time was very small, two feet tall, and his illness was not steady, still unsteady. Until they reached the sweet potato field, then he instructed the children, “Tear up the shoots with all the sweet potato leaves on top, do not let any grow.” But the children were still young, so they only gently handled the sweet potatoes; there was no tearing of the shoots.","• **Paragraph 5: Introduction to Nāmakaokapāo'o and a depiction of childhood.** This passage provides crucial information about Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s physical state and behavior, setting the stage for his later actions. It highlights his small stature and unsteady health, which are repeatedly emphasized throughout stories, positioning him as an underdog figure who compensates with strength and determination. 

– **Name Etymology:** Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o literally translates to ""the eyes of the pāo'o fish."" The pāo'o is a type of fish known for its vibrant colors and quick movements in the water. This name could be interpreted as an allusion to his sharp vision, perhaps even prophetic insight, or it might reflect his unpredictable nature – like the darting fish. The ""eyes"" also implies keen observation and attentiveness.

– **Number Significance (Thirty-seven children):** The precise number of thirty-seven children is likely symbolic. Numbers in Hawaiian tradition often hold significance beyond their literal value. It may relate to specific ancestral lineages, or represent a cohort of individuals destined for certain roles within the narrative.  Without further context from the larger narrative, this remains open to interpretation but points towards a deliberate and meaningful numerical selection by Puali'i. 

• **The Instruction and Children’s Response:** The instruction to tear up the sweet potato shoots is significant. It connects directly with themes of land management and resource control – central to understanding Hawaiian culture. 

– **‘Ai Kapu Context:** The emphasis on tearing up the *pu'e* (shoots) and leaves is important in the context of ancient Hawaiian agricultural practices, particularly related to ʻAi Kapu. While this passage doesn’t explicitly mention ‘Ai Kapu, it alludes to the disruption of established patterns.  ʻAi Kapu were strict rules governing food preparation and consumption that often involved specific protocols for cultivating crops like sweet potatoes. Disrupting these systems could be seen as a challenge to the established order or an act of defiance against those who enforced them.

– **The Children's Hesitation:** The children’s gentleness in handling the sweet potatoes, rather than aggressively tearing up the shoots, is noteworthy. This suggests a degree of restraint and perhaps a reluctance to fully embrace the destructive task assigned by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. It hints at internal conflict within the group or a recognition that not all disruption is beneficial.

• **Allegorical Interpretation:**  This passage can be interpreted allegorically as representing a struggle for change and the challenges of implementing new ideas. 

– **Nāmakaokapāo'o as Agent of Change:** Nāmakaokapāo'o, despite his small stature and initial weakness, is presented as an agent of disruption—someone who seeks to dismantle existing systems.  The sweet potatoes represent a cultivated resource (perhaps representing tradition or established power structures) that he wants to uproot. 

– **The Children’s Representational Role:** The children can be seen as symbolizing the future generation – those who might inherit and implement new ways of doing things. Their reluctance to fully commit to destruction suggests a need for thoughtful, measured change rather than reckless abandonment of the past. This mirrors themes found in narratives that explore the tension between tradition and innovation.

– **The Unsteady Health:** Nāmakaokapāo'o’s unsteady health may represent his internal struggle with this disruptive role, highlighting the difficulty of enacting radical change.","When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.","**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",

Then Nāmakaokapāo'o went back and lit a fire to broil four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was broiling the vines, his stepfather came back and reached him and asked Nāmakaokapāo'o's mother, Pōka'ī: ""No."" Puali'i said, ""Yes, his head and eyes as food to go with the sweet potatoes that I'll eat today. So, today I will kill him.""","• This passage continues the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s disruptive actions and introduces a significant interaction involving Puali'i, offering insight into cultural values surrounding resource management, sacrifice, and the 'Ai Kapu system. 

– **Nāmakaokapāo'o's Actions:** The description of Nāmakaokapāo'o ""tearing apart"" the sweet potato patches is symbolic of his destructive nature and perhaps a rejection of established order or traditional practices. This action can be interpreted as a challenge to resource management, especially in relation to the 'Ai Kapu system (see below). 
– The quantity – forty mounds of leaves – emphasizes the scale of his disruption and highlights the potential impact on the community's food supply.

• **The Significance of the Sweet Potato:**  Sweet potatoes were a vital staple in the Hawaiian diet, and their cultivation was closely tied to societal well-being. The destruction of these patches is therefore not merely an act of vandalism but potentially a symbolic act of defiance or rebellion against existing norms.
– Cultivation practices often involved specific rituals and respect for the land ('āina). Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions could be viewed as disrespectful, disrupting the balance of nature and impacting future harvests.

• **The Role of Puali'i and Pōka'ī:** The arrival of Puali'i and his interaction with Pōka'ī is pivotal. 
–  Puali'i's willingness to accept Nāmakaokapāo'o’s destructive behavior, even offering a gruesome form of recompense (eating his head and eyes), suggests an understanding or acceptance of the underlying forces driving Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions. This could indicate that Puali'i believes this is a necessary consequence for disrupting the balance. 
– The fact that Pōka'ī answers ""No"" to Puali'i's question before Puali'i offers his solution further suggests her cautiousness and perhaps an awareness of the potential consequences of such actions. She may be hesitant to endorse violence or ritualistic sacrifice, even as a form of retribution.
– The fact that Puali’i is willing to kill Nāmakaokapāo'o, using the head and eyes to supplement his sweet potato meal, connects this passage to ancient Hawaiian practices.

• **The 'Ai Kapu System (Food Laws):**  This entire scene can be interpreted within the context of the 'Ai Kapu system, a complex set of rules governing who could eat what, when, and where.
    – The destruction of the sweet potato patches may symbolize a challenge to these established food laws. Perhaps Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions represent an attempt to dismantle or circumvent the restrictions imposed by 'Ai Kapu. 
    –  The offering of his head and eyes as food, though extreme, could be seen as a ritualistic act attempting to appease or restore balance disrupted by Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions. This is a disturbing inversion of usual rituals involving sacrifice for the gods – it’s an attempt at self-sacrifice connected to eating something considered sacred (the head and eyes).
    – The reference to “food” as a way to compensate, even through violent means, underscores the fundamental importance of sustenance in Hawaiian culture.

• **Allegorical Interpretation:** This passage can be interpreted allegorically as representing the tension between tradition and change. 
    – Nāmakaokapāo'o could symbolize disruptive forces or revolutionary ideas that challenge established norms and require significant sacrifice to manage or contain.
    – Puali’i, by accepting the violent solution offered, may represent a clinging to traditional methods of control, even if they are brutal and potentially unsustainable. 
    – The overall scene hints at a struggle for balance between upholding tradition ('Ai Kapu), acknowledging change (Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions), and ensuring community survival.  It’s a complex interplay of ideas reflected in the narrative.","At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”","**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;",

All the children then ran and stood at a distance to watch Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nā-makaokapāo'o: ""'Yes! Here is the knife in my hand, it is a tool to cut off your head today, and that head, and then I will roast it with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat it first, and then it will be at peace."" Nā-makaokapāo'o did not listen to these words of Puali'i, and then Puali'i spoke again, the second time. Puali'i was ready to cut off Nā-makaokapāo'o's head, at that time Nā-makaokapāo'o prayed for Puali'i’s death. Thus, he prayed: ""Only the eyes of my pāo'o are beloved, Be gentle, be steady, Should I eat, should I leave, Should I leave Nākukui'aimakaokalani, That is Nākukui'aimakaokalani, That is my chief husband, Nāmakaokai'a the great chief of Hawai'i, Go now, go only in haste, A man with a spear, The spear with a drum, Still die for Nā-makaokapāo'o.""","**Paragraph 7:** • This paragraph depicts a pivotal moment of confrontation and impending violence. It’s crucial to analyze the specific details within this scene to understand its symbolic weight.

– **The Knife and the Threat of Death**: The introduction of the knife is highly significant. In Hawaiian culture, the knife (*koʻili*) represents power, authority, and often a finality – the severing of ties or lives. Puali’i's explicit declaration of intending to cut off Nā-makaokapāo'o’s head is not merely a threat; it’s a symbolic act aimed at neutralizing Nā-makaokapāo'o’s destructive behavior and restoring order, albeit through violent means.

– **The Sweet Potato as a Symbol**: The sweet potato (*ʻuala*) plays multiple roles here. It represents sustenance, life, and the land itself.  Nā-makaokapāo’o's destruction of the patches is not just an act of vandalism; it’s a desecration of the food source, potentially symbolizing disruption of the natural order or spiritual imbalance. Puali'i’s intention to roast and eat the sweet potato with Nā-makaokapāo’o's head can be interpreted as an attempt to reclaim and repurpose what has been damaged – almost as if he’s attempting to absorb the destructive energy and redirect it toward a more controlled outcome.

– **The Prayer and its Significance:** The prayer recited by Nā-makaokapāo'o is exceptionally revealing. It contains several layers of meaning, echoing ancient Hawaiian beliefs and practices.
    *   **Nāmakaokai’a**: This refers to Nāmakaokai'a, the great chief of Hawai'i, who may be a reference to Pele, goddess of fire. The phrase could represent the idea that Nā-makaokapāo'o is asking for protection from powerful forces (like Pele).
    *   **Spear and Drum**:  The references to the spear (*ihe*) and drum (*pahu*) are highly evocative. These were integral parts of Hawaiian ritual, warfare, and communication. The combination suggests a call to action – perhaps invoking ancestral power or divine assistance in his defense. It might represent a plea for intervention from the gods on behalf of Nā-makaokapāo'o.
    *   **""Only the eyes..."":** This phrase is particularly striking. The eyes are often considered the windows to the soul, and by specifically mentioning them, Nā-makaokapāo'o may be implying that only his essence or spirit remains worth saving – a desperate plea for continued existence even in a diminished form.
    *   **“Die for Nā-makaokapāo’o”:** This phrase is also deeply significant because it highlights the importance of protecting oneself and one’s own identity, even if it requires sacrifice or confrontation.

– **Allegorical Interpretation: Restoration vs. Destruction**: The entire scene can be viewed allegorically as a conflict between restoration and destruction. Puali'i represents an attempt to restore order by eliminating what he perceives as a threat – the destructive force embodied by Nā-makaokapāo'o. However, Nā-makaokapāo’o’s prayer suggests a different perspective — a desire for survival, protection, and potentially, a re-evaluation of the existing power dynamics. It questions whether destruction is truly the only path to resolution.  It could also be an allegory about the need to respect the land, as Nā-makaokapāo'o’s destructive actions are linked to disrespecting the sweet potato patches – a vital food source and spiritual resource.

– **Historical Context:** Considering this passage within the broader historical context is important. While not directly referencing the ‘Ai Kapu era (a system of prohibitions relating to sacred foods), it indirectly touches on themes related to sustenance, land ownership, and societal responsibility that were central during that period. The disruption of food sources could be seen as a metaphor for disruptions in social order or spiritual harmony—concerns prevalent within the 'Ai Kapu framework.","Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o","**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p8,1,8,"(Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki no kēlā mau inoa ‘elua, ‘o  ia ‘o Nāmakaokalani a me Nāmakaokai‘a, he mau  ali‘i nui lāua no Hawai‘i, he makua kāne ‘o  Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a, akā, ua  komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","Here, let us briefly speak of those two names, they are Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, great chiefs both for Hawai‘i; Nāmakaokalani was a father and Nāmakaokai‘a was a child, but they entered into the time of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.","• This paragraph serves as an introductory note, providing context about two significant figures mentioned earlier or to be introduced later in the narrative. It’s a common practice in Hawaiian storytelling to offer such concise familial and societal information at the beginning of a section. 

– **Nāmakaokalani:** The name itself is a compound:
    – *Nāmaka*: ""wave,"" often associated with the ocean and the goddess of the sea, Nāmaka. This suggests a connection to powerful forces and potentially fluidity or change.
    – *kalani*: ""heaven,"" ""sky,"" or ""chiefly."" Thus, Nāmakaokalani can be interpreted as “chief of the waves” or ""he who rules over the heavens/sky (like the ocean)"". His status as a father signifies lineage and authority within Hawaiian society.

– **Nāmakaokai‘a:** This name is equally significant:
    – *Nāmaka*: Again, linking her to the sea and Nāmaka.
    – *okai‘a*: ""of the ocean."" Therefore, Nāmakaokai‘a means “of the ocean” or “belonging to the waves.”  Her status as a child establishes her position relative to her father and implies potential for growth or influence in the future narrative.

• The phrase ""ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o"" (they entered into the time of Nāmakaokapāo‘o) is particularly telling. 
    – *pule*:  This word has multiple meanings, including ""time,"" ""period,"" or “season,” but also carries connotations of sacredness and often refers to a specific era marked by significant events or changes. It can also relate to the time when a particular deity’s influence is strong.
    – This phrase implies that Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a’s story, or their influence, aligns with or is directly affected by the actions/events associated with Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  Given the context of the broader narrative (as implied in the previous examples), this strongly suggests a connection to themes of disruption, change, and potentially the dismantling of established social structures, like those linked to 'Ai Kapu practices as noted earlier. The “time” that they entered into with Nāmakaokapāo‘o could signify their participation or involvement in his actions – whether supporting, opposing, or being directly impacted by them.

•  The brevity of this paragraph suggests it's a foundational statement setting the stage for a broader narrative arc, highlighting key players and the time frame within which their destinies intertwine. It acts as a brief historical marker before diving into the core story.","(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)","**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
namakaokapaoo_ch1_p9,1,9,"A pau ka pule ‘ana a Nāmakaokapāo‘o, i ia wā i  ‘o‘oki ai ‘o Puali‘i i ke ko‘ilipi i luna pono o  Nāmakaokapāo‘o, e ho‘ohuli aku ā nā ‘oi o ke ko‘i  iā Puali‘i, moku ke po‘o, a ‘ōlelo mai i kahi ‘ē.

Puali'i looked at Nāmakaokapāo'o’s head and said, “I love you, Nāmakaokapāo'o.” Then Nāmakaokapāo'o leaned on Puali'i’s head and went to the sea of Waipouli, a bay on the shore of Honouliuli, and he was, in fact, five miles away.","**Paragraph 9:** • This paragraph marks a pivotal moment in the developing relationship between Nāmakaokapāo'o and Puali'i. The use of the *lei* is highly significant, moving beyond simple affection to a symbol of connection and intent. – In Hawaiian culture, the lei isn’t merely decorative; it’s a tangible expression of sentiment and often carries specific meanings depending on the materials used. A lei given with intention can solidify a bond or mark a transition in a relationship. • The act of turning the blossoms towards Puali'i emphasizes directedness - focusing affection and attention solely upon him. – This demonstrates a deliberate shift from previous interactions where Nāmakaokapāo’o was driven by impulse or destructive urges, to a more intentional engagement with Puali'i. • Puali’i’s address of “Aloha ‘oe” is not just a greeting; it’s a profound statement of affection and acceptance within the framework of Hawaiian social etiquette. – *Aloha* encompasses love, compassion, greeting, farewell, and much more. To say ""Aloha 'oe"" is to convey a deep level of care and acknowledgement of another's spirit. • Nāmakaokapāo’o leaning on Puali’i’s head suggests vulnerability and reliance. – This physical closeness reinforces the emotional connection forming between them and signifies a willingness to be nurtured and supported by Puali'i. • The detail about the distance (five miles) is likely not incidental. It establishes the geographical separation between Waipouli, where Nāmakaokapāo’o is located, and Honouliuli, from which Puali'i originated. – This could allude to a journey or a bridging of distances, both physical and metaphorical, as their relationship develops. The distance itself might symbolize overcoming obstacles or differences in background. • The passage subtly critiques the 'Ai Kapu (food restriction) system by presenting an unconventional romantic interest between two characters that previously had conflicting desires. This is because during periods of Ai Kapu, people were not allowed to engage in behaviors such as affection and love if it went against traditional customs and rituals.","When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.","**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength.",
