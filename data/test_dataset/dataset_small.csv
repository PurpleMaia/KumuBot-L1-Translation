"Ma keia kaao ana, ua olelo ia ke kino o Kana, he kino loihi loa, a he kino nui a weliweli ke nana aku. I kona hanai ia ana, ua panee kona kino i ka loihi, a ua panee no hoi kona hale o Halauoloolo; mai ke kuahiwi a kokoke i ke kai kona kino ka loihi, a pela iho la no ke ako ana o ka hale, o Halauoloolo.","In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo.","By this description, it is said that the body of Kana was a very slender body, and a large and very flexible body to look at. When he was a child, his body was like a lei, and his house of Halauoloolo was also like a lei; from the mountain to the sea, his body was like a lei, and the appearance of the house, Halauoloolo, was the same.","In this legend, it is said that the body of Kana was very long, and it was a large and awe-inspiring body to behold. As he was being raised, his body extended in length, and so did his house of Halauoloolo; his body stretched from the mountain to near the sea, and likewise, the roof of the house, Halauoloolo, extended in the same manner.","In this legend, it is said that Kana’s body was extraordinarily long—large and fearsome to behold. While he was being raised, his body stretched in length, and so did his house, Halauoloolo. From the mountain to nearly the sea was the span of his body, and thus it was as well for the house, Halauoloolo.","According to this story, Kana's body was described as being extremely long, and his body was large and terrifying to look at. During his childhood, his body was as long as the house of Halauoloolo, from the mountain to the sea his long body stretched, and that's how long the house of Halauoloolo was.","In this narrative, it is said that the body of Kana is a very tall and large body that is terrifying to behold. In its feeding, its body stretches long, and its house of Halauoloolo also stretches; from the mountain to the sea, its long body extends, and thus the structure of the house of Halauoloolo is described.","In this legend, it is said that Kana's body was extremely long, large, and terrifying to behold. As he was raised, his body stretched out in length, and likewise, his house, Halauoloolo, also extended. His body stretched from the mountain nearly to the sea, and similarly, the house Halauoloolo was built to match this length.","tags. Let me start by understanding the task.
