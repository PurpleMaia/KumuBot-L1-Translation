# Complex Analysis Evaluation Methodology

## Overview

This document details the methodology for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on the Hawaiian-English translation task with complex cultural and historical analysis. The evaluation focuses on three key components: translation quality, commentary depth, and summary interpretation.

## 1. Evaluation Components

### 1.1 Translation Quality
- **Metric**: Semantic accuracy compared to reference translation
- **Key Focus Areas**:
  - Preservation of Hawaiian names and cultural terms
  - Natural English fluency while maintaining meaning
  - Handling of metaphorical and poetic language
  - Accuracy in translating cultural concepts (e.g., 'Ai Kapu, ali'i, kapu)

### 1.2 Commentary Analysis
- **Metric**: Depth of cultural and historical understanding
- **Key Focus Areas**:
  - Recognition of 'Ai Kapu era references
  - Understanding of Hawaiian naming conventions and their meanings
  - Identification of allegorical elements
  - Academic rigor and use of appropriate citations
  - Structural organization of analysis

### 1.3 Summary Interpretation
- **Metric**: Recognition of colonial/political context
- **Critical Test**: Whether the model recognizes the story as:
  - A) Post-1893 pro-colonial propaganda (as suggested by reference)
  - B) Hawaiian resistance narrative
  - C) Traditional pre-contact narrative without political implications

## 2. Key Passages for Evaluation

### Passage 1 (Introduction)
- Tests understanding of genealogical storytelling conventions
- Evaluates recognition of divine ancestry claims
- Checks translation of character names and their significance

### Passage 5 (Sweet Potato Destruction)
- Tests understanding of symbolic actions
- Evaluates recognition of 'Ai Kapu violations
- Checks comprehension of age/maturity contradictions

### Passage 7 (Death Prayer)
- Tests translation of poetic/ritual language
- Evaluates understanding of prayer's allegorical meaning
- Checks recognition of cultural conflict themes

### Passage 10-14 (Conquest Narrative)
- Tests understanding of power dynamics
- Evaluates recognition of gendered violence themes
- Checks interpretation of political allegory

## 3. Critical Differentiators

### 3.1 Colonial Context Recognition
The most critical differentiator is whether models recognize:
- The story's first publication in 1894 (post-overthrow)
- *Ka Nūpepa Kū'oko'a*'s shift to pro-occupation stance
- The absence of pre-1893 references to this story
- The allegorical nature of the violent overthrow narrative

### 3.2 Allegorical Interpretation
Key question: Who does Nāmakaokapāo'o represent?
- **Correct (per reference)**: Western/colonial forces overthrowing Hawaiian authority
- **Common misinterpretation**: Hawaiian resistance to colonial forces
- **Naive interpretation**: Simple heroic narrative without political meaning

### 3.3 Gendered Analysis
Recognition of:
- Marginalization of female characters (Pōka'ī)
- Victorian patriarchal influences
- Contrast with traditional Hawaiian gender roles

## 4. Scoring Rubric

### Translation (40% weight)
- 95-100%: Exceptional accuracy with cultural sensitivity
- 90-94%: Very good with minor issues
- 85-89%: Good but missing some nuances
- Below 85%: Significant accuracy problems

### Commentary (30% weight)
- Exceptional: Deep cultural analysis with scholarly rigor
- Strong: Good understanding with some insights
- Adequate: Basic cultural comprehension
- Weak: Superficial or incorrect analysis

### Summary (30% weight)
- Exceptional: Correctly identifies colonial propaganda angle
- Strong: Recognizes colonial context but misinterprets
- Adequate: Traditional literary analysis
- Weak: No political/historical awareness

## 5. Application to Future Evaluations

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
1. Check if all required outputs exist (14 passages + summary)
2. Verify JSON format integrity
3. Note any missing or malformed responses

### Step 2: Translation Evaluation
1. Compare passages 1, 5, 7, 13 against reference
2. Note specific translation choices for cultural terms
3. Evaluate fluency and readability
4. Check handling of poetic/ritual language

### Step 3: Commentary Analysis
1. Read commentary for passages 1, 7, 10
2. Look for specific cultural references:
   - 'Ai Kapu system understanding
   - Hawaiian naming conventions
   - Allegorical interpretations
3. Evaluate scholarly depth and citations

### Step 4: Summary Critical Test
1. Read the full summary carefully
2. Look for key temporal markers:
   - Recognition of 1890s publication
   - Understanding of post-1893 context
3. Identify the model's interpretation:
   - Does it see propaganda or resistance?
   - Does it recognize political implications?

### Step 5: Synthesis and Ranking
1. Apply the scoring rubric
2. Weight components (40-30-30)
3. Create tier groupings based on critical differentiators
4. Document specific examples for each model

## 6. Red Flags and Common Pitfalls

### Translation Red Flags
- Literal translation of metaphorical language
- Loss of cultural terms or names
- Over-modernization of language

### Commentary Red Flags
- Anachronistic interpretations
- Lack of 'Ai Kapu understanding
- Missing allegorical analysis

### Summary Red Flags
- No mention of publication timing
- Treating story as authentic pre-contact narrative
- Complete absence of political analysis
- Inverting the colonial allegory

## 7. Documentation Requirements

For each model evaluation, document:
1. **Model identifier and version**
2. **Specific passages reviewed** (with passage numbers)
3. **Key quotes** demonstrating strengths/weaknesses
4. **Translation accuracy examples**
5. **Commentary insights or gaps**
6. **Summary interpretation** (A, B, or C from section 1.3)
7. **Overall tier placement with justification**

## 8. Quality Assurance

To ensure reproducibility:
1. Always review the same key passages (1, 5, 7, 10-14)
2. Quote specific text to support assessments
3. Compare against the reference interpretation
4. Document any ambiguous cases
5. Note if a model's interpretation could be valid from alternative perspectives

## Conclusion

The evaluation methodology prioritizes critical historical and political awareness over pure translation accuracy. A model that translates perfectly but misses the colonial critique is ranked lower than one with good translation and correct political interpretation. This reflects the importance of understanding not just language, but the complex cultural and historical contexts in which texts are produced and circulated.
