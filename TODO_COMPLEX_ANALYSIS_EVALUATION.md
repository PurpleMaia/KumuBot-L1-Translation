# TODO: Complex Analysis Evaluation Implementation

This document outlines the tasks needed to implement comprehensive evaluation metrics for the complex Hawaiian passage analysis task (translation + commentary + summary).

## High Priority Tasks

### Task 9: Create Multi-Component Semantic Similarity Evaluator
- [x] Create `benchmarking/complex_semantic_similarity.py`
- [x] Implement separate embedding generation for:
  - [x] Translation components
  - [x] Commentary components  
  - [x] Summary components
- [x] Compare each component against its reference independently
- [x] Generate component-specific similarity scores
- [x] Handle missing/partial components gracefully
- [x] Support batch processing for efficiency

### Task 10: Design Translation Quality Scoring for Complex Analysis
- [x] Implement semantic similarity specifically for Hawaiianâ†’English translations within complex passages
- [x] Account for passage context and cultural nuances
- [x] Compare model translations against reference translations paragraph by paragraph
- [x] Handle multi-paragraph translation scoring with weighted averages
- [x] Create translation-specific quality metrics:
  - [x] Semantic accuracy
  - [x] Cultural preservation
  - [x] Fluency scoring

### Task 11: Implement Commentary Quality Evaluation Using LLM Judge
- [x] Design LLM judge prompts for evaluating cultural/historical commentary quality
- [x] Implement evaluation criteria:
  - [x] Cultural accuracy (1-5 scale)
  - [x] Historical context depth (1-5 scale)
  - [x] Linguistic analysis quality (1-5 scale)
  - [x] Academic rigor (1-5 scale)
- [x] Create rubric-based scoring system
- [x] Generate detailed feedback on commentary strengths/weaknesses
- [x] Handle rate limiting for LLM judge API calls
- [x] Store evaluation results in structured format

## Medium Priority Tasks

### Task 12: Create Summary Coherence and Completeness Metrics
- [ ] Evaluate how well summaries capture main themes from all passages
- [ ] Check for logical flow and thematic synthesis
- [ ] Measure completeness against reference summaries:
  - [ ] Key theme coverage
  - [ ] Important detail retention
  - [ ] Conclusion quality
- [ ] Score clarity and accessibility of academic content
- [ ] Implement summary-specific metrics:
  - [ ] Coherence score
  - [ ] Completeness percentage
  - [ ] Synthesis quality rating

### Task 13: Build Composite Scoring System for Overall Analysis Quality
- [ ] Design weighting system for different components:
  - [ ] Translation quality: 40%
  - [ ] Commentary quality: 40%
  - [ ] Summary quality: 20%
- [ ] Create overall quality score calculation
- [ ] Generate comparison matrices across different models
- [ ] Implement statistical analysis:
  - [ ] Mean scores per component
  - [ ] Standard deviation
  - [ ] Confidence intervals
- [ ] Provide actionable insights for model improvement
- [ ] Create model ranking system

### Task 14: Create Benchmarking Reports for Complex Analysis Outputs
- [ ] Design report template with component breakdowns
- [ ] Implement visual comparisons:
  - [ ] Bar charts for component scores
  - [ ] Radar charts for multi-dimensional analysis
  - [ ] Heat maps for model comparisons
- [ ] Generate detailed analysis sections:
  - [ ] Model strengths by component
  - [ ] Model weaknesses and areas for improvement
  - [ ] Comparative analysis across all tested models
- [ ] Create executive summaries for model performance
- [ ] Export reports in multiple formats (MD, PDF, HTML)

## Low Priority Tasks

### Task 15: Integrate Complex Analysis Evaluation into run_pipeline_v2.sh
- [ ] Add evaluation step to `run_pipeline_v2.sh` for complex analysis
- [ ] Ensure seamless workflow from translation to evaluation
- [ ] Create command-line options for:
  - [ ] Selective component evaluation
  - [ ] Custom weighting configurations
  - [ ] Report format selection
- [ ] Implement automated report generation
- [ ] Handle error cases gracefully:
  - [ ] Missing reference data
  - [ ] API failures
  - [ ] Incomplete outputs
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running evaluations
- [ ] Create evaluation summary in pipeline output

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies
- Existing semantic similarity infrastructure from simple translation evaluation
- OpenAI embeddings API (or alternative embedding service)
- LLM judge API access (GPT-4 or similar)
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations

### Data Requirements
- Reference translations for all passages
- Reference commentary from human experts
- Reference summaries for overall context
- Properly formatted complex analysis outputs from models

### Success Criteria
- All components can be evaluated independently
- Composite scores accurately reflect overall quality
- Reports provide actionable insights for model improvement
- System handles edge cases without failing
- Evaluation process is reproducible and consistent
