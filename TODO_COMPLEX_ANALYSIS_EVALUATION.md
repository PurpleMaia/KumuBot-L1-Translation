## Commentary Quality Improvement Recommendations

### Analysis of Reference vs Model Commentary Patterns

Based on analysis of the reference commentary and current model outputs, several patterns emerge that explain the ~68% commentary similarity scores:

#### **Key Differences Identified:**

1. **Structure & Organization**:
   - **Reference**: Uses numbered bullet points (‚Ä¢) with clear hierarchical structure
   - **Models**: Use academic essay format with headers and sections
   - **Impact**: Different organizational patterns reduce semantic similarity

2. **Content Focus**:
   - **Reference**: Highly specific allegorical interpretation (e.g., "NƒÅ-maka-o-ka-pƒÅo'o represents progressive-minded Hawaiian")
   - **Models**: General cultural/historical context without specific allegorical claims
   - **Impact**: Models miss the interpretive depth that characterizes the reference

3. **Citation Style**:
   - **Reference**: Includes specific academic citations (e.g., "Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114)")
   - **Models**: Rarely include specific citations or footnote references
   - **Impact**: Missing scholarly apparatus reduces similarity to academic reference style

4. **Specific Details**:
   - **Reference**: Includes precise contextual details (e.g., "'Ai Kapu era," "post-1820 Protestant Christian bias")
   - **Models**: Often provide general cultural context without specific historical periods
   - **Impact**: Less precise temporal and cultural grounding

#### **Recommended Prompt Improvements:**

### Task 15a: Enhanced Commentary Prompt Template

```
Please analyze the following Hawaiian passage and provide commentary that follows this specific structure:

**Paragraph {paragraph}:**
‚Ä¢ [Bullet point 1: Character/plot analysis with allegorical interpretation]
  ‚Äì [Sub-point: Cultural/historical context with specific time periods]
‚Ä¢ [Bullet point 2: Linguistic/cultural practices analysis]
  ‚Äì [Sub-point: Specific cultural concepts with Hawaiian terms]
‚Ä¢ [Bullet point 3: Historical significance and symbolism]
  ‚Äì [Sub-point: References to specific cultural eras like 'Ai Kapu period]

Requirements:
1. Use bullet points (‚Ä¢) and sub-points (‚Äì) for organization
2. Include specific allegorical interpretations where characters represent broader concepts
3. Reference specific historical periods (e.g., 'Ai Kapu era, post-1819, post-1820)
4. Include Hawaiian cultural terms in italics with brief explanations
5. When possible, reference scholarly sources (Pukui, Elbert, Haertig, etc.)
6. Focus on symbolic meaning beyond literal interpretation
```

### Task 15b: Include Reference Examples in Prompts

Add exemplar commentary excerpts to guide model behavior:

```
Example of expected commentary style:

"**Paragraph 3:**‚Ä¢ A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described as a good man, arrived from inland at Lƒ´hu'e (WƒÅhiƒÅwƒÅ)...
‚Äì In the 'Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to every destination and it was normal to call in to the house of strangers..."
```

### Task 15c: Specific Cultural Context Requirements

```
Your commentary must address:
1. **Allegorical Interpretation**: What do characters/events symbolically represent?
2. **Historical Period Context**: Reference specific eras ('Ai Kapu, post-contact, etc.)
3. **Cultural Practices**: Explain specific Hawaiian customs mentioned
4. **Linguistic Analysis**: Hawaiian terms, name meanings, cultural significance
5. **Scholarly Grounding**: Reference established Hawaiian cultural scholarship when relevant
```

### Task 15d: Implement Few-Shot Learning Approach

- Include 2-3 complete reference commentary examples in the prompt
- Show the exact bullet-point structure and allegorical interpretation style
- Demonstrate the level of specific cultural detail expected

### **Expected Impact:**
- Improve commentary similarity from ~68% to target 75-80%
- Better alignment with academic Hawaiian cultural scholarship
- More consistent structural organization matching reference style
- Enhanced allegorical and symbolic interpretation depth

### Task 15e: Additional Prompt Refinements Based on Testing

**Testing Results with Initial Improvements:**
- qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui showed improvement in the latest runs:
  - Original prompts: Commentary 0.6729, Translation 0.8589, Summary 0.7722
  - Improved prompts: Commentary 0.6855 (+0.0126), Translation 0.8298 (-0.0291), Summary 0.7747 (+0.0025)
  - Few-shot prompts: Commentary 0.7182 (+0.0453), Translation 0.8512 (-0.0077), Summary 0.7031 (-0.0691)

**Issues Identified in Generated Output:**
1. **Bracketed Headers**: Model added [bracketed headers] not present in reference
2. **Speculative Interpretations**: Some allegorical meanings were too speculative
3. **Missing Citations**: While concepts were mentioned, specific citations were absent
4. **Over-structured**: The prompt may be too prescriptive, affecting natural flow

**Key Findings:**
1. **Few-shot learning achieved best commentary results** (0.7182) - a 4.5% improvement over original prompts
2. **Trade-off between components**: Improved commentary came at the cost of translation accuracy and summary quality
3. **Improved prompts showed balanced results** with modest gains in commentary without major losses elsewhere

**Recommended Refinements:**

1. **Remove Bracketed Header Instruction**:
   - Don't include [brackets] in example structures
   - Let bullet points flow naturally without headers

2. **Ground Interpretations More Concretely**:
   ```
   When providing allegorical interpretations:
   - Base interpretations on known Hawaiian cultural concepts
   - Connect to established mo'olelo (story) traditions
   - Avoid speculative meanings without cultural grounding
   ```

3. **Simplify Citation Guidance**:
   ```
   Include citations where you have specific knowledge:
   - Hawaiian dictionaries (Pukui & Elbert)
   - Cultural texts (NƒÅnƒÅ I Ke Kumu)
   - Historical sources
   Don't invent citations, but reference known works when relevant
   ```

4. **Balance Structure with Natural Flow**:
   ```
   Use this structure as a guide, not a rigid template:
   ‚Ä¢ Main cultural/historical points
     ‚Äì Supporting details and context
   ‚Ä¢ Linguistic analysis where relevant
     ‚Äì Etymology and meanings
   
   Focus on matching the analytical depth rather than exact formatting
   ```

5. **Add Negative Examples**:
   ```
   Avoid:
   - Generic cultural statements without specifics
   - Modern interpretations not grounded in tradition
   - Over-analyzing every detail
   - Headers or labels for sections
   ```

6. **Consider Prompt Length**:
   - Current enhanced prompt may be too long
   - Consider creating a shorter, more focused version
   - Test both detailed and concise versions

### Task 15f: Alternative Prompting Strategies

1. **Chain-of-Thought Approach**:
   - First ask for name etymology analysis
   - Then cultural/historical context
   - Finally allegorical interpretation
   - Combine into bullet-point format

2. **Reference-Guided Generation**:
   - Provide one full reference example
   - Ask model to match style and depth
   - Less prescriptive about exact structure

3. **Component-Specific Prompts**:
   - Separate prompts for translation vs commentary
   - Allow more focused generation for each
   - May improve both components
