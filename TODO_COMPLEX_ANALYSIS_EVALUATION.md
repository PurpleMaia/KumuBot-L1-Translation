# TODO: Complex Analysis Evaluation Implementation

This document outlines the tasks needed to implement comprehensive evaluation metrics for the complex Hawaiian passage analysis task (translation + commentary + summary).

## Hybrid Approach Implementation Status (✅ COMPLETED)

The hybrid complex analysis approach has been successfully implemented:
- ✅ All 14 passages processed with 100% success rate
- ✅ Fixed commentary extraction (14/14 passages have commentary)
- ✅ Implemented robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- ✅ Created new extraction script for hybrid outputs
- ✅ Successfully tested with real model (qwen3-4b-awq-40k-maui)
