[ ] When the dogs were cooked they were placed before the goddesses, together with the iholena bananas; and after the king had offered a prayer to them, the priest of the House of Papa declared the restrictions to be lifted, and they were free from all restraint this day. After nine days the king and the priests again went to the temple, and in the evening of Mohalu (when the moon was twelve nights old), entered it. Two men were stationed there. The high priest picked up two coconuts, and standing called upon the god Lono saying: “O Lononuiakea, here are the coconuts. Safety to thine attendant (or keeper), and to the land, and to the people.” These were the nights of Hua . And when the priest had offered the petition to the deities, and had thrown the coconuts (to the men), one from each hand, he sat down, all joining in the supplication. The two men then stood up calling with loud voices, feeding the stars and the moon this very same night. The king then offered pig and coconut to the deities after which they left the temple. And when they had gone on the outside it was dark, so they rested that night. They expressed approval during the night, and the hearts of all the people were thankful, for they said: “The king’s gifts of coconuts were good; the country is indeed safe.”"}]}

Koolau was robbed and turned to the cliffs, Transforming upon Kamahualele. Quickly arises malamalamaiki, a wind. Kalawakua stands here; At Kalalau the mended bones were again broken. 45.

Except Puna, broken by the wind, Filled, satisfied by the comfort of Makaiki Up above Koholalele, there was slaughtering In all the lands at Mailehuna. 50. Twisted about [is] the kalukalu (grass) of Kapaa, Spreading over the breadth of Kaipuhaa, The depth, the width of Kewa. Broken up by the kiuwailehua wind, Cleared at the Koolau plain of the thatch, 55. Perhaps so, without deceit of future revealing. Fading, shadowy is Kaluwai Pressed by the fountain of the chief Kuua, Touched and held with love water, [ ] Simply resting at Koamano. 60.

Moi was the priest of Kapeepee, Here is the fault of this chief, He took the wife of Hoakalanileo, The father of Kana. Then Moi slept in spirit; 5. He saw Niheu coming towards him With a wooden pike, And brandishing his mantle, but did not turn away. Kana thereupon called to him from heaven, Bidding him turn thither. 10. Thereafter that man thrust his hands And turned his mantle the other side out, Wherefore Moi dreaded this man Lest he should push the mountain down. Then Moi awoke with a shiver 15. And said unto the chief, chanting forth: Heedest thou the prediction? [ ] Who is the chief deaf at the hidden language, In the dream of me, the priest, in the day time? The land flees, the frames are thrown into confusion. 20. Yield my younger brother, for the drums stand in line, The fences are being overleaped, the unus are being given to destruction; The moi is being lifted to the altar whereon is the banana of Palila. The sun has risen above the mountain; It rose, with eyes like the moon in brightness. 25. In his view he fled, As if the eyes belonged to the aloa. The earth was lightened [by his eyes], The fowls quarreled in the night. The great moving body that conquered through reinforcement. 30. It’s being so the land was heated. The coconut grove is by the sea; The kalo patch is in the upland; The fish-pond of Molokai is in front. The coconut of Mauluku, of Mauluko. 35.

Nihoa is a land whereto the soldier returned, 40. [ ] Kapeepee, the warrior of Haupu. Ye above, fight not longer, Lest ye be dead and defeated, The heavenly multitude are all conquered; They have all been struck down. 45. They all rose up; They are all knocked down; They are all killed. The mist cloud has appeared, Should a cloud be seen, ’tis on Molowekea. 50. If the girdle was seen ’twas at Haupu, The bosom was at Kalawao, The back was at Helaniku. Kana traversed the golden sand of Kane: Hooila is this season. 55. Mokapu arose and his train saw him to be a man. The end of it. The kingdom became Nua’s According to the dream of the priest. ’Tis the first instance where cowardice was felt; 60. Haupu is trembling as if with cold. [ ]"}]}

Strangely lofty is this heaven, This very heaven which separates the seasons of heaven; Trembling is the point below; Moving are the gills, the fins, the head of the earth; Exclaiming are the hosts, the multitude of gods. 5. Turned is the face of the god toward the visible heaven; [He] turned and stamped upon Kahiki. Extended be the sacred worship of Lono; Extended through Kahiki and worshiped. Budding are the leaves of Lono; 10. Turn hither the image of the god; Turn hither within Maewa-lani; Sound the leader within Papa-ia-mea. The heavens are silent; The eyes of Lono have seen Kahiki. 15. The rays of light shine forth; ’Tis Ikuwa, Makalii, ’Tis Hinaiaeleele, Hilinehu, ’Tis Kaelo, Kaaona the month. Lono sickened with pregnancy, 20. The month suffered intensive pains, The placenta was agitated, The travail prevailed in Hinaiaeleele. The cord of Papa-ia-mea trembled. The leaves of Lono are scattered; 25. The image of Lono is placed for devotion, [To] stand till it falls to the foundation of the land; Bending low is the glory; Covered is the god by the heaven; That heaven is established. 30. Covered is the god by the earth’s strata. Squeaking is the voice of the alae within Kanikawi; Cracking is the voice of the thunder; Cracking within the shining black cloud; Broken are the mountain springs below; 35. The god returns and dwells in the clefts; The god returns and dwells in obscurity; [ ] The god Lono returns and dwells in the mire. Sounding is the voice of the shell; Sounding above is the voice of the overthrow; 40. Sounding excitedly is the voice of the birds; Creaking is the voice of the trees in the forest. Here is your bird-body, O Lono! Whirling up the dust in the heavens; The eyes of Lono glance to Hoomo’s altar; 45. He dwells here in the space of the land. Growing is the body high toward heaven; Passed are the former blustering winds. The first-born children of Hinaiaeleele. May I be saved by thee, O Lono, my god! 50. Saved by the supporting prayer! Saved by the holy water! Saved to offer sacrifice to thee, O god! Here is the sacrifice, a voice offering. [ ]"}]}

Unstable are the heavens; Makakulukahi has fallen; The stars are placed in the upper space. Approaching are the footsteps of Kahiki; Broken are the kamahele branches of the god; 5. Shattered is the brittle stone; Strewn are the pieces in Haehae, Else numberless gods enter. The body of Lono has changed into glory. The kanawao grows in the moist earth; 10. The body of that tree stands in high heaven, Established is the holy assembly of Lono in the distant sacred place. [ ] The voice of man is forbidden; Here is the soul within Kulu-wai-maka-lani; The soul within the smooth bones of the god. 15. Here are the sacred signs of the assembly: The voice of thunder bursts forth; Flashing are the rays of the lightning; The earthquake shakes the earth; The smoky cloud and the rainbow appeareth; 20. The heavy rain and high wind prevails; The whirlwinds sweep beneath the earth; Rocks adjoining the streams are moved; The red mountain-streams rush to the sea. Here are the waterspouts; 25. Tumbled about are the cluster clouds of heaven; Gushing forth are the springs in the cliffs. One eye has the god; Two, four eyes, to see clearly behind him. Greatly revered be the voice of my god in the heavens. 30. It has been inspired within Papa-iakea, Dwelling within the Maka-kolu-kolu-kahi. The kapu of Lono reaches to Kahiki, It goes to overthrow the kapu of Kahai, Sacrificing the kapu of Kahai on the altar; 35. It has fallen and tumbled in confusion. Dead are the fish, fallen in their flight; Fallen disfigured all through Kahiki; Kahai is stirring up the pelting rain; Kahai is beating the surface of the earth. 40. Here is Lono the bone of salvation and glory; The bone placed in the clear sky. Indistinct is the voice of the god, Indistinct through the single-breasted surf. My god was shark-born; 45. Shark-born in [the month] of Hinaiaeleele. May I be saved by my fullness of prayer! Saved by the life-offering! Saved by my devotion! By thee, O god! 50. [ ]"}]}

When the time of Pilate came, The enemies of this world greatly increased. Judas betrayed his Lord. Jesus was the light of the world, He was hung on the cross 25. And pierced with the wicked spear. Jesus’ teachings were of lasting good. The first-born of God was slain, The sinless one, With head bowed down to the earth 30. Jesus prayed to the Father, O Father, O Father!

The sun and moon wept, The heaven was veiled in darkness, The clouds wept for Jesus, The darkness fell down at his feet. Jehovah divided the waters of heaven, 40. The Messiah returned in his glorious chariot, Saying unto his disciples: I am going to heaven, To the bosom of my Father, And will send you a teacher. 45. Jesus departed with the power of the Spirit. His fame went all abroad, Jesus was the soldier of Kawaluna. The land trembled with fear of the multitude; Together they fled in dismay 50. At the revelation of the great day of Jesus. Compassionate art thou, O Jesus, Who died to save us. Ours was the guilt for which the Lord died. By his death 55. Once only was that sacrifice for sin.

O Lahainaluna, love to you, Where wise men have dwelt, There were our hearts made ever glad With the shady trees of your grounds Where your brethren encamp around thee. 15. O Lahainaluna, love to you, The shelter of the learned. You have found a new chief For the residents. From you have come forth 20.

There you are at the Isthmus of Darien, Overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. 40. O Lahainaluna, I love you. You are the sounding twine of the shoemaker; You are the sledge hammer of the blacksmith; You are the compass of the navigators; And the mud-hen singing at mid-night. 45. I heard a noise while asleep and awoke, O Lahainaluna, I love you. You were a hunch-back among the chiefs; You were the consulting companion of the two winds, The moae and the hauapepee . 50. They are the originators of the kona, To hide away your love Across to the stormy sea of Cape Horn. O Lahainaluna, I love you; Thou art the misty rain of Lilikoi 55. That is agitating my heart. You have seen Waialeale, You were delighted with the water of Haunu, Lovely Kaala sublime in its beauty, It was the beauty of the land, 60. You are the fragrant flower of Ainahau, that is kissed in all lands. In the midst of people, and the jungle of Africa. I love the lehua blooming on the plain, Satisfied in the sojourn that was blessed by the red rain, Murmuring at Kanehoa. 65. You was a friend in time of trouble at Lahainaluna, Just like the pervading of perfumes Flying over to the calm of Lele. I jumped to embrace you, but could not find you You were at Ieheulani. 70. Beautiful lies the field of Kaiwiula. O Lahainaluna, I love you, The greatest in the Kingdom of Hawaii nei. March 30, 1853. [ ]"}]}
