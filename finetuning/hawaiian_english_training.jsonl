At the end of their weeping Piikea asked: \u201cHow are you getting along with your brother?\u201d Kihapiilani answered his sister, saying: \u201cWe do not get along at all; my brother ill-treats me; he gets angry, abuses me, and has no love for me. That is why I have come to you, to tell you of these things.\u201d When Piikea heard this, she cried in a loud voice, recounting their life in their early days while living with their parents and of their childhood wanderings here and there, carefree and happy. While Piikea was wailing, Umi, who was in another house, heard it and he wondered why his wife was crying; but after a while he was told that it was because his brother-in-law, Kihapiilani had arrived. Soon after [ ] this Piikea came out of her house, still crying in a loud voice, and began disrobing and acting the part of one bereft of her mind. In doing this, Piikea was but acting her part; she had her senses about her all right enough, but she did this to impress on her husband Umi that a very great wrong had been committed, to rouse him to action."}]}

Pumaia in the meantime had moved on to Pawaa, where he was met by Kualii and his men, and another battle was fought in which Pumaia again slew all the chiefs and warriors, with the exception of Kualii and his god. When Kualii saw that his men and chiefs were all slain he prayed to his god to capture Pumaia, and so through the power of this god Pumaia was caught and bound. Kualii was so incensed at Pumaia that he was immediately killed and was dragged to Kapua where his dead body was thrown into the pit with the men he had killed. In the course of the ill treatment given his body, the jaws were crushed and cut up into fragments."}]}

It was his duty as runner to bring (awa ) fish from Hana for the king. When a meal was about ready, Eleio would set out for Hana to bring fish and he would always return before the king sat down to eat. Once while he was on his way back, he met on the road Kaahualii, a spirit, who asked him for some fish.

Upon coming by Kamaalaea, Eleio\u2019s sister who was residing at this place saw that her brother was out of breath, so she took down her pau and exposed herself to the spirit. This action so shamed the spirit that it abandoned Eleio. The name of this sister of Eleio was Pohakuloa. Being chased by this spirit on three different occasions along this same road, Eleio upon his next return trip went around the west side of Hana by way of Kaupo. Upon his arrival at Kaupo one day he found a woman by the name of Kanikaniaula sitting by the roadside, but he passed right along without noticing her. Kanikaniaula at this want of respect on the part of Eleio called out after him: \u201cSay, are you going to pass right along without greetings?\u201d When Eleio heard this call he turned back and greeted her.

This was done so often that the trees became scarce in the district of Lele. At last the father Kakaalaneo, took pity on the people knowing that they would some day go hungry; so he ordered that all the boys be sent home to their parents, believing that this would make his son less mischievous; but instead of improving he grew worse.

So the spirits and Kaeha proceeded to where a swing was rigged up, when they remarked to Kaeha: \u201cYou take the first ride while we push the swing for you.\u201d While this conversation was going on, Kaulu arrived and in a cunning way said: \u201cSay, if you all wish to take a ride on the swing, I will pull the [ ] rope.\u201d He then proceeded to instruct them how to ride the swing. \u201cIn my country we ride the swing by sitting facing one another to the full length or top of the rope; then the swing is pulled and the pleasure begins.\u201d In this way all those spirits were killed, by the swing breaking. When the remaining spirits saw this trick played on them by Kaulu, they thought they would get even with him by again enticing Kaeha to go with them for rod-fishing. On this fishing excursion Kaeha was killed and he was put in the shell of a bitter opihi, the kind that sticks to the smooth boulders. On missing Kaeha, Kaulu went in search of him until he discovered him in an opihi; but on account of its smooth surface he was unable to get the opihi from the boulder, so he urinated on the opihi, which released Kaeha. This action caused all the opihi of this kind to become bitter to this day, and it has always been known from that day as the bitter opihi. After Kaeha was brought to life again by Kaulu they returned to live on Oahu. When they arrived at Papakolea, Moanalua, Kaulu left Kaeha at this place while he continued on his way to Kapalama in search of Haumea. Haumea was a spirit that lived at Niuhelewai, Oahu. It was a female spirit. Upon the arrival of Kaulu he found Haumea asleep. Kaulu then called: \u201cSay, Haumea, why don\u2019t you get up, cook your food and afterwards fight with Kaulu?\u201d Haumea then sat up while Kaulu returned home and then flew up to Makalii who asked him: \u201cWhat is it you want, Kaulu?\u201d \u201cI have come for the net. Give it to me so that I will be able to kill Haumea.\u201d Makalii then gave him his nets, Maoleha and its mate. Kaulu then returned and again found Haumea asleep. Kaulu then surrounded the house with the nets, after which he called out to Haumea: \u201cAre you to continue on sleeping? Why don\u2019t you get up and let us fight?\u201d Haumea then woke up and tried this way and that to get out of the house. Kaulu kept at some distance away from the house and ran around it. At seeing Kaulu running around, Haumea attempted to get after him and was entangled in the net where she was caught and killed. Kaulu then went for Kaeha and they returned to Kailua [Oahu] their birthplace where their parents were then living."}]}

This shell was blown every night and the sound from it made Hakau angry. So he said to the master of Pupualenalena: \u201cI will, however, save you and your dog if you will get me the shell owned by the spirits.\u201d While Hakau was speaking, Pupualenalena heard and understood the king\u2019s wish. That night the shell was again blown by the spirits. At midnight the king of the spirits retired leaving the guards to keep watch; but later on they also fell asleep. Pupualenalena then stole in and jumped over the sleeping guards. Seeing the shell hanging over the king, it jumped over him, took the shell, stuck his head in through the loop of the string by which it was hung up and ran off with it. While in its flight and just as he was out of the house one side of the shell struck a rock and a piece of the shell was broken off. Upon hearing the crack of the shell the spirits woke up and gave chase, but they were unable to catch the dog. When the dog arrived in the presence of Hakau with the shell, he was so happy that he thereupon placed the master and his dog on a piece of land near by, and they became great favorites with Hakau.

On the next day he left Molokai and set sail for Oahu, landing at Hanauma where he left his canoe and proceeded overland; he first stopped at Kaimuki, then at Niuhelewai, where he took a bath, then continued on his way till he came to Pokai, in Waianae, where he spent the night. When he woke up the next morning he saw the canoes of Pueonuiokona, from Kauai, preparing for their return, so he proceeded to the landing place and asked of the men that he be allowed to accompany them to Kauai. At this request the men said: \u201cBe off, you shameless youngster , you shall not take passage in the king\u2019s canoes.\u201d When the king heard his men talking he called out: \u201cYoung man, come here to me.\u201d When the boy stood in the presence of the king, the king asked him: \u201cWhat [ ] were you saying to the men?\u201d \u201c I was asking them that I be allowed passage on the canoes to Kauai; but they told me that the canoes belonged to the king.\u201d Pueonuiokona then said: \u201cYou may take passage in one of them. Have you any baggage to take along?\u201d The boy answered: \u201cNo, except that I have a calabash of clothes. \u201d \u201cWell, get it and come here and we will sail.\u201d"}]}

In the first four months of the voyage their food, meat and water, were exhausted and the men began to die of hunger and thirst, and the brothers were in great distress. When the brothers found that all their food was exhausted, they went down into the body of the ship and stayed there, while Aukelenuiaiku and the boy stayed above. After several days had gone by, the boy began to wonder at the disappearance of his father and uncles, so he went down into the ship to look for them. When he got to the bottom of the vessel he found his father and uncles lying weak from hunger. The boy then climbed onto the breast of his father, Kekamakahinuiaiku, the one with the violent temper, and who hated Aukelenuiaiku most of all. As the boy sat on his father\u2019s chest, the father looked up and when he saw his son he said: \u201cYes, how pitiful! I have no regrets as far as we are concerned, for we have spent many days in this world; but it is you that I pity, for all the food, the meat and water are gone, and all that is left is two joints of sugar-cane.\u201d The boy replied: \u201cI am not distressed, for I am not in need of food, for my uncle has a certain leaf which we touch to our lips and our hunger is satisfied, and we stay without wanting any food for four months.\u201d After talking with his father for a while, he returned to his uncle, Aukelenuiaiku, [ ] with tears in his eyes.

I am hated by your father as his most bitter enemy, but according to our birth by our parents, I will not act as they have toward me. Therefore, my boy, here is the food, the meat, and the water in this club of ours (the name of this club was Kaiwakaapu); take it and open one end of the club, and the food, the meat, the kapa and everything else will come out of their own accord.\u201d The boy then followed the direction of his uncle, Aukelenuiaiku, and all the things necessary for their comfort were furnished them.

When the queen saw that her favorite dog was killed, she regretted his death so much that she bowed her head in grief and wept. After the death of her dog, she ordered her four brothers, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana, and commanded them: \u201cUse your power and kill this fellow.

If she should ask you to sleep with her, don\u2019t give your consent, for you will get killed; but you sit on her breast and give a sigh, and when she asks of you why you sighed, tell her that you are hungry for something to eat; and if she should order you to come and get something to eat, obey her, for your wife is a goddess and not a human being.\u201d These admonitions were satisfactory to Aukelenuiaiku. In all these things we know that Aukelenuiaiku after all received some good in return for the offerings he pretended to have made to the gods, for in the end he won Namakaokahai and she became his wife.

On coming out of her house, her beauty overshadowed the rays of the sun, so that darkness covered the land, and the red rain would be seen approaching; the fog would also come, and after these things had been seen the fine rain would come, then the red waters would flow and the lightning would play in the heavens. After these things, then the form of Malanaikuaheahea would be seen coming along over the tips [ ] of the fingers of her servants, in all her beauty. Makalii thought a good deal of his wife and he made much of her. The sun was eclipsed by her, and the rainbow was her footstool. When Aukelenuiaiku saw these different things and then the wife of Makalii, he grew faint and dizzy, and could hardly control himself, so he made up his mind to come back to earth."}]}

She then spoke in parables saying: \u201cYes, there are two kinds of fish in the sea that bite: the shark and the eel.\u201d Then she continued: \u201cStrange, that your skin is all bitten and your neck scratched, but you don\u2019t return with any sharks and eels.\u201d Aukelenuiaiku then said with great cunning: \u201cI met with a queer experience today. When I arrived at the seashore I tied the bait to my hook and cast it into the sea. After I had let the line down it got caught in the coral down below, and so I dived down and after getting the line loose I came up. I was not at all hurt at this time. But on casting my line the second time it again got tangled and I dived the second time. After this it was caught the third time and again I went down, but before I had gone very far I got the cramps and I was carried by the current away down to the bottom where I was rubbed against the coral until my back was all cut up. After this I recovered myself and swam up, and this time I was caught in an eel hole, and there I was rolled about by the surf until I was almost out of breath. Had I been a boy from the backwoods I would have been killed, and you would not have known how, and how pitiful that would have been.\u201d"}]}

Because of this the cousins rose and departed to some other place to dwell; but Namakaokahai followed them and again drove them away. The cousins in the meantime thought that she would forget the cause of her anger, but she followed after them and drove them away from their new home. At this persistency on their cousin\u2019s part, they vowed that they would never again turn back, nor ever again live in the same land with their cousin.

In this journey, when they reached Kauai, where they made their home, they had an idea that their cousin would leave them in peace and not follow them up. The place where Pele and Hiiaka took up as their first home on Kauai was at Puukapele, a place to the east of Mana.

After everything pertaining to the voyage was ready, the paddlers, the bailers, immediate attendants, uncles and Kakakauhanui boarded the canoe together with Kila, who sat in the covered platform, and they set sail for Tahiti. Before Kila boarded the canoe, however, Moikeha addressed him saying: \u201cYou are on your way. Don\u2019t fail to recognize your uncle Makalii, or you will kill him.\u201d After all the islands had disappeared and all that could be seen was the top of Maunakea, they were met by Keaumiki and Keauka, two [ ] monster demigods of the deep, who drew their canoe down to the coral beds of the sea: so Kakakauhanui dove down to the bottom and stayed there for ten and two nights before coming up again. Keaumiki and Keauka were only able to stay down ten nights. This feat of endurance saved the canoe. The voyage was then resumed. When they were approaching near to Tahiti they first touched at a small island where the aunt of Moikeha was living, a supernatural rat, Kanepohihi by name. Her eyes were covered over with wrinkles and she was blind. When Kila came upon her she was cooking bananas in the ashes. When he saw Kanepohihi cooking bananas, he reached down, took the bananas and placed them on to one side of the cooking place. When Kanepohihi reached for the bananas she was unable to find them, so she said to herself: \u201cThere must be a demi-god about.\u201d At this Kila addressed her saying: \u201cMy greetings to you, Kanepohihi.\u201d"}]}

Even the ants were heard to sing in his praise; the birds sang, the pebbles rumbled, the shells cried out, the grass withered, the smoke hung low, the rainbow appeared, the thunder was heard, the dead came to life, the hairless dogs were seen and countless spirits of all kinds were seen.

When Pokai was enceinte of Namakaokapaoo, Kauluakahai went back to his own land, leaving Pokai in that condition until childbirth. When the child was born Pokai and her child Namakaokapaoo were quite destitute, and while they were in that condition of life a good man named Pualii came from Lihue to fish at Honouliuli. He turned in at the home of Pokai. He looked at her and had a yearning for her.

(Kula-o-Keahumoa.) They lived there tilling the soil. Pualii had two large potato patches which remain to this day; they are called Namakaokapaoo. When the potatoes were ripe Pualii made a vow that when the head of an ulua fish and the potatoes were roasted, and Pualii had first eaten thereof, then the potatoes would be free, and that his wife and others could eat thereof. Therefore Pualii went down to Honouliuli to catch the fish to be eaten together with the potato."}]}

But if you are afraid, then go and hide your faces in the sky; and if you should hear that Ihuanu is victorious, remember it was by the blow known as Kanikapihe, the blow the teacher has not instructed you of, for I see he will not be able to overcome me, for I hear the end of my loin cloth snap behind me.\u201d His companions then said to him: \u201cWe have nothing more to say to you, we have done our part.

After they had fought for some time, they moved to Waikiki where the fighting was renewed. Here the Hawaii men tried to mob Pihana, but were unsuccessful. The fighting kept moving thence to Kulaokahua, then to Puowaina, behind which a man of the Oahu warriors was secretly shot by a foreigner\u2019s gun. From that place they moved on to Pauoa, and passing this place came to Kaheiki, a place adjacent to Maemae. Here the Hawaii forces came to a stand. [ ]"}]}

It was during the battles of Kana with the chief of Haupu; the latter had taken his mother, and Kana wanted her released to return to her husband; the husband had felt very badly because his mate, the wife, was separated from him; he had cast about for a way of getting her back, but found none. So the father thought that Kana could bring her back, because he had numerous bodies, and he was born in a queer way. But when Kana went to get the mother, the hill started to grow upwards and nearly touched the heaven. This was the reason for it: there were two turtles under the mountain; so when Kana went over for his mother, the people on the mountain called to the turtle in this manner: \u201cO Kahakauwila, lift up the hill;\u201d then the mountain would rise until Kana became a dwarf alongside of it. This was continued until Kana was hungry, because his food had given out, so he laid down towards Uli, his grandmother, who was residing on Hawaii. She nourished him until he grew large. When his younger brother saw that Kana\u2019s feet were plump he said to himself, \u201cStrange! here you have enough to eat and I live in hunger; I shall cut off your feet.\u201d So he cut off Kana\u2019s feet. Kana said to his grandmother: \u201cMy feet are getting cold.\u201d The grandmother replied: \u201cYes, your younger brother noticed that your feet were fat; he became peeved; and that was why he chopped them off.\u201d"}]}

There were two potato fields, one for Kupihe and the other for Kapanaia. Kupihe planted his potato on the side hill while Kapanaia planted his on the flat. When they were cultivating, only one potato was found in Kapanaia\u2019s field, so he hilled it up. But the potato grew large and became exposed from the hill in which it was planted; the field of the other man, however, did not contain any potato. Afterwards they went to their homes, and on the next day they went up again to cultivate. Kapanaia hastened to see [his potato], but when he looked there was no lump in the hill; he searched but could not find the potato. He looked here and there, but he could not find it. So he went up to Kupihe\u2019s, the field on the hillside. When he looked, he saw this potato causing a lump in the other\u2019s potato hill, and Kupihe was hilling up the soil. Kapanaia stood there and asked, \u201cWhose potato is this?\u201d The other answered: \u201cIt is mine, for it is growing in my potato-hill.\u201d After their quarrel over the potato they returned to their homes. That night the potato rolled down the hill and made a deep hole where it first struck; from there it bounced and became again attached to its parent vine. That is one version of the story. But in the story which I heard, it is stated that the stem of this potato was bitten by a rat and the potato rolled down until it landed in Kapanaia\u2019s field, and it was left there until new sprouts commenced to grow from it. That is why new sprouts come from potatoes as we see them now. That was why this potato at Makiki was called Ualakaa, because it rolled [down hill]. Another name which I heard [applied to it] was Iolekaa (rolling rat). Another has it that Kaauhelemoa pecked at the stem of this potato and it rolled to Kapanaia\u2019s field, because Pupuulima chased after it."}]}

Eeke took the child to his mother, Maunahoomaha, and left him with her. After that their god, Hinaikauluau, placed a restriction over them; they were not to live together, nor were they to have any intercourse with others; but ten days after this order, Eeke again committed adultery with Puuwaiohina above referred to, who was a younger sister to Lihau. Because of this their god punished them by making Eeke a mountain and Puuwaiohina a mountain ridge; that is the ridge prominent at Kauaula.

Maui took to wife Hina and begat Mauimua, Mauihope, Mauikiikii and Mauiokalana; they were all boys. The occupation of these boys was fishing. This was their practice in fishing while living at Kaupo, Maui: Mauiokalana wished to go fishing; he said to his elder brothers: \u201cSay, this is a calm day; shouldn\u2019t we sail the sea? for this is a good day, the sea is calm; this is a day when the tide is not strong in its opposition for it is flowing in one direction.\u201d When he had finished speaking, Mauimua answered: \u201cLet us not sail, for this will be a tempestuous day; this calmness which we see is only in the morning; when the sun rises you will see the waves rise, the wind will increase, and in a short time we will be obliged to return. Put off your fishing until a calm day.\u201d Then Mauiokalana spoke again: \u201cWhy, I thought because you are the first-born you knew the signs of the sky, but I see you do not! Your yellow teeth signify nothing.\u201d Then Mauimua, displeased, answered: \u201cSay, my younger [ ] brother, you do not realize that I am the one acquainted with the ways of this place. This is the sign I know about: when you sleep until near morning, and should hear the breaking surf above the wind, then it will be calm. That is my sign, that you may hear, my younger brother. But what of it? let us sail according to your urging.\u201d Mauimua ordered the canoes lifted to the beach. The canoes were taken to the shore, and they prepared to sail for fishing. When they arrived at the reef they saw a fire burning on land. Then Mauiokalana said to his elder brothers: \u201cSay, there is a fire burning; whose fire can this be?\u201d The others replied: \u201cWhose indeed? Perhaps we had better return so we can cook some food for us.\u201d \u201cPshaw! Let us first go and get some fish, then return; so that when we get back with fish we can broil them, cook the food, and then [we can] sleep well, being satisfied.\u201d They went on; in no time they had caught some fish. They then returned. As soon as they arrived at the beach Mauimua left the canoe, and ran to where the fire was seen burning. Kaalaehuapi saw him so he and the others threw dirt on the fire and smothered it, and flew away. Mauimua was disappointed; he returned to their house. The others asked, \u201cHow about the fire?\u201d \u201cThere is no fire; it is put out; I thought it was man, but it was not; some mudhens kindled the fire. Our bananas are being stolen.\u201d Because they saw that their bananas were being stolen they did not go fishing; they hoped the fire would be kindled again, but it was not lighted. Then they went fishing again. Whenever they went out fishing the fire would burn. Thus were they harassed, but they could not get anything, because Kaalaehuapi knew that Maui and Hina had four sons. When they went fishing Kaalaehuapi counted them; when they were all present it would light the fire."}]}

Kaaiai\u2019s property consisted of three narrow strips of land, six sets of scented kapa, eight dogs, fifty hogs, four houses; those were what the man\u2019s property consisted of. When they tried, Kamauoha inflicted the first pain; all the man\u2019s property was completely taken over by the opponent, and he returned empty handed to his house. His wife asked, \u201cAnd how was your journey?\u201d \u201cYou ask how, indeed! The properties which we accumulated thinking that they would be added to were taken from me, and I returned stripped; the other\u2019s strength was known and yet I dared provoke him, hoping to benefit thereby.\u201d"}]}

The burial is done at night, however, not in the day time. In digging the grave, it is dug round like a banana hole. The usual depth of the grave is up to one\u2019s waist, that is, up to the loin of a man. In the olden time, this grave was called a pahee (smooth place). Upon digging, take the dirt from the grave to another place in a fine mat, or a gourd, else the tracks would be shown. Should it be a new house, the friends of the dead would dig from the outside till they reached within, without the house owner knowing anything about it. The people thought that if the burial place was known, the bones would be taken for fish hooks, and the flesh for shark bait. There are some hidden graves among the precipices; others are on plains. There is a hidden grave at Haleakala; it is called the grave of Kaawa; it is right mauka of Nuu, on Maui. This is the way the corpse is treated before being thrown into [ ] that hole. When the friend of the dead takes the corpse, he takes also what the deceased was fond of when living: If he was fond of pork, banana, or perhaps sugar-cane, etc., he takes them; and upon arriving at the grave, the friend of the deceased calls to the departed ancestors first buried in that grave, thus: \u201cSo and so, here comes your descendant.\u201d If the corpse should keep falling until it drops into the water, and a rainbow appears, then it is without relatives; but the corpse who has relatives is grasped by them when the body is thrown, and is stranded on the precipice, and not dropped into the water. After the burial [they] come home and mourn. Another thing: If the corpse is being carried, and the one he loved is far in the rear, no progress would be made, for the deceased would demur. The one he loved should be immediately behind, then there would be no demurring. This is what the friend of the dead should say: \u201cI thought you loved me, but you do not; if you act like this, your bones will be broken.\u201d When he has finished saying that, the corpse will acquiesce, and it will be light work carrying it to the place of burial. The grave should be well lined, and the corpse laid to rest, the head towards the east, the feet towards the west. It is wrong to lay the corpse with the head towards the west, for it would appear as a ghost. When the body is buried, the friend should repeat these words: \u201cDo not go wandering to houses, but stay quietly here; you have food, fish and clothes.\u201d"}]}

They did this until everything was gathered by those on the canoe, the plants and the leaves and put them in the canoes. Afterwards the shore people brought a tall tree which they stood in the sand, its trunk and its leaves. That plant in Hawaii nei is called Halapepe . When Apua saw this he instructed his men to erect on a canoe a large plant with branches resembling the coconut. They told the shore people that it was a coconut; that it had grown and sprouted, leaved and had borne fruit in Hawaii. Because they said this the halapepe was thrown into the sea, and they got it and put it into the canoes. The canoes were loaded with eatables, trunks and leaves when they landed in Hawaii nei."}]}

After that a widow had an idea to go and search for food for them. She said to the parents of her husband: \u201cI am going to search for some mountain kalo for food for us; do you prepare the wood. You wait for me, and if the day passes by without my return, then you may conclude that I am dead.\u201d She then started off to look for wild kalo. She followed the course of a stream. While going towards the mountain not a kalo could she find. It was already picked by those who had gone [ ] before. She kept on until she came to the tall woods when she found some mountain kalo. Others who had sought for food had not gone as far as this. She gathered enough for a large pile which she bundled conveniently for carrying. Then she kept going mountainwards, following the stream. She saw cane stretching out on the ground and then rising again, and bananas till they were over-ripe. She hastened to break some cane and to get some bananas, thinking to take home a bundle of sugar-cane. Kahuoi heard the cane snapping and the noise of the banana trees as they were thrown down.

The akaakai (rush) mat is braided like the lauhala. It is cold when you first lie on it; it takes some time to warm it up. The alolua mat: in the braiding of this two lauhala strands are placed back to back and are braided in that way. Any kind of lauhala would do for this, old lauhala or young lauhala. The puahala mat has a foundation like the flower of the hala (pandanus) when cut; it has serrated edges. Any kind of lauhala will do. I know nothing about the makanui mat. The pakea mat: I am a little doubtful about this mat, but this is the explanation offered by some: the pakea mat is a mat made of the midrib of the lauhala; after the leafy parts are separated from it, this part is taken and braided into a mat. Some say that it is a makoloa mat, and is the whitest mat, not a spot either red or black or other color could be seen on it. The pueo mat is a mat which has large braids. I have not seen that mat. I have not seen the launui mat, either, nor the hiialo mat. It is said that the kumukolu has three layers at the starting point, and the kumulua has two; but I do not know what is meant by that. The palau is an old and worn mat, generally small, used for sitting by fireplaces, and used on the veranda outside or inside the doorway. The palau and the aneenee are the same thing.

In commencing, first thatch on two battens, then another two, and so keep agoing until sufficient have been started. In piercing string holes they must alternate, and not run in one line, lest the house leak. It is well to alternate the placing of cords, so that they would appear irregular. In preparing the lauhala, however, the thorny edges are stripped before thatching, or else it is wet with water. When the thatching is completed except near the top, two other battens are prepared and placed on either side of the ridge; these battens are called the aho kopekope and we-o . When these have been covered with thatching, again place two other battens, one on each side; and in the middle, another [ ] batten called the aho lolo , that is the one next to the supplementary ridge; these battens thatched thus are called kauhuhu ."}]}

But if a planter waits until the month of Ikiiki, of misty rain, that is when the rain is light and is easily scattered by the wind, on the day of Mohalu in the month of Ikiiki, [that] is the month for him to plant in the manner described above. These are the names of the potatoes to be planted: waipalupalu , kokoakeawe , kuapai , heauau and haole . He waits until the months of Kaaona and Hinaiaeleele are past when he goes again to look, and he finds that some are dead and some are growing. This is what he says: \u201cMy wife and children are saved by the baldheaded one.\u201d He waits for some time longer until the grass grows, then he weeds it; this [weeding] is sufficient until the time that the potato is ripe. After weeding, leave it for many days; when the planter comes again and hills up the soil. If any potato is found while hilling up the dirt, that is, the fruit in between the plants growing on the vine, he breaks off the first potato. He returns, lights a fire in the imu, cooks the potato until done, and brings it to the house. He sits beside the doorway and prays thus: \u201cYe large black cloud hanging below the eye of the narrow pointed clouds, give shade, protecting shade; guard this our garden, O Keaonui; do thou cast shade over this our garden, O Keaonui; shade thou from that corner to this corner; shade thou from that side to this side; shade not another\u2019s garden lest you be scolded for shutting out the sun and chilling the owner of that garden. O Keaonui, shade thou this our field; shade thou the hills, shade thou the leaves of our food, so that the plants would grow and the [ ] hills be filled with potatoes. O ye Keaonui, shade our garden from the head to the bottom, from the upper to the lower side; hallowed is the prayer; it is free.\u201d"}]}

The first duty of the farmer to perform was to clear the weeds; when that is done, then the banks must be made solid to prevent leakage. When a taro patch is dried, then the farmer digs the patch in blocks ( eka ) and turns it over, places the blocks against or along the banks, and the remaining dirt, or earth for the patch; because if stones only were placed along the banks the water would all flow through it. Therefore, the earth will help it. After the patch is all dug and in good order, nothing lacking, then the farmer waits a few days, allowing time to soften the earth; when he knows that the time for planting is at hand, he procures the bundle of taro tops and carries them to the patch.

The first thing they did was to remove the akolea fern till it was well cleared, after which the taro tops were planted and the fern leaves were then spread all over the planted field, that the dampness may be retained and the whole field be kept moist. Weeds will not make their appearance until the taro is almost matured; at the same time adhere to the practice of the old people in constantly loosening the soil, and when you see the taro at maturity it is extra large, exceeding in size that planted on the open plain. A number of residents of my locality moved to the ohia grove to take up taro culture at that time, and the crops were large. This concludes my observations of my grandparents\u2019 practice concerning their method of taro cultivation. In conclusion, concerning the planting of taro in wet-land and things relating to its method. Respecting this subject, in my opinion it is needless for me to reiterate my remarks concerning the present method of preparing the patch, also of planting, for the reason that each and everyone of us are familiar with our every day duties, and it is unnecessary for me to relate it at this time, for the old-time method is that being observed and practiced by us, such as the loosening of the taro tops, pressing them down in the soil, and things relating thereto. Therefore, it is clear to us that though the recount shows a difference in the methods of culture it agrees in its divisions. This is the result of what I have gathered upon the subject assigned for my investigation. January 25, 1872. Samuel K. Kainoa. [ ]"}]}

(It is said that this war club, Kahehumakua, was a very large one, for it was nothing else but a tree with its branches and leaves still on; and when carried by Kauahoa, the birds would perch and sing in it.) When Kawelo saw Kauahoa coming down the hill and saw how large he was, casting a large shadow because of his great height, he began to have some fear of his chances. When Kauahoa arrived in the presence of Kawelo, Kawelo picked up his club and took his stand by the side of Kanewahineikiaoha, his wife, to the right of Kauahoa; his brother stood to the left of Kauahoa, and his adopted sons stood behind. As Kawelo stood up with his war club, which was ten fathoms in length, the club with one end on the ground only could reach to the middle of Kauahoa, showing that Kauahoa was about twenty fathoms in height. In standing thus, Kawelo was almost overcome with fear of Kauahoa, for Kawelo was only educated in two ways of fighting with the war club; the stroke from the ground upwards and the one from above downwards. He was not taught in the side strokes. Therefore, Kawelo began to study how to overcome his opponent, but for a time he was undecided what to do, which made him very uncertain of the outcome. This studying took him some time and gradually his fears began to vanish, as he decided to fight until death ended the battle."}]}

When Aikanaka saw Kaeleha, he called him in and set food and meat before him and Kawelowai, his daughter. After partaking of Aikanaka\u2019s hospitality, Kaeleha was ashamed, because he had nothing to repay Aikanaka for his kindness.

A hook with a stone attached forming the bait are the things that catch it. When fishing, chew the kukui [nuts] and blow it on the sea to calm it whereby the bottom is made clear, and when the squid is located the hook is let down. There are several varieties of this fish (the squid), and it has a body which it can transform in various ways; that is why the kukui is blown over the sea, to calm it and [permit] the squid [to be] plainly seen. Here are the different forms of the squid at different times: In the morning the form resembles that of breadfruit, that is, the skin. Toward noon it is red. In the afternoon it is brown, similar to seaweed. In the evening it is dark like the coral. All squid, both large and small, change in the same way. Therefore those who are not learned in discerning the squid are not fit to go out on this kind of fishing."}]}

Thereafter that man thrust his hands And turned his mantle the other side out, Wherefore Moi dreaded this man Lest he should push the mountain down. Then Moi awoke with a shiver 15. And said unto the chief, chanting forth: Heedest thou the prediction? [ ] Who is the chief deaf at the hidden language, In the dream of me, the priest, in the day time? The land flees, the frames are thrown into confusion. 20. Yield my younger brother, for the drums stand in line, The fences are being overleaped, the unus are being given to destruction; The moi is being lifted to the altar whereon is the banana of Palila. The sun has risen above the mountain; It rose, with eyes like the moon in brightness. 25. In his view he fled, As if the eyes belonged to the aloa. The earth was lightened [by his eyes], The fowls quarreled in the night. The great moving body that conquered through reinforcement. 30. It\u2019s being so the land was heated.

[ ] The voice of man is forbidden; Here is the soul within Kulu-wai-maka-lani; The soul within the smooth bones of the god. 15. Here are the sacred signs of the assembly: The voice of thunder bursts forth; Flashing are the rays of the lightning; The earthquake shakes the earth; The smoky cloud and the rainbow appeareth; 20. The heavy rain and high wind prevails; The whirlwinds sweep beneath the earth; Rocks adjoining the streams are moved; The red mountain-streams rush to the sea. Here are the waterspouts; 25. Tumbled about are the cluster clouds of heaven; Gushing forth are the springs in the cliffs. One eye has the god; Two, four eyes, to see clearly behind him. Greatly revered be the voice of my god in the heavens. 30. It has been inspired within Papa-iakea, Dwelling within the Maka-kolu-kolu-kahi. The kapu of Lono reaches to Kahiki, It goes to overthrow the kapu of Kahai, Sacrificing the kapu of Kahai on the altar; 35. It has fallen and tumbled in confusion. Dead are the fish, fallen in their flight; Fallen disfigured all through Kahiki; Kahai is stirring up the pelting rain; Kahai is beating the surface of the earth. 40.

The sun and moon wept, The heaven was veiled in darkness, The clouds wept for Jesus, The darkness fell down at his feet. Jehovah divided the waters of heaven, 40. The Messiah returned in his glorious chariot, Saying unto his disciples: I am going to heaven, To the bosom of my Father, And will send you a teacher. 45. Jesus departed with the power of the Spirit. His fame went all abroad, Jesus was the soldier of Kawaluna. The land trembled with fear of the multitude; Together they fled in dismay 50. At the revelation of the great day of Jesus. Compassionate art thou, O Jesus, Who died to save us. Ours was the guilt for which the Lord died. By his death 55. Once only was that sacrifice for sin.

Love to you Lahainaluna, The chief parent of the Hawaiian Isles, The beautiful golden garment of the poor; The glory of the orphans. You are the one greatly thought of 5. By the new students from Hawaii to Kauai. We are happy over your everlasting beauty; Our minds are ever longing Just to see your honored home, And your beautiful golden fence. 10. O Lahainaluna, love to you, Where wise men have dwelt, There were our hearts made ever glad With the shady trees of your grounds Where your brethren encamp around thee. 15. O Lahainaluna, love to you, The shelter of the learned. You have found a new chief For the residents. From you have come forth 20. The honored men of the Hawaiian government; From your bosom there were sent out Deacons and disciples of the Lord. O Lahainaluna, I love you Who brought out the goodness of the Hawaiian Kingdom. 25. Where shall I find the one you long to see? Let us consider the learned men From Hawaii to Kauai. Is it right to have the flag half-masted By the Hawaiian Kingdom? 30. The sumach flowers turn toward the plain of Puopelu Resting safely with the breeze, the aa, Here we are the orphans, longing to be with thee. O Lahainaluna, I love thee, The breast of the orphans. 35. [ ] You are the kawelu (grass) at the cliff of Nuuanu; At Nuuanu, the dividing line of knowledge, Seeking for you but never finding you. There you are at the Isthmus of Darien, Overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. 40. O Lahainaluna, I love you. You are the sounding twine of the shoemaker; You are the sledge hammer of the blacksmith; You are the compass of the navigators; And the mud-hen singing at mid-night. 45. I heard a noise while asleep and awoke, O Lahainaluna, I love you. You were a hunch-back among the chiefs; You were the consulting companion of the two winds, The moae and the hauapepee . 50. They are the originators of the kona, To hide away your love Across to the stormy sea of Cape Horn. O Lahainaluna, I love you; Thou art the misty rain of Lilikoi 55. That is agitating my heart. You have seen Waialeale, You were delighted with the water of Haunu, Lovely Kaala sublime in its beauty, It was the beauty of the land, 60. You are the fragrant flower of Ainahau, that is kissed in all lands. In the midst of people, and the jungle of Africa. I love the lehua blooming on the plain, Satisfied in the sojourn that was blessed by the red rain, Murmuring at Kanehoa. 65. You was a friend in time of trouble at Lahainaluna, Just like the pervading of perfumes Flying over to the calm of Lele. I jumped to embrace you, but could not find you You were at Ieheulani. 70. Beautiful lies the field of Kaiwiula. O Lahainaluna, I love you, The greatest in the Kingdom of Hawaii nei. March 30, 1853. [ ]"}]}
