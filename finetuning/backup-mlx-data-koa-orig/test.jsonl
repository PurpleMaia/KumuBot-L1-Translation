After the box was built she put the god into it, who was Lonoikoualii, and said to Aukelenuiaiku: “With this god you will conquer and become possessed of the land that I have just described. Here is your food and meat; it is a laukahi. This leaf is wholesome; as soon as you touch it to your lips your hunger is satisfied; and when satisfied you can go without eating for a period of four months.” The grandmother then took up an axe and a knife and put them into the box. The lizard next cut off its tail and gave it to the grandson, saying: “This is my real body, which you must take with you. Here are also my pau of feathers and my feather kahili which shall act as your preserver when you meet your cousin. With these things in your possession—that is, by wearing the pau and holding this kahili you will cause your enemies to fall and turn into ashes.” The lizard then explained the uses of all the different things to her grandson, and she also taught him how to preserve these things of magic; but she did not tell him the name of the cousin. She was Namakaokahai."}]}

When the brother who entertained some love for Aukelenuiaiku saw their oldest brother coming back, he asked: “Where is our brother?” The oldest brother replied: “I have not seen him, and he was not at the place where I went to.” After this the brother who wished to save Aukelenuiaiku got up and went out in search of him. In this search he went to their home, where he learned that Aukelenuiaiku had not returned. He then took up the loin cloth of his brother, and wore it round his neck and wept. While he was weeping their father Iku heard it, and so he inquired: “Who is this weeping?” “I, Ikumailani.” “What are you weeping for?” “I am weeping for Aukelenuiaiku; he is dead.” When their father heard this he also wept."}]}
