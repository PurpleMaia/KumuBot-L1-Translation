"A loaa o Aukelenuiaiku, hoi mai la laua a hiki i ka hale kahi o ko laua makuakane e noho ana, lele mai la ko laua makuakane uwe, a me na mea a pau loa. O ka nui o na la o keia kaawale ana ewalu la. Mamua ae o ka loaa ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua paa ka moku o na kaikuaana i ke kapili, a ua makaukau e holo, ua lana i loko o ke kai. Ma keia ola hou ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua lohe ua kaikuaana huhu lokoino nei, ua hoi mai o Aukelenuiaiku, a nona keia makena e uwe ia mai nei. Nolaila, kena ae la ia e hoomakaukau ka holo, e kahu ke o, a e ee i luna o ka moku.","After Aukelenuiaiku was found he was brought home to their father who fell on his son and wept for joy, as did all the others, for he had been lost for about eight days. Before Aukelenuiaiku was found, the ship of the brothers was completed and preparations were made for departure, as it had been launched. When the oldest brother saw that Aukelenuiaiku was again back safe and well, and that the wailing that he had heard was because of the return of Aukelenuiaiku, he immediately gave orders that the final preparations be completed; that the food be cooked, and after that everybody was to go aboard."
"Mahope iho o ko Moikeha make ana, laweia aku la kona kupapau ma ka pali o Haena, a hiki i ka manawa a Kila i hoihoi ai i Tahiti. Ia manawa mahope iho, noho iho la o Kila ma ko Moikeha noho ana, e like me ka makemake o kona makuakane, a me kona mau makuahine, a me ka makuakane o na makuahine.","After the death of Moikeha, his dead body was taken to the cliffs of Haena where it was deposited until a convenient time for Kila to remove it to Tahiti. Soon after this Kila began to assume the reins of government and ruled in place of Moikeha, according to the wish of his late father, his mother and aunt, and his mother’s father."
"A lohe na makuahine o lakou i keia olelo, kanikau hele aku la o Hooipoikamalanai, e hoonaauaua ana ia laua iho me Hinauu. I aku la o Hooipoikamalanai ma i ka laua mau keiki: “Auhea la hoi na iwi o ko oukou makuakane?” I mai la kana mau keiki: “Ua lilo i ka moana, ia kahuli ana no o makou, lilo makou ia Kila kahi i aumeume ai, aole o makou manao ae i kela.” A mahope iho o keia manawa, kanikau hele aku la o Hinauu ma i ke aloha o Kila a puni o Kauai, a huipu aku la me na makaainana i ke kanikau.","When the mothers heard this account of the death of Kila, Hoopoikamalanai and her sister Hinauu wailed and expressed a desire to take their own lives, their grief for their son was so great. Hooipoikamalanai and her sister then inquired of their sons: “Where, then, are the bones of your father?” The sons replied: “We lost them in the ocean. When our canoe was overturned we all went to the rescue of Kila, and therefore the bones of our father were neglected and they disappeared.” After this Hinauu and her sister traveled around Kauai mourning for Kila, in which the common people also joined with them."
"A hala aku la na kaikuaana o Kila, noho iho la o Kila ia koena po, e noonoo ana i ka hana a kona mau kaikuaana. A kokoke i ka wanaao, a no ka loihi o kona ala ana ia po, nolaila, ua pauhiaia oia e ka hiamoe nui. A ia ia e hiamoe ana, ua hiki ae ka la, a mehana iki ae, ike ia mai la ua o Kila e hiamoe ana i kaha one. Hele mai na kamaaina a ike i keia keiki maikai e moe ana, ua pauhia i ka hiamoe. A nolaila, hoala ia ae la, me ka ninau iho o na kamaaina, i kona wahi i hele mai ai a me ke ano o kona hiki ana malaila. Alaila, hai aku la oia i ka moolelo e like me ka hana a kona mau kaikuaana. A no ia mea, hoihoi ia aku la e na kamaaina ma kauhale kamaaina.","After the brothers had gone, Kila remained the rest of the night in meditation, trying to comprehend the object of his brothers’ actions. Toward morning he fell into a deep sleep after sitting up most of the night. While he was asleep and the sun was rising higher and higher, he was seen by the people, who came to admire this handsome young man who was fast asleep on the sand. At last the people woke him up and asked him where he had come from and the circumstances of his arrival at this place. He then told them the whole history of his treatment by his brothers. He was then taken to the home of one of the men."
"Aka, lohe ae la na kaikuaana o Kila, aia ka ai ma Waipio, manao ae la ko lakou kupunakane, a me ko lakou makuahine e holo i ai i Waipio; aka, aole nae e hiki ia lakou ke ae e hele, no ka mea, ua hana hewa aku lakou ia Kila malaila, oia no ko lakou mea i kanalua ai, o hele auanei lakou, o ike mai o Kila ia lakou, nolaila pono ole. Aka no ka paipai nui o ko lakou makuahine i na keiki e holo, hoole loa aku na keiki. A no ka paakiki loa o na keiki ma ko lakou manao, nolaila, ninau pakahi aku la ko lakou mau makuahine i ka laua mau keiki, no ka makemake e holo i ai i Waipio. Aka ua hoole na mea a pau o na keiki ana; a ma kekahi manawa mahope mai, ninau pinepine aku no i na keiki; ekolu keiki i hoole, a hookahi mea i ae e hele i ka ai i Waipio, o Kaialea.","When Kila’s brothers heard that there was food at Waipio, their grandfather and mothers made up their minds to send the boys to Waipio for food; but none of the boys were willing to go, because it was at this place that they had abandoned Kila to his fate; so they were very reluctant about going, for fear that he might see them and there would be trouble. As often as their mothers urged them to go they as often refused, and finally they told their mothers that on no condition would they think of going. Upon meeting this persistent refusal on the part of their sons, the mothers determined to ask them one by one, to see if there was not a chance to persuade one of them to go, but every one of them refused. The mothers would not have no for an answer, and kept on urging the sons till finally one of the boys, Kaialea, consented to go to Waipio to get them some food."
"A o ko Kauai poe hoi, ua kali ia mai la o Kaialea, aole he hoi aku, nolaila, hoouna ia kekahi mau kanaka e Hooipoikamalanai ma e huli ia Kaialea. Ia huli ia ana a hiki i Hawaii ma Waipio. Ia manawa a lakou i hiki aku ai, ninau ia mai la lakou nei, ko Kauai poe, i ke kumu o ko lakou hiki ana i laila. Aka hai aku la lakou, “he huakai imi alii, e imi ana ia Kaialea.” A no kea mea, hai aku la na kamaaina: “Ua make o Kaialea, aia maloko o ka heiau, ua oleloia nae e kau ana i ka lele, aka, aole nae i ikeia ke kau ana i ka lele, ua make malu paha, ua kiola ia paha maloko o ka lua pau.”","In the meantime the people on Kauai awaited Kaialea’s return. But after a long wait without hearing anything of him, Hooipoikamalanai and her sister sent a party of men to come and institute a search for him. On this voyage, the party arrived at Waipio, Hawaii. Upon their arrival they were asked why they had come, so they replied that they were in search of a chief, Kaialea by name. On learning the mission of the strangers, the Waipio people informed them that he had been condemned to be put to death. They further told the strangers that Kaialea was now in confinement in the temple, and it had been reported that he was to be sacrificed, but so far no one had seen him sacrificed, but it was possible that he had been put to death secretly. On the other hand he might have been thrown in a deep pit."
"A o na kanaka hoi i hoi malu ai i ka po, na hoewaa i holo pu mai me Kaialea, a me kekahi kanaka i hoouna hopeia mai e Hooipoikamalanai, hoi aku la lakou a hiki i Kauai; ninau mai la o Hooipoikamalanai: “Auhea hoi ko oukou nui?” I aku la lakou: “I mai oukou-e, he pono keia hoi ana mai nei, aole paha he pono. O Kaialea, aia ke paa la i loko o Pakaalana, a o ka poe hou ae nei hoi, ke paa pu la lakou, aole i ikeia ko lakou ola; ina no i make la, make mai la no. Na ke akua ko lakou ola, ke ola mai o nei mau la.”","In the meantime those men who had returned secretly to Kauai, Kaialea’s paddlers and the man who had charge of the canoe, arrived there and were questioned by Hooipoikamalanai: “Where are the rest of you?” They replied: “Don’t think that our return means well; no, there is nothing to rejoice over. Kaialea is in confinement in the temple of Pakaalana, as well as some of the people that came later. They are all in confinement. We cannot speak of their fate. If they have been put to death, then they are dead by this time. If they are still living, then they live through the mercy of God.”"
"He koa kaulana o Piimaiwaa, ma Hawaii a puni, a ma Maui no hoi, no kona koa loa, a me kona makau ole, no kona aa e paio me na enemi e ku ana i mua ona; nolaila, ua punahele ia i kona makuakane alii hanai o Umi. Ma keia kakau ana e ike ai kakou i kona koa lua ole, a me kona makau ole i na enemi, alaila, e pono kakou e olelo he oiaio kona mau olelo hoike.","Piimaiwaa was the most famous of the soldiers of the whole of Hawaii and even of Maui, for his braveness and strength, and it was said that he never failed to go up to meet his enemy. Because of this he was the favorite of the adopted sons of Umi. We will here see that he was indeed the bravest of the brave and fearless of the enemy, so that we too without doubt will say that such is the fact."
"Nana hou ae la no ua o Lonoikamakahiki nei, e kau ana ka ihe kaua, ninau ae la: “Heaha kela?” I aku na kahu: “He mea luku kanaka no, he mea luku aku i na kanaka ke kaua mai, ina i kahi e, e hou aku ai, ku aku la no ke kanaka. A ina he akamai mai kekahi aoao i ka pale ana o ka ihe, alaila, aole e ku.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ae, he mea waiwai ia, aka, o ka mea akamai i ka alo ihe ke kanaka waiwai; nolaila, he hana waiwai ia a kuu makuakane, nolaila, ina eia no kuu piko ke waiho nei, alaila, e nikii pu i kuu piko me ka pua ihe a kuu makuakane.”","Again Lonoikamakahiki looked up and saw a bundle of war spears; he then asked: “What are those things?” The retainers replied: “They are also used to kill people with. In times of war when men are fighting each other these spears are used at close quarters by thrusting, and at long range by throwing, at the enemy. These spears in the hands of strong men can be thrown for some distance. If the person on the other side is of great skill he could ward off one or more spears at a time, and in that way avoid being hit.” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “Yes, those things are of some value; but the person who can skilfully ward them off is of more importance. These things of my father’s are of some value; therefore, if my navel string is still in your keeping, then tie it together with my father’s bundle of war spears.”"
"A lohe o Lonoikamakahiki i keia olelo a ke kahu, he mea puiwa loa ia nona, no kona lohe ana i ka olelo, he hiki ke ike i ke alii waiwai, ame ka waiwai ole, a nolaila, olelo aku la oia i kona mau kahu, me ka i aku: “A, e ike mai no auanei kela elemakule la ia’u?” I aku na kahuna: “Ae, aole oe e nalo, a me kau hana mahope aku.” I hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i na kahu: “He kanaka kapu anei kela, aole e kamailio ia aku e kamalii? O na kanaka makua wale no anei?” I aku la na kahu: “Nau e kamailio kela elemakule, i malamaia hoi na kakaolelo ame na kahuna no oukou no na ’lii.”","When Lonoikamakahiki heard these remarks from one of his retainers he was greatly impressed that such a thing could be possible, that is, that the man could tell whether a chief will become rich or poor. He therefore asked of his attendants: “And will that old man be able to recognize me?” The attendants: “Yes, he will not overlook you12 and also your doings in the future.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked them: “Is there any restriction placed on that man, that is, something that will prevent young people from addressing him? And are the grown up people the only ones that are allowed to speak to him?” The attendants replied: “You are indeed privileged to address that old man. Counselors and priests are retained and cared for to be used by the chiefs.”"
"Penei ke mele a Makuakaumana i oli aku ai i Tahiti, ia laua me Paao i holo ai i alii hou no Hawaii, no ka mea, ua pau na alii mua o Hawaii nei i ka hewa, o Kapawa ke alii o Hawaii nei ia manawa, i ke kanaha o na hanauna alii mai a Opuukahonua mai a ia Kapawa. A ia Makuakaumana ma i aneane aku ai e kau i ke awa o Moaulanuiakea ia manawa i oli aku ai o Makuakaumana ia Lonokaeho ke kahuna:","This is how the song runs that Makuakaumana chanted at Tahiti, when he and Paao went to get a new chief for Hawaii nei, because all the old chiefs of Hawaii had sinned, Kapawa being the king of Hawaii at that time, he being of the fortieth generation from the time of Opuukahonua. When Makuakaumana and company were nearing the beach in the harbor of Moaulanuiakea then Makuakaumana chanted to Lonokaeho, the priest of that place:"
"Ma ka hoonohonoho ana i ka mookuauhau mai a Opuukahonua mai, aole i ikeia ko Opuukahonua mau makua, aka, o ka mea i oleloia i loko o ka moolelo o Kualii, mai Tahiti mai o Opuukahonua o ka hele ana mai a noho i Hawaii nei, i ka manawa, aole he kanaka ma keia mau aina. Holo mai o Opuukahonua me kona mau kaikaina elua, o Lolomu a me Mihi, hookahi wahine o Lana, a o lakou na kupuna mua o Hawaii nei. A penei ka laha ana:","In the genealogical tree of Opuukahonua it is not stated who his parents were, but, it is stated in the genealogy of Kualii, that Opuukahonua came from Tahiti to live in Hawaii when these islands were inhabited by human beings. Opuukahonua came with his two younger brothers Lolomu and Mihi and one woman, Lana, and they became the progenitors of the people of Hawaii nei, and this is how they increased:"
"No ka mea, i ka wa i kiiia mai ai o Iwikauikaua e Kanaloapulehu e kau i ka lele, no ka hewa ana o Iwikauikaua no ke kipi ana i na ’lii malalo ona, a kipi aku ia Kanaloakuaana kekahi alii o Maui, a nolaila, ia Iwikauikaua i ku ai iluna o ka anuu, nana ae la o Iwikauikaua i ke kahuna ia Kukailani, a kahea aku la: “E, ka pule a ke kahuna, kulia i mua o ke akua, na na mai ia’u ina he kahuna oe na’u.” A lohe o Kukailani i keia mea: “Ae, e ku wau i kuu pule a i ino kuu pule make oe, aka i hololea kuu pule a hiki i ka amama ana; aole oe e kau i ka lele i keia la.” A penei ka pule ana:","On the day when Iwikauikaua was taken by Kanaloapulehu to be sacrificed on the altar of the temple, because Iwikauikaua had done wrong in promoting rebellion amongst the subordinate chiefs under him to rebel against Kanaloakuaana, a king of Maui, then when Iwikauikaua stood on the steps of the altar he looked to the priest, Kukailani and appealed to him: “O prayer of the priest, stand thou before the deity that he may look towards me, if thou art indeed my priest.” When Kukailani heard this call he answered: “Yes, I will stand and pray, but if my prayer is not propitious you will die; but if my prayer is uninterrupted to the Amen you will not die today.”"
"O keia ka pule i oleloia i loko o ka molelo o Kamalalawalu. A ma keia mele pule i maopopo ai he pono ke mahele i mau wa. No ka mea, aia wale no ma na ’lii aimoku e ili ai ke kapu moku. A mehe mea la, ua hoomaopopoia na wa ma ia mau ano e like me na pauku mele pule maluna ae.","This is the prayer that is referred to in the genealogy of Kamalalawalu. And it is shown by the construction of this poetical prayer that time should be divided into epochs. Because it is only on the reigning kings that the kapu of the islands are conferred, and it would seem time and epochs were divided as shown by the division of the chant referred to above."
"Ua oleloia ma ka moolelo o Hawaii nei, i paiia ma Lahainaluna, a me ka moolelo i hooponopono hou ia e Mr. Pokuea o Lahainaluna, ua ku mua mai kekahi moku ma Hawaii nei i ka wa kahiko, a oia ka hoomaka mua ana o keia lahui e ike i na haole. Aka hoi, ma ka moolelo o Kualii kekahi alii kahiko o Hawaii nei, ke alii kaulana no ka ikaika i ke kaua; ua oleloia, nana i ike mua o Tahiti, a oia ka mea i ike mua i na haole i ka wa kahiko, a penei ka hoomaopopo ana ma kona pule, ma ka hapa waena o kona moolelo e like me malalo iho:","It is told in the history of Hawaii that was printed at Lahainaluna, and also in the history revised by Pogue of Lahainaluna, that a vessel of some kind had arrived at Hawaii long ago, and that was the first knowledge the people of this race had of foreigners; but in the history of Kualii, one of the former kings of Hawaii nei and a famous one for his strength and valor in battle, it is said that he was the first one to visit Tahiti, and that he was the one that first knew or met foreigners in the olden times. This is how that is recognized by his prayer in the middle of his history as recited below:"
"Mai ka hiapo a ka mua ponoi o Aukelenuiaiku, aole o Iku i hii, aole i lawelawe, aole hoi i hooili i ka aina no kekahi o lakou, aole no hoi i hoopunahele. A ia Aukelenuiaiku, malama o Iku, lawelawe a hii, a hooili i kona kapu a me ka aina nona. A no keia punahele o Aukelenuiaiku i ko lakou makuakane, ua huhu kona mau hoahanau ia ia, a ua imi lakou i mea nona e make ai. Wahi a ko lakou kaikuaana loa, a Kamakahinuiaiku: “Kupanaha ko kakou makuakane, ia’u hoi i ke keiki mua, aole i hooili mai i kona kapu a me ka aina, a i ke keiki hope loa, ia ia ka e hooili ai.”","From the first-born child to the one just ahead of Aukelenuiaiku, Iku never took them up in his arms, never spoke of leaving the kingdom to any of them, nor did he make much of any of them. But at the birth of Aukelenuiaiku, Iku took the greatest interest in him, took care of him, took him up in his arms, and to him he willed all his honor and glory and the kingdom. Because of this show of favoritism on their father’s part toward Aukelenuiaiku, his brothers and sister hated him and they tried to devise some way of getting rid of him. Said the oldest of the children, Kamakahinuiaiku:4 “Yes, our father is indeed strange; although I am the first-born, still our father did not promise to leave me his honor and glory, and not even the kingdom, but here with the last son he has promised to leave these things to him.”"
"Maanei e ike ai kakou i ka poino o Aukelenuiaiku, a me kona pakele ana i ka make a kona kaikuaana kuhu, aloha ole. A haule o Aukelenuiaiku i loko o ka lua, kahea iho ua kaikuaana huhu la, penei: “E, Kamooinanea e, eia mai ko ai la, ai ia mai.” Ia ia e kahea ana, holo mai la kekahi kaikuaana o Aukelenuiaiku (he kaikuaana aloha ia ia), kahea iho la ma ka waha o ka lua: “E, Kamooinanea e! mai ai mai oe, o ko moopuna mai na o Aukelenuiaiku e lele aku la.” Ma keia haule ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua olioli loa kona poe kaikuaana huhu ia ia, no kona make ana, e manao ana lako ua make io no o Aukelenuiaiku. Ma keia haule ana o Aukelenuiaiku, manao lakou, ua lilo kona kapu i mea ole, a ua nele ka olelo hooilina a ko lakou makuakane maluna ona, a ua lilo i mea ole loa.","We will here see how Aukelenuiaiku got into trouble and how he escaped the terrible death intended for him by his cruel and merciless brothers. As Aukelenuiaiku was falling down the pit, the angry brother called out: “Say, Kamooinanea, here is your food; eat him up.” While he was calling, one of his younger brothers, a kind one, came up running and called down the pit, saying: “Say, Kamooinanea, don’t eat him up, for he is your own grandson, Aukelenuiaiku, that is being thrown down.” After Aukelenuiaiku had fallen into the pit his older brothers were much pleased, believing that they had now gotten rid of him; that he was really dead; and their father’s promise on him would be unfulfilled, and become utterly void."
"Ia lakou e kamailio ana, hoea hou mai la ua moo nei, a kahea mai la: “E, Aukelenuiaiku e, e haawi mai oe i kekahi kanaka na’u.” Hoole aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Aole e loaa aku ia oe ke kanaka.” A lohe ua moo nei i keia olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, i mai la ia: “E haawi mai oe ia’u i hookahi kanaka, i aha kau uku o ka hiki ana mai i anei? no ka mea, ua haawi ia mai oe he kanaka make, e ai aku wau ia oe, aka, nana ae nei au ia oe, a o ka mea i puka pono aku mai loko o’u, nolaila, aole au e ai aku ia oe.” Ma keia olelo a ua moo la, ua ae aku o Aukelenuiaiku, a ua manao iho la ia e hooko i ka olelo a kona kupunawahine moo, a Kamooinanea.

A pau na kanaka elua, koe iho la o Aukelenuiaiku, ia wa, hoi mai la ua moo nei a noho i luna.","While the men were still conversing the lizard again made its appearance and called out: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, let me have one of the men.” Aukelenuiaiku again refused, saying: “No, you cannot have one of them.” When the lizard heard this it said: “You must give me one of the men. What are you going to pay me for coming here? Because you have been given to me to be killed and that I should devour you, but since I have found out that you are one of those that have gone out of my own body, I cannot eat you up.” When the lizard concluded, Aukelenuiaiku gave his consent, for he thought within himself that the request of his lizard grandmother, Kamooinanea, should be granted. He then gave one of the men to the lizard. As soon as the man was offered, he was swallowed whole. After this first man was consumed the lizard again asked that the second man be given her. Aukelenuiaiku again gave the second man, and he too was swallowed whole. After the second man was consumed there was left only Aukelenuiaiku. The lizard then came out of the sea and laid on the dry sand."
"A pau ka olelo ana a ka moo ia Aukelenuiaiku, alaila, kapili iho la ia i pahu no ke ’kua o Aukelenuiaiku, a paa ka pahu, hoo iho la ia i ke ’kua i loko, oia o Lonoikoualii. A olelo mai la ia Aukelenuiaiku: “O ko akua no nei puni ko aina ia oe; eia ko ai a me ko ia, o Laukahi. He lau maona, pa no i ka lehelehe maona; o ka manawa e maona ai, eha malama e noho ai, alaila, ai hou.” Lalau iho la ua kupunawahine nei i ke koi, a me ka pahi, a hahao iho la i loko o ka pahu, a ooki iho la i kona huelo, a haawi aku la i ka moopuna, i aku la: “O kuu kino maoli keia, oia ka ia oe, a o kuu pau ai kaua, a me kuu kahili ai kaua no ko kaikuahine ia.

Eia ka auanei o Namakaokahai no.","At the end of the remarks of the lizard to Aukelenuiaiku, she made a box to hold the god of Aukelenuiaiku. After the box was built she put the god into it, who was Lonoikoualii, and said to Aukelenuiaiku: “With this god you will conquer and become possessed of the land that I have just described. Here is your food and meat; it is a laukahi. This leaf is wholesome; as soon as you touch it to your lips your hunger is satisfied; and when satisfied you can go without eating for a period of four months.” The grandmother then took up an axe and a knife and put them into the box. The lizard next cut off its tail and gave it to the grandson, saying: “This is my real body, which you must take with you. Here are also my pau of feathers and my feather kahili which shall act as your preserver when you meet your cousin. With these things in your possession—that is, by wearing the pau and holding this kahili you will cause your enemies to fall and turn into ashes.” The lizard then explained the uses of all the different things to her grandson, and she also taught him how to preserve these things of magic; but she did not tell him the name of the cousin. She was Namakaokahai."
"A make o Aukelenuiaiku, hoi aku la ua kaikuaana la, a hiki i kahi a na kaikaina e noho ana.

When the brother who entertained some love for Aukelenuiaiku saw their oldest brother coming back, he asked: “Where is our brother?” The oldest brother replied: “I have not seen him, and he was not at the place where I went to.” After this the brother who wished to save Aukelenuiaiku got up and went out in search of him. In this search he went to their home, where he learned that Aukelenuiaiku had not returned. He then took up the loin cloth of his brother, and wore it round his neck and wept. While he was weeping their father Iku heard it, and so he inquired: “Who is this weeping?” “I, Ikumailani.” “What are you weeping for?” “I am weeping for Aukelenuiaiku; he is dead.” When their father heard this he also wept."
