"A loaa o Aukelenuiaiku, hoi mai la laua a hiki i ka hale kahi o ko laua makuakane e noho ana, lele mai la ko laua makuakane uwe, a me na mea a pau loa. O ka nui o na la o keia kaawale ana ewalu la. Mamua ae o ka loaa ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua paa ka moku o na kaikuaana i ke kapili, a ua makaukau e holo, ua lana i loko o ke kai. Ma keia ola hou ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua lohe ua kaikuaana huhu lokoino nei, ua hoi mai o Aukelenuiaiku, a nona keia makena e uwe ia mai nei. Nolaila, kena ae la ia e hoomakaukau ka holo, e kahu ke o, a e ee i luna o ka moku.","After Aukelenuiaiku was found he was brought home to their father who fell on his son and wept for joy, as did all the others, for he had been lost for about eight days. Before Aukelenuiaiku was found, the ship of the brothers was completed and preparations were made for departure, as it had been launched. When the oldest brother saw that Aukelenuiaiku was again back safe and well, and that the wailing that he had heard was because of the return of Aukelenuiaiku, he immediately gave orders that the final preparations be completed; that the food be cooked, and after that everybody was to go aboard."
"Mahope iho o ko Moikeha make ana, laweia aku la kona kupapau ma ka pali o Haena, a hiki i ka manawa a Kila i hoihoi ai i Tahiti. Ia manawa mahope iho, noho iho la o Kila ma ko Moikeha noho ana, e like me ka makemake o kona makuakane, a me kona mau makuahine, a me ka makuakane o na makuahine.","After the death of Moikeha, his dead body was taken to the cliffs of Haena where it was deposited until a convenient time for Kila to remove it to Tahiti. Soon after this Kila began to assume the reins of government and ruled in place of Moikeha, according to the wish of his late father, his mother and aunt, and his mother’s father."
"A lohe na makuahine o lakou i keia olelo, kanikau hele aku la o Hooipoikamalanai, e hoonaauaua ana ia laua iho me Hinauu. I aku la o Hooipoikamalanai ma i ka laua mau keiki: “Auhea la hoi na iwi o ko oukou makuakane?” I mai la kana mau keiki: “Ua lilo i ka moana, ia kahuli ana no o makou, lilo makou ia Kila kahi i aumeume ai, aole o makou manao ae i kela.” A mahope iho o keia manawa, kanikau hele aku la o Hinauu ma i ke aloha o Kila a puni o Kauai, a huipu aku la me na makaainana i ke kanikau.","When the mothers heard this account of the death of Kila, Hoopoikamalanai and her sister Hinauu wailed and expressed a desire to take their own lives, their grief for their son was so great. Hooipoikamalanai and her sister then inquired of their sons: “Where, then, are the bones of your father?” The sons replied: “We lost them in the ocean. When our canoe was overturned we all went to the rescue of Kila, and therefore the bones of our father were neglected and they disappeared.” After this Hinauu and her sister traveled around Kauai mourning for Kila, in which the common people also joined with them."
"A hala aku la na kaikuaana o Kila, noho iho la o Kila ia koena po, e noonoo ana i ka hana a kona mau kaikuaana. A kokoke i ka wanaao, a no ka loihi o kona ala ana ia po, nolaila, ua pauhiaia oia e ka hiamoe nui. A ia ia e hiamoe ana, ua hiki ae ka la, a mehana iki ae, ike ia mai la ua o Kila e hiamoe ana i kaha one. Hele mai na kamaaina a ike i keia keiki maikai e moe ana, ua pauhia i ka hiamoe. A nolaila, hoala ia ae la, me ka ninau iho o na kamaaina, i kona wahi i hele mai ai a me ke ano o kona hiki ana malaila. Alaila, hai aku la oia i ka moolelo e like me ka hana a kona mau kaikuaana. A no ia mea, hoihoi ia aku la e na kamaaina ma kauhale kamaaina.","After the brothers had gone, Kila remained the rest of the night in meditation, trying to comprehend the object of his brothers’ actions. Toward morning he fell into a deep sleep after sitting up most of the night. While he was asleep and the sun was rising higher and higher, he was seen by the people, who came to admire this handsome young man who was fast asleep on the sand. At last the people woke him up and asked him where he had come from and the circumstances of his arrival at this place. He then told them the whole history of his treatment by his brothers. He was then taken to the home of one of the men."
"Aka, lohe ae la na kaikuaana o Kila, aia ka ai ma Waipio, manao ae la ko lakou kupunakane, a me ko lakou makuahine e holo i ai i Waipio; aka, aole nae e hiki ia lakou ke ae e hele, no ka mea, ua hana hewa aku lakou ia Kila malaila, oia no ko lakou mea i kanalua ai, o hele auanei lakou, o ike mai o Kila ia lakou, nolaila pono ole. Aka no ka paipai nui o ko lakou makuahine i na keiki e holo, hoole loa aku na keiki. A no ka paakiki loa o na keiki ma ko lakou manao, nolaila, ninau pakahi aku la ko lakou mau makuahine i ka laua mau keiki, no ka makemake e holo i ai i Waipio. Aka ua hoole na mea a pau o na keiki ana; a ma kekahi manawa mahope mai, ninau pinepine aku no i na keiki; ekolu keiki i hoole, a hookahi mea i ae e hele i ka ai i Waipio, o Kaialea.","When Kila’s brothers heard that there was food at Waipio, their grandfather and mothers made up their minds to send the boys to Waipio for food; but none of the boys were willing to go, because it was at this place that they had abandoned Kila to his fate; so they were very reluctant about going, for fear that he might see them and there would be trouble. As often as their mothers urged them to go they as often refused, and finally they told their mothers that on no condition would they think of going. Upon meeting this persistent refusal on the part of their sons, the mothers determined to ask them one by one, to see if there was not a chance to persuade one of them to go, but every one of them refused. The mothers would not have no for an answer, and kept on urging the sons till finally one of the boys, Kaialea, consented to go to Waipio to get them some food."
"A o ko Kauai poe hoi, ua kali ia mai la o Kaialea, aole he hoi aku, nolaila, hoouna ia kekahi mau kanaka e Hooipoikamalanai ma e huli ia Kaialea. Ia huli ia ana a hiki i Hawaii ma Waipio. Ia manawa a lakou i hiki aku ai, ninau ia mai la lakou nei, ko Kauai poe, i ke kumu o ko lakou hiki ana i laila. Aka hai aku la lakou, “he huakai imi alii, e imi ana ia Kaialea.” A no kea mea, hai aku la na kamaaina: “Ua make o Kaialea, aia maloko o ka heiau, ua oleloia nae e kau ana i ka lele, aka, aole nae i ikeia ke kau ana i ka lele, ua make malu paha, ua kiola ia paha maloko o ka lua pau.”","In the meantime the people on Kauai awaited Kaialea’s return. But after a long wait without hearing anything of him, Hooipoikamalanai and her sister sent a party of men to come and institute a search for him. On this voyage, the party arrived at Waipio, Hawaii. Upon their arrival they were asked why they had come, so they replied that they were in search of a chief, Kaialea by name. On learning the mission of the strangers, the Waipio people informed them that he had been condemned to be put to death. They further told the strangers that Kaialea was now in confinement in the temple, and it had been reported that he was to be sacrificed, but so far no one had seen him sacrificed, but it was possible that he had been put to death secretly. On the other hand he might have been thrown in a deep pit."
"A o na kanaka hoi i hoi malu ai i ka po, na hoewaa i holo pu mai me Kaialea, a me kekahi kanaka i hoouna hopeia mai e Hooipoikamalanai, hoi aku la lakou a hiki i Kauai; ninau mai la o Hooipoikamalanai: “Auhea hoi ko oukou nui?” I aku la lakou: “I mai oukou-e, he pono keia hoi ana mai nei, aole paha he pono. O Kaialea, aia ke paa la i loko o Pakaalana, a o ka poe hou ae nei hoi, ke paa pu la lakou, aole i ikeia ko lakou ola; ina no i make la, make mai la no. Na ke akua ko lakou ola, ke ola mai o nei mau la.”","In the meantime those men who had returned secretly to Kauai, Kaialea’s paddlers and the man who had charge of the canoe, arrived there and were questioned by Hooipoikamalanai: “Where are the rest of you?” They replied: “Don’t think that our return means well; no, there is nothing to rejoice over. Kaialea is in confinement in the temple of Pakaalana, as well as some of the people that came later. They are all in confinement. We cannot speak of their fate. If they have been put to death, then they are dead by this time. If they are still living, then they live through the mercy of God.”"
"He koa kaulana o Piimaiwaa, ma Hawaii a puni, a ma Maui no hoi, no kona koa loa, a me kona makau ole, no kona aa e paio me na enemi e ku ana i mua ona; nolaila, ua punahele ia i kona makuakane alii hanai o Umi. Ma keia kakau ana e ike ai kakou i kona koa lua ole, a me kona makau ole i na enemi, alaila, e pono kakou e olelo he oiaio kona mau olelo hoike.","Piimaiwaa was the most famous of the soldiers of the whole of Hawaii and even of Maui, for his braveness and strength, and it was said that he never failed to go up to meet his enemy. Because of this he was the favorite of the adopted sons of Umi. We will here see that he was indeed the bravest of the brave and fearless of the enemy, so that we too without doubt will say that such is the fact."
"Nana hou ae la no ua o Lonoikamakahiki nei, e kau ana ka ihe kaua, ninau ae la: “Heaha kela?” I aku na kahu: “He mea luku kanaka no, he mea luku aku i na kanaka ke kaua mai, ina i kahi e, e hou aku ai, ku aku la no ke kanaka. A ina he akamai mai kekahi aoao i ka pale ana o ka ihe, alaila, aole e ku.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ae, he mea waiwai ia, aka, o ka mea akamai i ka alo ihe ke kanaka waiwai; nolaila, he hana waiwai ia a kuu makuakane, nolaila, ina eia no kuu piko ke waiho nei, alaila, e nikii pu i kuu piko me ka pua ihe a kuu makuakane.”","Again Lonoikamakahiki looked up and saw a bundle of war spears; he then asked: “What are those things?” The retainers replied: “They are also used to kill people with. In times of war when men are fighting each other these spears are used at close quarters by thrusting, and at long range by throwing, at the enemy. These spears in the hands of strong men can be thrown for some distance. If the person on the other side is of great skill he could ward off one or more spears at a time, and in that way avoid being hit.” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “Yes, those things are of some value; but the person who can skilfully ward them off is of more importance. These things of my father’s are of some value; therefore, if my navel string is still in your keeping, then tie it together with my father’s bundle of war spears.”"
"A lohe o Lonoikamakahiki i keia olelo a ke kahu, he mea puiwa loa ia nona, no kona lohe ana i ka olelo, he hiki ke ike i ke alii waiwai, ame ka waiwai ole, a nolaila, olelo aku la oia i kona mau kahu, me ka i aku: “A, e ike mai no auanei kela elemakule la ia’u?” I aku na kahuna: “Ae, aole oe e nalo, a me kau hana mahope aku.” I hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i na kahu: “He kanaka kapu anei kela, aole e kamailio ia aku e kamalii? O na kanaka makua wale no anei?” I aku la na kahu: “Nau e kamailio kela elemakule, i malamaia hoi na kakaolelo ame na kahuna no oukou no na ’lii.”","When Lonoikamakahiki heard these remarks from one of his retainers he was greatly impressed that such a thing could be possible, that is, that the man could tell whether a chief will become rich or poor. He therefore asked of his attendants: “And will that old man be able to recognize me?” The attendants: “Yes, he will not overlook you12 and also your doings in the future.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked them: “Is there any restriction placed on that man, that is, something that will prevent young people from addressing him? And are the grown up people the only ones that are allowed to speak to him?” The attendants replied: “You are indeed privileged to address that old man. Counselors and priests are retained and cared for to be used by the chiefs.”"
"Penei ke mele a Makuakaumana i oli aku ai i Tahiti, ia laua me Paao i holo ai i alii hou no Hawaii, no ka mea, ua pau na alii mua o Hawaii nei i ka hewa, o Kapawa ke alii o Hawaii nei ia manawa, i ke kanaha o na hanauna alii mai a Opuukahonua mai a ia Kapawa. A ia Makuakaumana ma i aneane aku ai e kau i ke awa o Moaulanuiakea ia manawa i oli aku ai o Makuakaumana ia Lonokaeho ke kahuna:","This is how the song runs that Makuakaumana chanted at Tahiti, when he and Paao went to get a new chief for Hawaii nei, because all the old chiefs of Hawaii had sinned, Kapawa being the king of Hawaii at that time, he being of the fortieth generation from the time of Opuukahonua. When Makuakaumana and company were nearing the beach in the harbor of Moaulanuiakea then Makuakaumana chanted to Lonokaeho, the priest of that place:"
"Ma ka hoonohonoho ana i ka mookuauhau mai a Opuukahonua mai, aole i ikeia ko Opuukahonua mau makua, aka, o ka mea i oleloia i loko o ka moolelo o Kualii, mai Tahiti mai o Opuukahonua o ka hele ana mai a noho i Hawaii nei, i ka manawa, aole he kanaka ma keia mau aina. Holo mai o Opuukahonua me kona mau kaikaina elua, o Lolomu a me Mihi, hookahi wahine o Lana, a o lakou na kupuna mua o Hawaii nei. A penei ka laha ana:","In the genealogical tree of Opuukahonua it is not stated who his parents were, but, it is stated in the genealogy of Kualii, that Opuukahonua came from Tahiti to live in Hawaii when these islands were inhabited by human beings. Opuukahonua came with his two younger brothers Lolomu and Mihi and one woman, Lana, and they became the progenitors of the people of Hawaii nei, and this is how they increased:"
"No ka mea, i ka wa i kiiia mai ai o Iwikauikaua e Kanaloapulehu e kau i ka lele, no ka hewa ana o Iwikauikaua no ke kipi ana i na ’lii malalo ona, a kipi aku ia Kanaloakuaana kekahi alii o Maui, a nolaila, ia Iwikauikaua i ku ai iluna o ka anuu, nana ae la o Iwikauikaua i ke kahuna ia Kukailani, a kahea aku la: “E, ka pule a ke kahuna, kulia i mua o ke akua, na na mai ia’u ina he kahuna oe na’u.” A lohe o Kukailani i keia mea: “Ae, e ku wau i kuu pule a i ino kuu pule make oe, aka i hololea kuu pule a hiki i ka amama ana; aole oe e kau i ka lele i keia la.” A penei ka pule ana:","On the day when Iwikauikaua was taken by Kanaloapulehu to be sacrificed on the altar of the temple, because Iwikauikaua had done wrong in promoting rebellion amongst the subordinate chiefs under him to rebel against Kanaloakuaana, a king of Maui, then when Iwikauikaua stood on the steps of the altar he looked to the priest, Kukailani and appealed to him: “O prayer of the priest, stand thou before the deity that he may look towards me, if thou art indeed my priest.” When Kukailani heard this call he answered: “Yes, I will stand and pray, but if my prayer is not propitious you will die; but if my prayer is uninterrupted to the Amen you will not die today.”"
"O keia ka pule i oleloia i loko o ka molelo o Kamalalawalu. A ma keia mele pule i maopopo ai he pono ke mahele i mau wa. No ka mea, aia wale no ma na ’lii aimoku e ili ai ke kapu moku. A mehe mea la, ua hoomaopopoia na wa ma ia mau ano e like me na pauku mele pule maluna ae.","This is the prayer that is referred to in the genealogy of Kamalalawalu. And it is shown by the construction of this poetical prayer that time should be divided into epochs. Because it is only on the reigning kings that the kapu of the islands are conferred, and it would seem time and epochs were divided as shown by the division of the chant referred to above."
"Ua oleloia ma ka moolelo o Hawaii nei, i paiia ma Lahainaluna, a me ka moolelo i hooponopono hou ia e Mr. Pokuea o Lahainaluna, ua ku mua mai kekahi moku ma Hawaii nei i ka wa kahiko, a oia ka hoomaka mua ana o keia lahui e ike i na haole.

This is how that is recognized by his prayer in the middle of his history as recited below:"
"Mai ka hiapo a ka mua ponoi o Aukelenuiaiku, aole o Iku i hii, aole i lawelawe, aole hoi i hooili i ka aina no kekahi o lakou, aole no hoi i hoopunahele. A ia Aukelenuiaiku, malama o Iku, lawelawe a hii, a hooili i kona kapu a me ka aina nona. A no keia punahele o Aukelenuiaiku i ko lakou makuakane, ua huhu kona mau hoahanau ia ia, a ua imi lakou i mea nona e make ai.

But at the birth of Aukelenuiaiku, Iku took the greatest interest in him, took care of him, took him up in his arms, and to him he willed all his honor and glory and the kingdom. Because of this show of favoritism on their father’s part toward Aukelenuiaiku, his brothers and sister hated him and they tried to devise some way of getting rid of him. Said the oldest of the children, Kamakahinuiaiku:4 “Yes, our father is indeed strange; although I am the first-born, still our father did not promise to leave me his honor and glory, and not even the kingdom, but here with the last son he has promised to leave these things to him.”"
"Maanei e ike ai kakou i ka poino o Aukelenuiaiku, a me kona pakele ana i ka make a kona kaikuaana kuhu, aloha ole. A haule o Aukelenuiaiku i loko o ka lua, kahea iho ua kaikuaana huhu la, penei: “E, Kamooinanea e, eia mai ko ai la, ai ia mai.” Ia ia e kahea ana, holo mai la kekahi kaikuaana o Aukelenuiaiku (he kaikuaana aloha ia ia), kahea iho la ma ka waha o ka lua: “E, Kamooinanea e! mai ai mai oe, o ko moopuna mai na o Aukelenuiaiku e lele aku la.” Ma keia haule ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua olioli loa kona poe kaikuaana huhu ia ia, no kona make ana, e manao ana lako ua make io no o Aukelenuiaiku. Ma keia haule ana o Aukelenuiaiku, manao lakou, ua lilo kona kapu i mea ole, a ua nele ka olelo hooilina a ko lakou makuakane maluna ona, a ua lilo i mea ole loa.","We will here see how Aukelenuiaiku got into trouble and how he escaped the terrible death intended for him by his cruel and merciless brothers. As Aukelenuiaiku was falling down the pit, the angry brother called out: “Say, Kamooinanea, here is your food; eat him up.” While he was calling, one of his younger brothers, a kind one, came up running and called down the pit, saying: “Say, Kamooinanea, don’t eat him up, for he is your own grandson, Aukelenuiaiku, that is being thrown down.” After Aukelenuiaiku had fallen into the pit his older brothers were much pleased, believing that they had now gotten rid of him; that he was really dead; and their father’s promise on him would be unfulfilled, and become utterly void."
"Ia lakou e kamailio ana, hoea hou mai la ua moo nei, a kahea mai la: “E, Aukelenuiaiku e, e haawi mai oe i kekahi kanaka na’u.” Hoole aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Aole e loaa aku ia oe ke kanaka.” A lohe ua moo nei i keia olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, i mai la ia: “E haawi mai oe ia’u i hookahi kanaka, i aha kau uku o ka hiki ana mai i anei? no ka mea, ua haawi ia mai oe he kanaka make, e ai aku wau ia oe, aka, nana ae nei au ia oe, a o ka mea i puka pono aku mai loko o’u, nolaila, aole au e ai aku ia oe.” Ma keia olelo a ua moo la, ua ae aku o Aukelenuiaiku, a ua manao iho la ia e hooko i ka olelo a kona kupunawahine moo, a Kamooinanea.

A pau na kanaka elua, koe iho la o Aukelenuiaiku, ia wa, hoi mai la ua moo nei a noho i luna.","While the men were still conversing the lizard again made its appearance and called out: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, let me have one of the men.” Aukelenuiaiku again refused, saying: “No, you cannot have one of them.” When the lizard heard this it said: “You must give me one of the men. What are you going to pay me for coming here? Because you have been given to me to be killed and that I should devour you, but since I have found out that you are one of those that have gone out of my own body, I cannot eat you up.” When the lizard concluded, Aukelenuiaiku gave his consent, for he thought within himself that the request of his lizard grandmother, Kamooinanea, should be granted. He then gave one of the men to the lizard. As soon as the man was offered, he was swallowed whole. After this first man was consumed the lizard again asked that the second man be given her. Aukelenuiaiku again gave the second man, and he too was swallowed whole. After the second man was consumed there was left only Aukelenuiaiku. The lizard then came out of the sea and laid on the dry sand."
"A pau ka olelo ana a ka moo ia Aukelenuiaiku, alaila, kapili iho la ia i pahu no ke ’kua o Aukelenuiaiku, a paa ka pahu, hoo iho la ia i ke ’kua i loko, oia o Lonoikoualii.

Eia ka auanei o Namakaokahai no.","At the end of the remarks of the lizard to Aukelenuiaiku, she made a box to hold the god of Aukelenuiaiku. After the box was built she put the god into it, who was Lonoikoualii, and said to Aukelenuiaiku: “With this god you will conquer and become possessed of the land that I have just described. Here is your food and meat; it is a laukahi. This leaf is wholesome; as soon as you touch it to your lips your hunger is satisfied; and when satisfied you can go without eating for a period of four months.” The grandmother then took up an axe and a knife and put them into the box. The lizard next cut off its tail and gave it to the grandson, saying: “This is my real body, which you must take with you. Here are also my pau of feathers and my feather kahili which shall act as your preserver when you meet your cousin. With these things in your possession—that is, by wearing the pau and holding this kahili you will cause your enemies to fall and turn into ashes.” The lizard then explained the uses of all the different things to her grandson, and she also taught him how to preserve these things of magic; but she did not tell him the name of the cousin. She was Namakaokahai."
"A make o Aukelenuiaiku, hoi aku la ua kaikuaana la, a hiki i kahi a na kaikaina e noho ana.

When the brother who entertained some love for Aukelenuiaiku saw their oldest brother coming back, he asked: “Where is our brother?” The oldest brother replied: “I have not seen him, and he was not at the place where I went to.” After this the brother who wished to save Aukelenuiaiku got up and went out in search of him. In this search he went to their home, where he learned that Aukelenuiaiku had not returned. He then took up the loin cloth of his brother, and wore it round his neck and wept. While he was weeping their father Iku heard it, and so he inquired: “Who is this weeping?” “I, Ikumailani.” “What are you weeping for?” “I am weeping for Aukelenuiaiku; he is dead.” When their father heard this he also wept.""Maanei e hoomaopopo ai kakou i ko Piikea mau hoahanau; o ka mua o Piilani, he kane ia, o kona muli o Piikea (nona keia olelo ana); o Kihapiilani kona muli iho, he kane, o Kalaniapiilani kona muli iho he kane no, ua make mua nae ia.

The first-born of the family was Piilani, a boy; the one following after him was Piikea whom we have already been introduced to as the wife of Umi. Following her was Kihapiilani, another boy; and the last of the family was Kalanipiilani, also a boy, who died young. Piilani was the heir to the kingdom of Maui, while his younger brother and sister, Kihapiilani and Piikea, were placed under him. This was the expressed will of Piilani to them, but Piilani disregarded the words of their father."
"Ia Piilani e noho ana i ka aina o Maui a puni, noho pu iho la ia me kona kaikaina me Kihapiilani ma Kauiki, ma Hana. Ma keia noho ana, aole malama o Piilani i kona pokii, e like me ke kauoha a ko lakou makuakane, mamua ae o ka wa make.

While living together Piilani did not care for his brother according to the instructions of their father before his death. It was customary with Piilani while eating, or sitting in company, to care more for the others than his brother Kihapiilani. Every time his brother was around he would show a marked degree of hatred towards him, and he evinced his displeasure in many ways."
"I kekahi la, e ai ana o Piilani me kona mau hoa ai, he poe e wale no, aia i mua o lakou ka ai a me ka ia; a o Kihapiilani hoi kona pokii, aole ana ia e ai ana; aka, aia i mua o kona alo, he ipu ohua, na Piilani; lalau aku la ia elua ohua a ai iho la. Ma keia ai ana a Kihapiilani, ike mai la o Piilani; lalau mai la ia i ka ipukai ohua a paa i ka lima, ninau mai la o Piilani: “Nawai la i ai iho nei i ka ipukai ohua?” I aku o Kihapiilani: “Na’u no, no ka mea aole a’u ia.” Ia wa kiola o Piilani i ka ipukai ohua, me ke kai o loko a pa i ka lae o Kihapiilani, naha ae la ka ipukai ohua, a paumaele ka maka i ke kai o ka ohua, a wewela loa iho la.","One day while Piilani was eating with his companions, all strangers, enjoying the good things placed before them, Kihapiilani, although present at the table, was not served with any of the good things; but, in front of him was placed a small calabash containing some small fish. This dish belonged to Piilani. Seeing that this was all there was to be had within reach, he reached into the dish and took out two small fish and ate them. While doing this he was seen by Piilani. Piilani then reached for the dish and held it up in his hand, then asked of Kihapiilani: “Who ate of the fish in this dish?” Kihapiilani replied: “I did, because there was nothing else for me to eat.” Piilani then threw the dish with the fish in it, brine and all, at the forehead of his brother, breaking the dish into pieces and spattering the fish and brine into the eyes of Kihapiilani which blinded him for a while."
"No keia hana ino aloha ole a kona kaikuaana ia ia, hele aku la ia me ka mahuka, a noho ma Kalaniwai ma Makawao. I ko Kihapiilani noho ana ma laila, moe iho la ia ma laila i ka wahine, aole nae lakou i ike o Kihapiilani keia, he ’lii, aka, i ko lakou manao, he kanaka kuaaina loa. Nolaila, olelo na makuahunowai o Kihapiilani, i ka palaualelo, i ka moe wale iho no i ka hale, aole hana.

Ina hookahi anuenue, alaila, he kahuna; aka, ina elua, he ’lii.” Ma keia noonoo o laua, ua holo ia laua, he ’lii, a ua lohe ia no hoi ka nalowale ana o Kihapiilani.","Because of this ill treatment by his elder brother, showing no love or respect for him, Kihapiilani got up and secretly ran away to Kalaniwai, a place in Makawao. While there he met a woman belonging to the place and they were united and lived as husband and wife. The people of the place, however, did not know that this was Kihapiilani, the chief, but took him to be a man from the country. While living with his wife’s parents he was often spoken of as a lazy fellow, spending his time sleeping instead of going out to work. When Kihapiilani heard his wife’s parents speak of him [ ] as being a lazy fellow, he got up and went down to get potato stalks in the lowlands of Kaluaama at Haiku. Upon his arrival at this place, an old man by the name of Kukuiokaaulani saw him and recognized him as of high rank; so he said to his companion, another old man: “Say, that man that is coming down is either a chief or a priest.” After a while he again remarked: “It must be a chief. If there was but one rainbow, then it would be a priest; but since there are two it must surely be a chief.” The two finally decided that the person was a chief, for the fact of the disappearance of Kihapiilani was well known. The two old men then waited for the approach of the stranger. As soon as he came up to them they greeted him, saying: “Our salutation to the chief.” Kihapiilani then admonished them, saying: “Be quiet. Since you two have recognized me you must not reveal my identity.”"
"Noho iho la laua a hiki mai la o Kihapiilani, aloha aku la laua: “Aloha ke ’lii.” Hamau aku la o Kihapiilani: “Hamau ko olua mau waha; he nani ia, ua ike iho la olua ia’u, e huna olua ia’u, mai hoike olua.” A pau ka halawai ana me na elemakule, iho aku la keia a hiki i Kaluaama, malaila ka lau uala e ulu ana, ako iho la o Kihapiilani. Ma keia ako ana a Kihapiilani, lalau iho la ia i ka lau o ka pue uala, a pua ae la a paa, apahu ae la, me ke koe ole o kekahi lau uala, no ka pue.","After this Kihapiilani continued on his way until he came to Kaluaama, where a large patch of sweet potatoes was growing. Kihapiilani then proceeded to pick a quantity of stalks, taking and breaking them from the vines, leaving the hills bare. While he was thus busily picking stalks the owner of the patch arrived, and upon seeing what Kihapiilani was doing he came up to him and began beating him with a stick, but Kihapiilani paid no attention to his beating but kept on picking stalks. After he had picked a quantity sufficient for his purpose he tied them into a large pack, placed the pack on to his back and started for the uplands of Kalaniwai."
"Ia ia e ako ana, hiki mai la ka mea nana ka mala uala, a ike iho la ia, kumakena, hahau mai la ia ia Kihapiilani i ka laau, aole nae ona eueu ae. Hana iho la o Kihapiilani i kana lau uala a haawe, hoi aku la i uka o Kalaniwai.

Ninau hou laua: “Heaha ka huakai nui a ke ’lii o ka hele ana mai?” Wahi a Kihapiilani: “He makaia no kuu kaikuaana no Piilani, o ia ka’u e imi nei.” Hai aku la ke ’lii o Kihapiilani i ka hana a kona kaikuaana. A lohe na elemakule, i aku la laua ia Kihapiilani: “Ua make ko kaikuaana, aole e ola; aia ka mea e make ai, o keia hale e hamama mai la ka puka i Waikapu.

The old men then asked him again: “What is the object of the chief’s journey to these parts?” Kihapiilani replied: “I am seeking for someone to kill my brother Piilani. That is the object of my search.” Kihapiilani then related the incident of the insult which caused Kihapiilani to seek revenge. When the old men heard this they said: “Your older brother is as good as dead; he shall not live. Go to that house whose door is opened toward Waikapu; there you will find our sister, Pao by name. Upon your arrival at the place she will direct you what to do next, then you will gain your object and your older brother will be at your mercy.” Kihapiilani agreed to follow out the advice of the old men and said: “I will go along home and plant my potato stalks: after that has been done, then I will carry out your instructions.”"
"[Olelo hoakaka: maloko o keia mele i haku ia, ua komo no ka moolelo o ko Maui mau alii, a ua pili no hoi ka haku ana i na ’lii o Maui.]",[A word is here necessary in reference to the composition of this mele. The history of the kings of Maui is mentioned in this chant and the composition of it was made solely for the Maui kings.]
"Ma keia kakau ana, e olelo hou ia ka olelo maanei no Kihapiilani. A pau ka olelo a na elemakule ia Kihapiilani, hoi aku la ia a hiki mauka o Kalaniwai, kanu iho la i kana mala uala.

A oo ka uala, haawi aku la ia i ka wahine, a me na makuahunowai.","We will now continue with the story of Kihapiilani. At the close of the conversation between the old men and Kihapiilani, he continued on his way to the uplands of Kalaniwai, where he began planting his potato stalks. For some time Kihapiilani devoted his whole time to the cultivation of his fields, until his season of want was finally passed, for he felt bitterly the shame and insult shown him by his wife’s parents when he was called a lazy fellow. When the potatoes were at last matured he turned them over to his wife and her parents."
"Maanei e maopopo ai ko Kihapiilani imi ana i makaia nona, e paio ai me kona kaikuaana lokoino, me Piilani.","We will now see how Kihapiilani made the search for the one to avenge the insult given him by his unkind brother, Piilani."
"Mahope o ka Kihapiilani olelo i ka wahine no ka mala uala, olelo aku la ia i kana wahine, penei: “E kuu wahine, e hele ana wau, haalele au ia oe, he nani ia, ua mahi iho la au i ka ai a oo, nau no e ai ka luhi o kaua.” I mai ka wahine: “O kou hele no keia hele loa, aole oe e hoi mai ana?” Ae aku la ke kane: “Ae, aole au e hoi mai, a kau, a hooilo; ina he manao kane kou, e noho kane ole oe a hoi mai au.” Ma keia mau olelo a Kihapiilani, aua loa iho la kana wahine, me ka ae ole e hele.

Ma keia mau olelo a Kihapiilani, maopopo i ka wahine he ’lii keia kane ana, he ’lii nui; alaila, pau kona manao ana i ka noho, ae aku la ia e hele o Kihapiilani.","After Kihapiilani had spoken to his wife relative to the field of potatoes, he said to her: “My wife, I am going away and shall leave you. I have labored patiently in the cultivation and care of these fields until they are ripened. You will eat the fruit of our labor.” The wife replied: “Are you going away for good, then, and are you not coming back again?” The husband replied: “Yes, I am not coming back for [ ] a summer and a winter. If you have husband-regard, remain husbandless until my return.” When the wife heard this she held Kihapiilani back and refused to allow him to go. Because of this stubbornness on his wife’s part he told her everything concerning himself in order to overcome her opposition, so he said: “My wife, I am now going to reveal certain things to you which you must not repeat, and I also urge upon you not to reveal my name. I am Kihapiilani; I am going in search of some one who will kill my brother Lonoapii (Piilani).” When the wife heard this she then knew that her husband was Kihapiilani, the great chief; and she also knew that it was beyond her to withhold him from going, so she consented for him to go on his way."
"Maanei e hoomaopopo ai kakou i ko Piikea mau hoahanau; o ka mua o Piilani, he kane ia, o kona muli o Piikea (nona keia olelo ana); o Kihapiilani kona muli iho, he kane, o Kalaniapiilani kona muli iho he kane no, ua make mua nae ia.

The first-born of the family was Piilani, a boy; the one following after him was Piikea whom we have already been introduced to as the wife of Umi. Following her was Kihapiilani, another boy; and the last of the family was Kalanipiilani, also a boy, who died young. Piilani was the heir to the kingdom of Maui, while his younger brother and sister, Kihapiilani and Piikea, were placed under him. This was the expressed will of Piilani to them, but Piilani disregarded the words of their father."

While Kihapiilani was yet on the road, on his way to meet her, she predicted to those around her, saying: “There is a chief on the way here in search for some one to help him in his revenge.”"
"A hiki o Kihapiilani i mua o Pao, ku iho la ke anuenue ia wa hookahi. Pane mai la o Pao: “Mama kuu haku.” Aloha aku la o Pao, aloha mai la o Kihapiilani, a pau ke aloha, hookipa aku la o Pao ia Kihapiilani.

Pao then said: “My lord is swift of foot.” She then greeted Kihapiilani. Kihapiilani returned the greeting. After the greetings had been exchanged, Pao invited Kihapiilani to come in, and then she asked him: “What brings my lord here on this hot day?” The chief replied: “I have come in search of someone who will cause the death of my brother Piilani, for he has treated me shamefully.” Pao then replied: “There in the lowlands of Kalepolepo lives the one who will assist you in killing your enemy. You go down till you reach Kalepolepo and look for a man whose face is covered over with filth. He is the one.” At the close of the directions of Pao, Kihapiilani proceeded on his way to Kalepolepo, where in time he found the man described to him and he went up to meet him. As he was approaching the man, the man saw him and said: “What is the object of the chief’s journey that has brought him here?” The chief, Kihapiilani, then said: “I have come to your presence by the direction of the prophetess Pao, for she told me that you have the means of fulfilling my desire, that is, something that will aid me in killing my brother Piilani, the one who has shamelessly abused me.”"

When the preparation was complete, Kihapiilani boarded the canoe and they set sail for Hawaii, to meet his sister Piikea and his brother-in-law Umi. That same evening they landed at Waipio. As soon as they landed, Kihapiilani proceeded to the house where Piikea was living and entered it. When his sister saw him, she sprang on him and wept. At the end of their weeping Piikea asked: “How are you getting along with your brother?” Kihapiilani answered his sister, saying: “We do not get along at all; my brother ill-treats me; he gets angry, abuses me, and has no love for me. That is why I have come to you, to tell you of these things.” When Piikea heard this, she cried in a loud voice, recounting their life in their early days while living with their parents and of their childhood wanderings here and there, carefree and happy. While Piikea was wailing, Umi, who was in another house, heard it and he wondered why his wife was crying; but after a while he was told that it was because his brother-in-law, Kihapiilani had arrived. Soon after [ ] this Piikea came out of her house, still crying in a loud voice, and began disrobing and acting the part of one bereft of her mind. In doing this, Piikea was but acting her part; she had her senses about her all right enough, but she did this to impress on her husband Umi that a very great wrong had been committed, to rouse him to action."
"A pau ka Piikea uwe ana, ninau mai la o Umi: “Heaha kou mea i uwe ai me ka leo nui, a me kou kuu ana i kou wahi hilahila?” I aku o Piikea: “No ka nui o ko’u aloha i ko’u kaikunane; akahi no maua a halawai kino, a no ko’u lohe ana mai nei i ka hana ino o kona kaikuaana, o Piilani, ia ia; nolaila, nui ko’u aloha, a o ia ke kumu o ko’u kuu ana i ko’u mai nona.

Ia wa, olelo aku la o Umi i kona mau hoakuka kaua, oia o Omaokamau, Piimaiwaa, Koi, e hoomakaukau i na waa, no ka holo i Maui e kaua ai me Piilani.","At the end of the wailing, Umi came up to her and asked her: “What is it that has made you cry out so loud and why have you disrobed yourself?” Piikea answered: “Because of the great love I bear my brother; this is the first time that we have met after such a long separation; and also because I am grieved at the ill-treatment given him by his brother Piilani. Because of this treatment I became so worked up that I wanted to show my great grief. We must therefore go and make war on Piilani.” When Umi heard this, he said: “I don’t think it proper for us to go and make war on Piilani, because he is your own brother; he is not connected to you from a distance, a mere relative.” Piikea said: “If you will not give your consent to my request, to go and make war on Piilani, then it would be far better for me to die than to live.” At this, Umi decided that he must obey his wife’s demand and so he gave his consent. Umi then summoned his war counselors, Omaokamau, Piimaiwaa and Koi, and gave them orders to prepare the fleet of war canoes for a trip to Maui to make war on Piilani."
"Aohe makau o keia mau kanaka ekolu, ua aa lakou e holo i Maui e kaua ai, aka, o ke ’lii o Umi, ua hopohopo ia no Imaikalani, no ka mea, he kanaka akamai loa ia i ke koa, ka oo ihe, a he kanaka ikaika loa, oia ko oi ma Maui, i loko o ia kau, a o ke kela ia mai Hawaii a Niihau.","These three men were undaunted; they did not hesitate, but immediately set out to obey the order of their king, for they were anxious to go to Maui to do battle, although Umi was doubtful about mastering Imaikalani, for he was a very skilful warrior and was well versed in all the arts of warfare, and especially in spear throwing. He was a very powerful man, and he was the greatest man in all of Maui at that time, and he was credited as being the strongest man from Hawaii to Niihau."
"Ia wa, ui ae o Umi i kana kahuna akamai, kaulana, oia o Kaoleioku: “Pehea keia holo i Maui e kaua me Piilani?” I aku o Kaoleioku: “E ke ’lii e, e holo no oe e kaua ia Maui, aole alii nana oe e kaua mai; he kaua na ka makaainana, pio no ia oe, aole e eha ka ili.”","When the preparations were about completed, Umi questioned his great and famous priest, Kaoleioku, saying: “How about this voyage to Maui to fight Piilani?” Kaoleioku said: “Chief, you may go and make war on Maui, for there is no king to oppose you; it is going to be a war of the common people; you will surely win, and, furthermore, your skin will not be bruised.”"
"A lohe o Umi i keia mau olelo a kona kahuna mana, a Kaoleioku, oluolu iho la ia.

He then ordered his chiefs who had charge of the different districts, to get the fleet of war canoes in readiness and to get the men under them ready and to all come together in one place. After several tens of days passed they finally reported that the canoes and men were ready to start out. It was said that the men were so numerous that they could not be counted."
"A makaukau na waa, holo mai la lakou mai Waipio mai a pae ma Kapueokahi i Maui. Ma keia holo ana o na waa, ua komo ka maka mua o na waa ma Kapueokahi ma Hana, Maui, a o ka maka hope o na waa, ma ke awa o Waipio i Hawaii. [ ]","As soon as the preparations were perfected, the canoes left Waipio and set sail for Maui, landing at Kapueokahi. On this expedition, while the first of the canoes were entering the harbor of Kapueokahi the last of the fleet was still in the harbor at Waipio, Hawaii. [ ]"
"I ka hiki ana o na waa ma Kapueokahi i Maui, ike mai la na kamaaina i ka lehulehu o na waa, makau iho la lakou.

He keiki nae kana o Kalaninuikupuapaikalaninui, ia ia o Maui ia wa.","When the people of Maui saw the great fleet of canoes coming into the harbor at Kapueokahi they were sore afraid. Shortly after this word was received and passed from place to place that it was Umi and his wife Piikea come to make war on Piilani. Piilani, however, was dead at this time, but he had a son by the name of Kalaninuikupuapaikalaninui, who was the king of Maui at this time."
"A lohe na kamaaina a pau o Hana, holo aku la lakou i luna o ka puu o Kauiki e noho ai. I aku o Umi ia Piikea kana wahine, aole make kaua, no ka mea, ua make o Piilani.

Ia manawa kena o Umi i kona mau koa kaulana, oia o Omaokamau, Piimaiwaa, Koi, e hele e kaua ma ka puu kaua o Kauiki.","When the people of Hana heard that the canoes were on a war expedition they all ran to the top of the Kauiki hill and stayed there. Umi said to Piikea, his wife: “Let us not make war on Maui as Piilani is already dead.” The reason why Umi did not wish to make war was because he took pity on the son born of Piilani, for Umi thought that it would be proper for the young man to have charge of the kingdom, and that Piikea and Kihapiilani be the parents, but Piikea stubbornly refused to have anything of the kind; she wanted to make war until the son of Piilani was killed, because she reasoned that if this young man was allowed to live there would be more fighting in the future. When Umi saw that it was useless to try to change his wife’s mind, he ordered his three chief officers, Omaokamau, Piimaiwaa and Koi to go and make war on the stronghold of Kauiki."

To the top of this hill a ladder was built on one side, a sort of small bridge made so as to entrap those trying to take the hill, that if those from below were to climb up in attack stones would be rolled down on them, thereby injuring them. Furthermore, a large wooden image was hewed out and made to stand at night, and served the purpose of a guard. The image was called Kawalakii, and this great statue kept the warriors below from climbing the hill at night."

O ke kowa ma waena o Omaokamau a me ua kanaka ala, elua haneri me kanaha kapuai ka loa.","Omaokamau was the first of Umi’s men who attempted to climb the Kauiki hill. When he came up to the place where the ladder could be seen he saw that a three-cornered rock was fastened at its top. When let go the rock would roll directly down, which would kill the person attempting to go up the ladder. Therefore Omaokamau became afraid and gave up the idea of climbing the ladder, so he thought deeply of a plan to accomplish this, but without success. After thinking for some time he decided that a night attempt to ascend the hill would be the best. When it became quite dark Omaokamau rose and went up to the point where he could distinctly see the ladder; when he arrived at the place he looked and saw a very large man, very tall, about eight feet, holding a long, large war club in his hand. The war club was longer and larger than the war club carried by himself. He also saw that the man had a loin [ ] cloth girded around his waist and drawn very tight. The distance between Omaokamau and the man was about 240 feet. When Omaokamau saw the man and the size of his war club fear and doubt entered his breast; he believed that if he was hit by that war club he would be knocked to pieces, so he was afraid to venture any further and decided to return."
"Ma keia ike ana o Omaokamau, komo mai ka makau a me ka hopohopo i loko ona no ka nui a me ka loihi o ka laau palau; e manao ia, ina e hahau ia ia, alaila, e [ ] kau liilii ia i ka laau palau; nolaila, makau o Omaokamau a hoi i lalo. A hiki o Omaokamau i lalo, ninau mai la ke ’lii o Umi: “Pehea kau pii ana aku nei i luna?” I aku o Omaokamau: “Pehea mai kau e ke ’lii. Ua ike aku nei au i kela kanaka, nui launa ole, aole kanaka ma Hawaii e like me kela kanaka; nui no a nui, loa no a loa, o kana laau palau loihi launa ole, ina e hahau mai he paki liilii loa ko ke kanaka i ka make.”","When Omaokamau reached the bottom of the hill Umi asked him: “How did you get along with your ascent of the hill?” Omaokamau answered: “Don’t think, O chief, that it will be possible for us to capture that hill. I have seen that man up on the hill; he is of incomparable size. There is no man in Hawaii like him; he is the largest of the largest, the tallest of the tallest, and his war club is the largest I have ever seen; if it should hit any one that person would be smashed to pieces.”"
"Maanei, e kuka kamailio iki kakou no keia kuhihewa o Omaokamau. He kii ka mea ana i kuhihewa ai, o Kawalakii. Ua akamai loa ka hana ana a ke ’lii o Maui i keia mea, a ua lilo ua kii la i ka po i kiai no ka puu o Kauiki, e malu ai i na enemi o lalo ke pii aku i ka po. A ua maluhia ka puu o Kauiki, i kona mau po e kiai ana me ka ike ole ia he kii; aka, i ka wa i ike ia ai, ua pio.","We will here speak of this mistaken idea of Omaokamau. The large man he saw was the wooden image, Kawalakii. The attempt of the king of Maui to frighten away the Hawaii warriors from a night attack was quite successful, for it proved a good watchman at night for the Kauiki hill, to guard against enemies if ascending at night. This hill of Kauiki was quite safe as long as the deception prevailed; but when it was at last discovered the hill was easily captured."
"A lohe o Umi i ka Omaokamau mau olelo akena, hoouna ae la ia ia Koi, e pii i luna o ka puu o Kauiki, a pii aku la o Koi i ka puu, hoaa wale aku la no a hoi mai la i ke ao.","When Umi heard the report of Omaokamau relating to the large man, he sent Koi to see if he could manage to get to the top of Kauiki hill. He made his climb in the day time, but after several attempts he returned and waited for the night."
"A po iho, pii hou o Koi, a hiki i kahi a Omaokamau i hoi mai ai, i nana aku kona hana, e ku mai ana keia kanaka nui, ua like me ka Omaokamau mea i olelo mua mai ai, ia lakou; nolaila makau iho la ia. Ua like ko Koi manao me ko Omaokamau manao e kuhi ana no he kanaka maoli, aohe manao he kii. Nolaila, hoi mai la o Koi a hiki i lalo i o Umi la, ninau mai la ke ’lii o Umi: “Pehea kau pii ana aku nei e Koi i luna o ka puu o Kauiki?” “E ke ’lii e, o ka manao kau he kanaka kela a kanaka; he oi kela o ka loihi, o ka nui, aole a’u kanaka i ike ai mai ko’u la i ike ai i ke kanaka a hiki i keia la; ua like me nei ke kino a me ka nui, he keu keia, he weliweli ke nana aku, a nolaila au i hoi mai la.”","At the approach of night Koi again made another attempt, but when he got as far as the place where Omaokamau saw the large man he went no further, for he, too, looked and saw the large man standing guard, just as Omaokamau had described to them; so he, too, became afraid and returned. Like Omaokamau, he thought that the man was real, never thinking that it was only an image. Koi therefore returned and when he arrived in the presence of Umi he was asked: “How did you make out when you climbed the hill?” “Say, O chief, don’t think that that man is an ordinary man; he is the tallest man I have ever seen, in size; I have not seen any one since I have been old enough to see a man that will equal him; this is the greatest, and he is terrible to behold; so I decided to come back.”"
"A pau ka Koi olelo ana ia Umi, no kona pii ana, alaila, he mea kaumaha loa ia i ko ke ’lii manao. Ia wa, olelo aku la ke ’lii o Umi ia Piimaiwaa, e pii i luna o ka puu o Kauiki.

Ia lakou e hailuku ana i na pohaku, ia wa o Piimaiwaa i olokaa ai i kana laau palau, ia Wahie. Ma keia hana a Piimaiwaa, aole oia i pa i na pohaku e iho makawalu mai ana ia ia, aka, ua hoomau no o Piimaiwaa i ka okaa i kana laau ia Wahie. Pela no kona hele koa ana a komo pono malalo o ka hulili mawaena o ka puu o Kauiki, kahi a ka lehulehu e nou mai ana i na pohaku.","At the close of Koi’s report to Umi relating to his climb, it was seen that Umi was sad at heart. After a time he ordered Piimaiwaa to ascend the hill of Kauiki. At the order Piimaiwaa rose and started on his expedition. When he reached the ladder he saw a large body of men there assembled all prepared with their implements [ ] of war, such as long spears, short spears, darts, war clubs, slings, pikoi, stones, sticks, and various other things. He also saw the three-cornered rock called the “moa.” When Piimaiwaa drew near to the men they began to throw stones at him. While the people were throwing stones at him he started to twirl his war club, Wahie, warding off the stones; he was not hit once, for he kept on twirling his club. He kept on advancing until he got right under the ladder which hung against the cliff, where the men who were stoning him were stationed."
"O ka hulili, he kanaono kapuai kona keikie, a malalo o laila o Piimaiwaa i ku ai me ka puke i kana laau palau, i ua hulili la. Ma keia ku ana o Piimaiwaa, ua hoomau mai kona mau enemi i ka hailuku i na pohaku ia ia, aka, aole ia i pa ike, no kona koa loa a me ka makau ole.","The ladder was about sixty feet long and it was at the foot of it that Piimaiwaa stood protecting himself with his club. By this stand of Piimaiwaa his enemies continued to hurl stones upon him without his being hit at all, on account of his great bravery and fearlessness. After standing there for some time he turned and ran down the hill at great speed and barely escaped from the many stones thrown at him."
"A liuliu kona ku ana ma laila, holo mai la oia mai laila mai, i lalo me ka mama loa, a pakele mahunehune mai la ia i na pohaku e iho makawalu mai ana i luna ona. A hiki oia i lalo i kahi o Umi e noho ana, ninau mai la o Umi: “Pehea kau pii ana aku nei?” Olelo mai la o Piimaiwaa: “Kahaha. Ua hele au a hiki i ka hulili, a paio pu me ka Ohiaokealakona.” Ma keia mau olelo a Piimaiwaa, ua nui ka poe i hooiaio mai. Ia Piimaiwaa i pii ai, ua ike ko lalo poe, i ka pii ana a komo malalo o ka hulili, a me kona holo ana mai me ka mama loa, mai laila mai. Aka, ua manao na mea a pau loa o lalo, ua make o Piimaiwaa, no ke komo ana i kahi haiki pilikia loa; aka, i ko lakou ike ana ia Piimaiwaa e holo mai ana, ua uwa lakou me ka olioli, no ke koa loa o Piimaiwaa, no ka mea, oia wale no ke koa i hele a komo i laila, aia hoi ma ia hulili elua mano kanaka ka nui, ua like me ewalu tausani ka nui. Ma keia hana ana a Piimaiwaa, ua oluolu loa ka manao o ke ’lii o Umi, a me na kanaka a pau loa o Hawaii.","When he arrived in the presence of Umi he was asked: “What about your climb?” Piimaiwaa replied: “Well, I went up as far as the ladder and there I encountered the men of Ohiaokealakona.” By this reply of Piimaiwaa, several men substantiated the statement, for the people from below saw him enter the pass leading to the foot of the ladder, and again when he came back running with great speed. But the people below all thought, when Piimaiwaa entered the pass, that he would be killed, for the place was very narrow and hard to go through; but when they saw Piimaiwaa return running they shouted with joy, for they realized the difficulties of the way and admired his fearlessness, and also because he was the only man who ever accomplished the feat of going as far as he did, for at this place there was stationed, at this time, about eight thousand men. In the performance of this difficult feat the king and the men from Hawaii were greatly pleased."
"I ka po ana iho, a poeleele, pii hou o Piimaiwaa e hakilo i ke kanaka nui, e olelo ia ana, me ko Piimaiwaa manao koa loa, e kaua no laua ina he kanaka. A hiki o Piimaiwaa i kahi a Omaokamau laua o Koi i ku mua ai, nana aku la ia, he kanaka nui io no e ku mai ana, kiekie no a kiekie, nui no a nui, loihi no a loihi ka laau palau.

When he reached the place where Omaokamau and Koi had stood he looked up and sure enough there was the large man, very tall, very large, and his club was the longest he had ever seen. When Piimaiwaa saw the man he began to study out a course of action for him to follow, and finally he decided to do this: that he would challenge the man to battle by the twirling of his war club, Wahie. This way of challenging was usually used, and the acceptance of the challenge was shown by the opponent by a return twirling of the war club. Piimaiwaa reasoned that in case the man should see him and strike at him he would be far enough away not to be touched by the club. Piimaiwaa then stepped up the ladder with firm feet, twirling his club all the while. After twirling his club on his right for some time he changed and twirled it on the left. After twirling the club on the left for some time, he looked at the man for some time studying what the man was going to do. Failing in seeing the man make any motion, he repeated the sign of the challenge, and still the man failed to make any motion. Piimaiwaa therefore concluded that the man knew nothing of [ ] the use of the war club, and that he was just holding it to strike at Piimaiwaa when he got near enough, and that the man was not taught to ward off the blow with the use of the club. When he saw this he said to himself: “If that is the case I shall kill you immediately.”"
"Alaila, hele aku la o Piimaiwaa me ka makau ole, a hiki i ka hua o ka laau palau a ua kii nei, mai laila aku a waenakonu a hiki loa i ke ku ana o ua kii nei. Alaila, ku iho la ia i laila, a hooponopono aku la i kana laau palau e hou i ke kii, ma keia hou ana, ua loaa ua kii nei, a koele ana ka laau palau. Pela no kana hana ana a kokoke i kahi e ku ana, ike pono iho la ia he kii keia, aohe kanaka, alaila, pau kona makau a me ka pihoihoi. Lalau iho la ia i ua kii nei, a kulai aku la a hina i lalo, olokaa aku la i ka pali, a haule i lalo o ka pali o Kapueokahi. A kahea aku la o Piimaiwaa i ka poe o lalo: “E lalo e, eia mai ke kii a kakou e kuhi nei he kanaka. Aohe kaua o luna nei, ua pau i ka hiamoe, ua hee ka puu o Kauiki.”","Piimaiwaa then advanced without fear until he reached the end of the man’s club. From this point he advanced further until he reached the middle of the club, then on until he reached the very man. Piimaiwaa then stood and prepared his club to poke at the man. He then tapped the man, a sign to give the man warning; when he did he heard a sound as of wood. He then approached the man and saw that it was only an image, and not a real man. This ended his excitement and fear. He then took the wooden image and threw it down, and rolled it over the cliff of Kapueokahi. Piimaiwaa then called to those below: “Say, you people there down below, here is the image that we have all this time taken for a real man. There is no fighting up here; the men are all asleep; the hill is captured.”"
"A lohe o Omaokamau a me Koi, i ko Piimaiwaa leo e hea ana mai luna mai o ka puu o Kauiki, pii aku la laua a hiki i luna. Mamua ae o ko laua hiki ana i luna o ka puu o Kauiki, e luku ana o Piimaiwaa i na kanaka a me na ’lii o luna; a hiki laua, hookahi na luku pu ana i na kanaka. Ma keia kaua ana, ua make, a ua hee ka puu o luna o Kauiki ia lakou, a ua make hoi ke ’lii o Maui, oia o Kalaninuikupuapaikalaninui. Ia wa, lilo ae la ka puu o Kauiki ia Umi. A make ke ’lii nui o Maui, koe iho la o Imaikalani, he ’lii no, he koa nae i makau ia e Umi, no kona akamai loa. [ ]","When Omaokamau and Koi heard the voice of Piimaiwaa calling from the top of the hill, they came and followed him up. Before they arrived on the top of the hill, however, Piimaiwaa had already begun the slaughter of the people and chiefs, and they joined therein. The king of Maui was already dead, and this fact gave Umi the control of the hill of Kauiki. This ended the battle, and Umi became possessed of the island of Maui, which he turned over to Kihapiilani and returned with Piikea his wife, and all his men, to Hawaii. [ ]"
"He alii nui o Lonoikamakahiki no ka mokupuni o Hawaii mahope iho o ko Keawenuiaumi make ana; he kanaonokumamaha hanauna mai a Wakea mai.

Keawenuiaumi was his father and Kaihalawai was his mother. Lonoikamakahiki was born at Napoopoo, and it was at this place that he was brought up by his retainers until he was full grown. His retainers were Hauna and Loli, and Kohenemonemo the wife of the two men."
"I ko Lonoikamakahiki wa opiopio, oiai ua hoomaka ae kona noonoo ana, ia manawa nana ae la o Lonoikamakahiki, e kau ana na mea lealea a kona makuakane he nui maloko o ka hale alii; a ike ae la oia e kau ana na ihe-pahee, nana loihi ae la oia, a liuliu, alaila, ninau aku la oia i kona mau kahu: “Heaha keia mau mea loloa e kau nei iluna o ka hale?” I aku la na kahu: “He ihe-pahee.” Ninau hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha kana waiwai?” Alaila hai aku la na kahu: “Elua mau kanaka e manao ana e lealea pili waiwai, alaila hele laua a ma ke kahua pahee; a i ka hiki ana malaila, alaila, olelo ka pili a holo, ina he mau waiwai ka pili, a i ole, he mau aina paha; a ina aole i pili ia ma ia mau waiwai, alaila, o ka pili no i na iwi ka pili, alaila pahee, ina he umikumamalima ka ai (ka helu).

If they do not wager these things, then they would put up other things, such as their bones, meaning their lives. After the bets are agreed on, they would then proceed to play the game of pahee. If the points to be scored in order to win the game be made fifteen, then the one who first obtains this number of points would win and the one with the lesser points would lose; then the winner takes the articles wagered, or whatever had been placed as wagers. Sometimes the articles of value would be so great that it would take three and four houses to hold them all. But if the things wagered be their bones, then death of course would be meted out to the loser. Wagering for bones was not made very often, only when the parties entered into the merits of their skill by long and spirited arguments, each claiming to be superior to the other. That is the use of those long things you see.”"
"A lohe o Lonoikamakahiki i keia mea, olelo ae la oia: “Aole ana waiwai; aka, he waiwai no, hookahi no hewa, o ka pili ana i na iwi ke hiki mai i ka manawa e hoopaapaa ai na mea pahee i ko laua mau ike, nolaila ka waiwai ole oia mea.” I aku la na kahu: “Oia iho la no ka waiwai oia mea (pahee) i malamaia ai e kou makuakane.” [ ]","When Lonoikamakahiki heard this explanation he replied: “Those things are worthless and have very little use; the great objection I have against them is that they are used by men for the purpose of making wagers, even to the extent of their bones, on the result of their skill after heated arguments. That is the reason they are [ ] worthless.” The retainers then said: “That is what the pahee spears are used for and the reason why they are being kept by your father.”"
"Ia manawa, nana hou ae la oia, a iki i ka olohu (ulu maika) ninau hou ae la oia: “Heaha kela mea?” Hai aku la no na kahu: “He olohu.” Ninau aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha hoi ka waiwai oia mea?” Alaila hai aku la no na kahu e like me ka olelo ana no ka ihe pahee. I hou aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “E kiola, aole ana waiwai.”","Lonoikamakahiki again looked up and saw a round, flat stone and again asked: “What is that thing?” The retainers replied: “It is called an olohu.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked: “What is it used for?” Then the retainers told him that it was used in the same way and for the same purpose as the pahee spears. At this Lonoikamakahiki replied: “Throw it away; it is also worthless.”"
"Nana hou ae la no ua o Lonoikamakahiki, a ike i ka pua kea, ninau hou aku la no i na kahu: “Heaha hoi kela?” Hai aku la na kahu: “He pua kea.” Ninau hou aku no ua o Lonoikamakahiki: “A pehea hoi kana hana?” Hai aku la no na kahu: “He mea lealea no ia; ina elua a ekolu paha mau mea e kea pua ana, a ina i lele ka kekahi a oi loa mamua o ka kekahi mau mea alaila, o ka eo ae la no ia.

If two or three fellows wish to play the game with the arrows they go to the playground and see who could glide his arrow on the ground the farthest. The one who can send it the farthest wins. If articles of value have been placed as wagers the winner takes them. It is used in the same way and for the same purpose as the pahee spears, and large wagers have been lost and won on the game.” Lonoikamakahiki then replied: “It, too, is worthless; you had better break it up and throw it away.”"
"Nana hou ae la no ua o Lonoikamakahiki, a ike ae la i ka laau palau, ninau ae la: “ Heaha hoi kela?” I aku na kahu: “He laau palau?” Ninau hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha kana hana?” Hai aku la na kahu: “He mea pepehi aku i na kanaka, ina paha he hoouka kaua mai ko kekahi aoao, a hoouka aku ko kekahi aoao, alaila o ka laau palau ka mea e luku aku ai.

If a battle is being fought with one side opposing the other then the war club comes in use as an implement of war. When this club is used in war it can kill as many as forty people, and sometimes it will kill more people than that.” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “That thing is also without value. Its only use would be for a stick to turn over the stones in an umu.”"
"Nana hou ae la no ua o Lonoikamakahiki, a o ke kau a ke kaula maa, ninau ae la: “Heaha ka waiwai o kela mau kaula e lewalewa mai nei?” Hai aku la na kahu: “He maa.” Ninau hou aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha hoi kona waiwai?” Hai aku la na kahu: “E hookomo i ka pohaku ma ka puka o ka maa, alaila, e pelu mai ina piko elua o ua maa la, a e hoopaa ae i ka piko o na kaula o ua maa la i ka poho o ka lima e makaukau [ ] ana i ka hana; alaila, e wili ae, a kowali ae, a e like me kona manawa i manao ai e hoolele aku i ka pohaku, alaila, e haalele loa aku i kekahi piko o ka maa, alaila e lele aku ka pohaku, he kanaha a oi aku na anana e lele ai, a ina i pa aku i ka pohaku, make loa kekahi kanaka.

Sometimes the stone would fly over forty fathoms, and if a person is struck with it the force would kill the person. It is, however, used as an implement of war.” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “That makes two things of value belonging to my father. Tie it up with the bundle of spears.” Lonoikamakahiki in this manner inquired into the use of all the things kept by his father. He denied the usefulness of everything but two, which two things he had the greatest desire to reserve for his own use."
"I kekahi manawa ae, hele aku la no o Lonoikamakahiki a ka hale i waiho ai na mea lealea, nana ae la, e kau ana no na mea ana i olelo ai i na kahu, e haihai a kiola; nolaila, hoi aku la oia a kona mau kahu, olelo aku la: “Kai noa, ua kiola olua i na mea a’u i olelo aku ai ia olua?” I aku la kona mau kahu: “Aole e hiki ia maua ke kiola i na mea a ko makuakane; make mai paha maua, no ka mea, o ka laau palau a ko makuakane, he laau hai kanaka ia.” A no ka paakiki loa o Lonoikamakahiki, nolaila, hele aku la na kahu, a hai aku la ia Keawenuiaumi, i keia mau hana a kana keiki.","Sometime after this, Lonoikamakahiki again visited the house where the different implements of war and games were kept, and again looked and saw the things he had ordered to be broken and destroyed still hanging in their respective places, so he returned and asked of his retainers: “I thought you two had destroyed those things that I told you to.” His two retainers answered him saying: “We cannot destroy the things belonging to your father, for he would consider it a matter sufficient to cause our death, because the war club is one of the things highly valued by your father, for it has been used in his great battles, and it has been the means of killing many of his enemies.” Lonoikamakahiki becoming very stubborn in the matter, the retainers therefore went to Keawenuiaumi and reported to him the wish of his son."
"Ia manawa, lohe ae la o Keawenuiaumi, alaila, haohao iho la oia i keia hana kupanaha a kana keiki; nolaila, hele aku la oia e ninau maopopo ia Lonoikamakahiki i ke kumu o ko ke keiki manao ana pela. Nolaila i ka hiki ana aku o Keawenuiaumi i kahi i hanai ia ai e na kahu, aia nae ua o Lonoikamakahiki i ka hooholowaa me kekahi mau kahu ona. A hoi mai la ua o Lonoikamakahiki, e noho aku ana o Keawenuiaumi, hele mai la ke keiki a noho iho la i luna o na uha o ka makuakane; alaila, i mea e maopopo ai ia Keawenuiaumi ko Lonoikamakahiki manao, nolaila, lawe ae la kona makuakane iaia i kahi i waiho ai na mea lealea. A hiki aku la laua, me na kahu pu ma ka hale i waiho ai na mea lealea, ninau aku la o Keawenuiaumi: “Heaha kou manao no neia mau mea (na mea lealea ame na mea kaua) e kau nei?” I ae la ke keiki (Lonoikamakahiki): “Aole he waiwai iki o keia mau mea, ua olelo aku wau ia laua ’la (Hauna ame Loli) e kiola keia mau mea a pau, a o ka ihe kaua ame ka maa na mea waiwai.” I aku la o Keawenuiaumi: “Aole pela ko’u manao, aia no a hiki i kou noho aimoku ana, alaila, nau no e kiola, ke ike aku la oe, he mea waiwai ole kela.”","When Keawenuiaumi heard this report he was greatly surprised because of the strange wish expressed by his son. He therefore sought out Lonoikamakahiki with the intention of asking him why he wished to have these things destroyed. When Keawenuiaumi came to the place where the boy was being cared for by the retainers, he found that Lonoikamakahiki was out canoe sailing with some of his other retainers. When Lonoikamakahiki returned Keawenuiaumi was waiting for him; the boy then went up to the father and sat on his lap. In order to have the matter understood by his son properly Keawenuiaumi took Lonoikamakahiki to the house where the different implements of war and games were kept, and there the father asked the son: “What do you think of these things?” meaning the implements of war and games hanging on the wall. The son replied: “These things are of no value or use. I have told those two (Hauna and Loli) to destroy them all, but to keep the bundle of spears and the sling, for they are of value.” Keawenuiaumi then said to the boy: “That is not what I think about those things. When the time comes for you to assume the care of the whole island, then you will be in a position to do as you like; you can then throw these things away if you see no use in retaining them.”"
"Ma ia hope mai, nalu wale iho la no o Keawenuiaumi i ka hope o keia keiki ke nui ae. I iho a ka makuakane: “Ane kipi wale aku no koe o keia keiki ma kona noho ai aina ana, a heaha la ka hana a keia alii ke kanaka makua aku.” [ ]","After this incident Keawenuiaumi for some time thought over the future of the boy and wondered what would become of him after he had grown up. The father said [ ] to himself: “It looks as though the boy will some day go contrary to all the laws that have heretofore governed the apportioning of lands, and I wonder what this chief will do after he has grown up.”"
"I kekahi manawa ma ia hope mai, komo ae la ua o Lonoikamakahiki i loko o ka heiau me kona mau kahu, a ike aku la i na kii e ku mai ana ma kuono o ka heiau, ninau aku la i na kahu: “Owai kela mau kanaka e ku mai la i loko o ka pa?” I aku la na makua a me na kahu: “Aole ia he kanaka, he akua ia o ko makou mau makua, na kupuna hoi ou.” A lohe o Lonoikamakahiki he akua ia mau kii, alaila puliki ikaika aku la i na makua, no ka mea, ua makau o Lonoikamakahiki, a no ka mea hoi, ua lohe mua oia i ka hoomakaukauia e na hoa paani ona, a nolaila oia i puliki paa ai i na makua, no kona manao o pau mai i ke akua, no ka mea, ua oleloia e kona mau hoa kamalii: “E lono-e!

Oia ka waiwai o ke akua i malama ia ai.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki ia Keawenuiaumi: “Akolu wale no au mea waiwai i malama ai; o keia mau mea au ka’u e malama.”","Sometime after this Lonoikamakahiki entered the temple with his retainers and there saw the images standing up in one of the corners, when he asked of his retainers: “Who are those persons standing there within the wall?” His parents and retainers replied: “They are not persons; they are the gods of our parents, your grandparents.” When Lonoikamakahiki heard that the images were gods he was sore afraid and held on to his parents with all his strength, for he had been told by his playmates that ghosts were things to be avoided and feared, and he thought the images were the ghosts. Because Lonoikamakahiki held on to his parents they said to him: “You must not be afraid; what you see are not ghosts; they are the gods who own this place.” Lonoikamakahiki then asked of his parents: “What are they good for?” The parents made reply: “The reason why they are kept is this: If in case of battle one is taken captive or defeated, they offer a prayer to the gods, and then the gods will direct the person to safety. If, on the other hand, a canoe is capsized out in mid-ocean, prayers are offered to the gods and those in the canoe will be saved. If a season of famine should come, prayers are offered to the gods and the food would again appear out of the earth. These are some of the benefits why a god should be kept.” Lonoikamakahiki then said to his father, Keawenuiaumi: “That makes three things in your keeping that are of value. I will take care of these things.”"

Aka, ma ka mokomoko, oia ka oihana i oi aku ko Lonoikamakahiki ike ame ke akamai maoli.","Sometime after Lonoikamakahiki had outgrown his childhood days and had almost attained manhood, he began to learn the art of dodging and throwing the spear; he also learned how to box and wrestle. These things were in time mastered by him. When he became proficient in these arts of defense and of war, the teachers who had charge of his training in these matters then held the last customary ceremonies, as a sign of foretelling how he would act in life. The signs were favorable in all the different arts with one exception, that of boxing, which, not being favorable in this one thing, he was advised to eliminate this one art from the list of those he was to participate in. In other words, he was forbidden from ever going into any boxing contest. Because of this Lonoikamakahiki relinquished his claims as a boxer. It was in the art of wrestling, however, that Lonoikamakahiki proved himself to be the most proficient."
"I ko Lonoikamakahiki wa i hoonaauao loa ae ai, makemake ae la oia e ike maopopo i na hana oi o ka waiwai, a nolaila, hoao pakahi aku la oia i na hana lealea, ame na hana kaua a kona makuakane, na hana hoi ana i olelo ai i kona mau kahu, he mau hana waiwai ole. [ ]","When Lonoikamakahiki became older and more matured in thought he expressed a desire to know the things that would be of the most use to him, especially in the games, so he tried each one of them, as well as the different arts of warfare indulged in by his father, the things that were told him by his retainers as the things most desired. [ ]"
"A i ko Lonoikamakahiki hoao ana, maopopo iho la no he waiwai ole ia mau mea, a e like hoi me kana olelo mua, o ka alo ihe ame ka oo ihe, ka maa ame ka malama i ke akua na hana waiwai.

The thrust and dodging spear, the sling, and the care of the god, however, were of value. He therefore made a visit around the island of Hawaii accompanied by his parents and retainers."
"O Hauna nae ame kona kaikaina me Loli, na kahu hoi o ua o Lonoikamakahiki, he mau kaula laua, he mau kanaka haipule hoi, a ua oleloia he mau kanaka mana laua, a he hiki ia laua ke hana i na hana mana he nui ma ka inoa o ko Keawenuiaumi akua, ame ko laua akua hoi.","Hauna and his younger brother Loli, the personal attendants or retainers of Lonoikamakahiki, were prophets; they were men who paid attention strictly to the laws of the gods, and it was said that they were men who possessed supernatural powers, and that they were able to perform many miracles in the name of the god of Keawenuiaumi, and also in the name of their own god."
"Ma keia kaapuni ana o Lonoikamakahiki me kona mau makua, a hiki ma Hilo, a noho iho la ma Kanokapa, kahi e pili pu ana me ka nuku o ka muliwai o Wailuku. E noho ana o Kawaamaukele malaila, he kahuna kakaolelo nui, ua elemakule oia, a poohina no hoi.

He was a very old man, his head was wholly gray."
"A ike aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i ua elemakule nei, oiai e noho pu ana oia me kona mau kahu. Ninau malu aku la: “He akua anei kela elemakule lauoho loloa?” I aku la na kahu: “Aole he akua, he kanaka no, he kakaolelo nae, he kahuna nui oia ma na oihana kahuna apau.” Ninau hou aku la ua o Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha ka waiwai a ia elemakule?” I aku na kahu: “O ke kanaka ike i ke kakaolelo, he kanaka nui ia imua o ke alo alii; he kanaka akamai i ka olelo, ma kana olelo e olelo ai, malaila ke alii e hoolohe ai; nana e ike ka pomaikai o ka aina ame ke kanaka, he hiki i kela kanaka ke iki mai i ke kanaka waiwai ame ka waiwai ole, ke alii waiwai ame ka waiwai ole.”","When Lonoikamakahiki saw the old man he was greatly surprised, because this man was the only man that differed from the rest of the men that came in the presence of Keawenuiaumi; his hair was so long that it reached below his waist, a thing common with the high priests, however. When Lonoikamakahiki, who was sitting with his attendants, had looked at the old man for some time he asked: “Is that old man with the long hair a god?” The attendants replied: “He is not a god; he is a human being, but not of the ordinary kind; he is a counselor. He is also the high priest, higher than all the others.” Again Lonoikamakahiki asked: “What is the old man good for?” The attendants replied: “The man who is a counselor is a very great man in the court of the king; he must be a man who is skilful in language, and whatever advice he gives the king, the king will take heed. He can predict the coming of prosperity to the land and the people. That man can tell whether a common person will become rich or poor, or the chief who will become wealthy or not.”"
"A no keia mea hoouna aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i kekahi kahu ona e kii i ke kakaolelo ia Kawaamaukele. A hiki mai la i mua o Keawenuiaumi me Lonoikamakahiki, i aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “I kiiia aku nei oe no ko’u lohe ana he elemakule akamai oe i ka ike mai i ke alii waiwai ame ka waiwai ole; nolaila, e nana mai oe ia’u, malia paha he alii ilihune wau ma keia manawa aku, a e hai mai oe i ka’u mau hana [ ] ma keia hope aku.” I mai o Kawaamaukele: “He alii waiwai no oe i kekahi manawa, aia a hike aku i kou wa kanaka makua, alaila, ilihune oe aole ou kanaka, aka, he alii koa oe.” I hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “I aha ka’u hana e hana ai i waiwai ai?

When he came in the presence of Keawenuiaumi and Lonoikamakahiki, Lonoikamakahiki spoke up saying: “You have been requested to come here because I have been told that you are an old man who is learned in the things of the future and can tell whether a chief will become rich or poor; therefore I want you to make an examination of me and tell me what I am to be in the future.” [ ] Kawaamaukele then replied: “You are going to be a wealthy chief at times, but when you reach maturity then you will become poor, in that you will be without followers; but you are going to be a brave chief.” Lonoikamakahiki then again asked him: “What profession shall I take up in order that I may become wealthy? If you know what I can take up that will be profitable as a profession, then we will take it up and you instruct me in its detail.” The priest paused for a while, thinking of what Lonoikamakahiki had asked, and then replied: “The professions that will make you famous all over the islands are that of a counselor and hoopapa. If you can be an expert in this profession of hoopapa, then you will become wealthy.” Lonoikamakahiki took to heart every word spoken by the high priest."
"Mahope iho oia manawa, ao ae la oia i ka oihana hoopapa ma ka aoao kakaolelo, a naauao oia ma ia hana, a oia ka oihana i kaulana nui ai o Lonoikamakahiki a puni na moku, o ke kolu no hoi ia o ka Lonoikamakahiki mau hana akamai a hiki i kona make ana; a nui loa ka pilikia o kekahi poe alii iaia.","Sometime after this the profession of hoopapa was taken up by Lonoikamakahiki and he was educated into the different things of the profession pertaining to that portion relating to language, and after he had mastered it he in later years did become famous all over the islands. This made the third thing that Lonoikamakahiki became proficient in up to the time of his death, and he caused no end of trouble for certain chiefs."
"Mahope mai o kona ao ana i ka oihana hoopapa ma Hilo, hoi aku la oia me kona mau makua a noho ma Napoopoo, a hoomaka aku la oia i ka hoopapa me na hoa paani ona, a lilo iho la ka hana hoopapa i mea makemake nui na Lonoikamakahiki a pau ka la, a pela aku. Aka, o Lonoikamakahiki, ua hoolawehala wale aku oia i kona mau hoa paani, i mea e hoopapa ai, he mea e hoao ai i kana oihana hoopapa. O na puulu kamalii a pau o Kealakekua, ua hoopapa mau ia e Lonoikamakahiki, aka nae, aole i ike o Lonoikamakahiki i kona akamai ma ia hana hope ana i ao ai, aka, o ka mea nana i ao aku, ua ike aku oia i ke akamai ma ka hoopapa ana.","After completing the study of hoopapa in Hilo he returned with his parents to Napoopoo, where they took up their residence and he immediately practiced his profession on his playmates, and in this manner he made practical use of it. In this way the profession of hoopapa became a favorite thing with him, making use of it day after day. After a time, however, Lonoikamakahiki began to ensnare his playmates by getting into argument with them in order to test his profession of wrangling. All the crowds of children in Kealakekua were taken up by Lonoikamakahiki and defeated. In thus making practical tests of his vocation Lonoikamakahiki, although making great headway, was at the same time unaware of his advance in his profession; but the person who had charge of his education was well aware of his skill in argument."
"Ma ko Lonoikamakahiki mau la hookanaka makua, lawe ae la oia i kona kaikuahine ia Kaikilani i wahine nana.

Ia ike ana o Kanaloakuaana me Kaikilani, loaa o Kalanioumi ame Kealiiokalani, he mau kaikamahine laua, a o Keakealani, ke keikikane.","When Lonoikamakahiki grew to the age of maturity he took unto himself his cousin Kaikilani to be his wife. During the early part of their married life they lived in peace and happiness, and nothing occurred between them to cause any dissatisfaction. During all the time that they lived as man and wife they did not have issue; but Kaikilani had three children with Kanaloakuaana, an uncle of Kaikilani’s. When Kanaloakuaana took Kaikilani to be his wife their issue was Kalanioumi and Kealiiokalani, who were girls, and Keakealani, a boy."
"Mamua o ko Keawenuiaumi make ana, kauoha ae la oia ia Lonoikamakahiki e noho ma ka noho alii, aka, aole pela ko Lonoikamakahiki manao.

[ ]","Before Keawenuiaumi died he requested Lonoikamakahiki to take the head of the government, but Lonoikamakahiki did not think it proper to do so. What Lonoikamakahiki told his father was, that he did not wish to take charge of the affairs of state at that time, but to defer the time until he was able to master the arts of warfare, when he could become expert therein; then he would take charge. Because of this, Keawenuiaumi left the whole island of Hawaii in the care of Kaikilani. After the death of Keawenuiaumi, Kaikilani took charge of the government. She was the first chiefess who became the ruler of the land. [ ]"
"Ma ia hope mai o ko Kaikilani ai moku ana, kaapuni ae la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Hawaii a puni, e hoiki ana i kona ike ma na mea ana i ao ai o ka oihana kaua, a lanakila ae ia oia ma ia mau hana.

Alaila hoao hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki no na ihe elua i ka manawa hookahi, a ua akamai no oia i ka alo ana no ia mau ihe.","After Kaikilani had assumed the care of the government, Lonoikamakahiki made a circuit of the island of Hawaii making public competitions in all the different arts of warfare mastered by him, in which he was always victorious. Word of these accomplishments of Lonoikamakahiki was in time carried to the hearing of Kanaloakuaana. When Lonoikamakahiki arrived home after making this circuit, he competed in boxing against Kanaloakuaana, for he, too, was skilful in all the arts of warfare. Kanaloakuaana did not demand this competition for any other purpose than to test for himself how proficient Lonoikamakahiki was, therefore they tried at boxing and Kanaloakuaana found that he was skilful. Kanaloakuaana then took up spear throwing as the next thing. At this Lonoikamakahiki said: “I have not studied the art of spear throwing; but what I have mastered is the art of dodging the spear.” Kanaloakuaana therefore took him at his word and did the throwing while Lonoikamakahiki did the dodging. In this trial Kanaloakuaana was satisfied that Lonoikamakahiki was indeed master of this art. The dodging of two spears at once was next taken up and again he proved himself to be proficient."
"A ike aku la o Kanaloakuaana ua akamai o Lonoikamakahiki, alaila, hoao ae la no laua no na ihe eha e hou i ka manawa hookahi, aka, he mea ole ia ia Lonoikamakahiki; a pela no ka laua hoao ana a hiki i na ihe he umi.

This trial was continued until they reached ten spears. When this number of spears was reached Kanaloakuaana was certain that Lonoikamakahiki was master of more than ten spears, so he concluded to make further trials, the dodging of any number of spears at once."
"A i mea e maopopo ai ia Kanaloakuaana ke akamai o Lonoikamakahiki ma ka oo ihe, lawe ae la oia ia Lonoikamakahiki ma Kailua, ma ke one o Kaiakekua. A hiki aku la malaila, ia manawa, olelo aku la o Kanaloakuaana ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua makemake au e ike i ko akamai loa, nolaila wau i lawe mai nei maanei e ike i kou akamai, no ka mea, ua hoao kaua i ka oo ihe ma ka ihe hookahi a hiki i ka umi, ua ike au i kou akamai ma ia mau ihe, aka, hookahi mea i koe ia oe, o ka alo ana iloko o ke olowalu ihe, ina e akamai oe ma ia mau mea, alaila akamai io oe.”","In order to make this further trial Kanaloakuaana took Lonoikamakahiki to Kailua, to the sandy beach at Kaiakekua. When they came to the place, Kanaloakuaana said to Lonoikamakahiki: “I want to be positive of your great skill, hence I have brought you here for that test and to satisfy myself that you are indeed a master. We have tested you from one to ten spears, and I am sure you are skilful in the dodging of that number. There is, however, one more trial—the dodging of any number of spears. If you are proficient in this, then you are indeed expert.”"
"A pau ka Kanaloakuaana olelo ana no keia mea, alaila ku mai la ka poe oo ihe ma ke alo mai a ma na aoao, koe kona kua, ua like paha me kanakolu ihe e hou i ka manawa hookahi. Aka ia hoao ana, aole i ku iki o Lonoikamakahiki ia mau ihe.

Pela no ka Kanaloakuaana hoao ana a pau na mea a Lonoikamakahiki i ao ai.","After Kanaloakuaana had spoken the above words, the people who were to throw the spears arose in front and on both sides of Lonoikamakahiki, leaving his back free. There were about thirty spearmen to throw at the same time. After the men were ready and the spears thrown it was seen that Lonoikamakahiki was not hit by a single one of them. Kanaloakuaana continued the test from thirty spears until the number had reached two times forty spears; still Lonoikamakahiki was not hit. The only time that Lonoikamakahiki was pricked was by himself with his own spear. The trials in the different arts were carried out in the most severe way until all the different arts were gone through."
"Mahope iho o ko Kanaloakuaana hoao ana ia Lonoikamakahiki, nolaila olelo aku la o Kanaloakuaana ia Kaikilani: “E hoihoi ka aina ia Lonoikamakahiki.” No ka mea ua maopopo ia Kanaloakuaana ke akamai ma na mea e pili ana i ke Aupuni.

Noho iho la o Lonoikamakahiki me kana wahine ma na aina apau o Hawaii, he mau poo no ke aupuni.","After Kanaloakuaana had put Lonoikamakahiki through all the different trials of skill in the various arts of warfare, Kanaloakuaana said to Kaikilani: “The care of the government must be given over to Lonoikamakahiki.” This was because Kanaloakuaana [ ] was satisfied that Lonoikamakahiki was well able to take charge of all things pertaining to the government. Because of this, Kanaloakuaana told Lonoikamakahiki to fill the vacancy left by Keawenuiaumi, so Lonoikamakahiki assumed control of the government. It was Lonoikamakahiki together with his wife, however, that took charge of all the lands of Hawaii, and the two were the head of the government."
"A liuliu ko Lonoikamakahiki noho alii ana, aole he kaua a kipi hoi ma ia hope mai, aole no hoi i kulanalana kona noho ana me kana wahine. Aka, o Kaikilani, oia o laua mea i hana i ka hewa, no ka mea, ua lawe ae oia ia Heakekoa ke keiki a Kalaulipali me Uli i kane moe kolohe nana, me ka ike ole o Lonoikamakahiki.","After Lonoikamakahiki had ruled for some time no dissatisfaction over his administration of the affairs of the government was shown; no wars in the nature of rebellions arose, and this peaceful reign lasted for some considerable time; neither was any family trouble seen. But Kaikilani, on the other hand, was the one who fell into sin, for she took Heakekoa, the son of Kalaulipali and Uli, as her paramour without the knowledge of Lonoikamakahiki."
"A i ka manawa i manao ai o Lonoikamakahiki e holo makaikai ia Maui a hiki i Kauai; nolaila, lawe ae la oia i kana wahine ia Kaikilani, e hele pu ma ia huakai hele a ke alii. A i ka manawa i makaukau ai o ka huakai a ke alii, lawe ae la oia i kona mau hoewaa, ame kona kahu me Loli.

Aia nae maloko o ua hokeo la na mea hoopapa a pau, na ukana o kela ano keia ano. A lawe ae la no hoi i kana kahili o Eleeleualani, he kahili nui ia.","After a time Lonoikamakahiki formed a desire to visit Maui and to go as far as Kauai; so he took his wife Kaikilani to accompany him on this trip. When everything pertaining to the king’s journey was ready he took his canoe men and his attendant, Loli. The chief desire that actuated Lonoikamakahiki to make this journey was that he might show his skill in his favorite profession of hoopapa. Because of this fact he took with him his calabash of clothes known by the name of Kuwalawala. In this calabash, besides his apparel, were several of the things which were used by him in the profession of hoopapa. Besides this calabash he took along with him his feather kahili, Eleeleualani. This was a very large kahili."
"A makaukau ka huakai a ke alii, alaila, holo aku la lakou a Maui, aole i liuliu ma Maui, alaila holo aku la ma Molokai, a ma Koolau ka lakou holo ana, a noho ma Kalaupapa. Ia kau ana o lakou nei malaila, aole i manao o Lonoikamakahiki e liuliu ka noho ana malaila, aka no ka loohia ana o lakou e ka makani ino, nolaila, liuliu ai lakou malaila, he mau malama paha eha. Ia manawa no a laua i noho ai ma Kalaupapa, he konane ka laua hana nui ia mau malama.","After everything was made ready the king and his companions set out and went as far as Maui. They did not make a very lengthy stay in Maui and the king’s visit was continued to Molokai. The journey was taken to the Koolau side of the island and a stop was made at Kalaupapa. In making the stop at this place Lonoikamakahiki did not contemplate that they would remain very long, but because of the coming of a very severe storm they were detained at this place for about four months. While the royal party was sojourning at Kalaupapa the two whiled away most of their time playing the game of konane."
"I kela manawa hoi a ua o Lonoikamakahiki ma i haalele aku ai a holo mai ai i ka makaikai, ia manawa he mea nui loa ia no ko Heakekoa aloha no Kaikilani, a hiki ole ke hoomanawanui; nolaila, huli mai la o ua o Heakekoa mahope o Lonoikamakahiki ma.

Noho iho la o Heakekoa ma Kalae no kekahi mau la, me ke ake e loaa ka mea nana e lawe aku ka lohe ia Kaikilani, aka, aole he kanaka kupono.","At the time when Lonoikamakahiki and his party left on their journey of sightseeing, Heakekoa missed his lover Kaikilani so much that he was unable to remain in Hawaii; therefore he followed Lonoikamakahiki and his party. In following them up Heakekoa first called at Maui, and, failing to find them, he continued on to Molokai and landed at Kalae, where he was informed that the royal couple were staying at Kalaupapa. Heakekoa remained at Kalae for several days with the hope of securing someone who would carry the news of his arrival to Kaikilani, but he was unable to secure a proper person."
"I kekahi la, hiki mai la kekahi mau kanaka no Kalaupapa mai; a i ka wa i hoi ai kela poe ma Kalaupapa, nolaila ninau aku la ua o Heakekoa i na kanaka me ka i aku: “E hoi ana anei oukou i Kalaupapa?” Ae, mai la na kanaka.

When the time came for the men to make their return to Kalaupapa, Heakekoa inquired of them: “Are you people going back to Kalaupapa?” The men assented. Again Heakekoa asked: “Are not the chiefs of Hawaii staying there?” The men then told him positively, saying: “They are still there.” Heakekoa then said: “When you get to the [ ] edge of the cliff, on your return, just call out the following words: ‘Say, Kaikilani, Chiefess of Puna, love has been sent you by the shady cliff, of Uli of Hea.’ If she does not make answer, then call out again these words:"
"‘E Kaikilani alii wahine o Puna-e, E aa mai ana ko ipo ia oe, O ke ku a ka lauli pali o Uli o Heakekoa.’","‘Say, Kaikilani, Chiefess of Puna, Your lover sends you his love Of the shady cliff that stands, of Uli of Heakekoa.’"
"A lohe ae la lakou i keia olelo a Heakekoa, alaila, hoi aku la ua mau kanaka nei.

When the men came to the top of the Kalaupapa cliff, at a point called Kaomilani, they called out in the words instructed them by Heakekoa. At the first call Kaikilani heard it coming down from the cliff, and she then knew that her lover had arrived. At this time, however, when the call was heard by Kaikilani, she was engaged in a game of konane with her husband, but in order to distract the attention of her husband as to the meaning of the call from the cliff she made some informal remark, yet in connection with the game of konane, saying: “That is won; this is on the run, the space is long, the top is falling, the blacks are indistinct; the whites have won.”"
"A no ka manao o na kanaka nana i kahea aku aole i lohe o Kaikilani, nolaila, kahea hou aku la ua poe kanaka nei:","After making the calls and believing that they had not been heard by Kaikilani, the men repeated the call, saying:"
"Ia manawa, lohe ae la o Lonoikamakahiki, he kane o Heakekoa na Kaikilani, me ka manao no ua pae mai ma kekahi wahi o Molokai.","For once Lonoikamakahiki knew that Heakekoa was the lover of Kaikilani, and from the calls he also knew that the fellow had landed at some place on Molokai."
"Mahope iho o ka lohe ana o Lonoikamakahiki i keia leo, alaila, ninau aku oia i ka wahine kaikuahine ona: “E, aloha mai la nae hoi ko ipo ia oe o Heakekoa.” Aole nae he ekemu aku o Kaikilani, aka, ua lohe no i ka ninau mai a ke kane, hoolalau wale iho la no ua o Kaikilani: “O ke kui keia, a o ka holo kela, mau kawa, ninole ka luna, hapala ka ele, na ke kea ka ai.” Ia manawa, lalau aku la ua o Lonoikamakahiki i ka papa konane, a hahau aku la i ke poo o ka wahine, a eha aku la o Kaikilani, aka, ua koe no nae ke ola.","After Lonoikamakahiki had made out the calls, he then asked of his cousin, his wife: “Say! Your lover Heakekoa sends you his love, I hear.” Kaikilani did not make answer to the question put by her husband, however, but continued in her deception, by saying: “This here is won; that is on the run, steady progress, the top is falling, the blacks are indistinct; the whites have won.” At this, Lonoikamakahiki took up the konane board and struck his wife on the head, inflicting painful wounds, but not severe enough, however, to kill her."
"Nolaila, huhu nui loa iho la o Lonoikamakahiki, a pono ole kona manao, me ka manao e hoohiki, aole e launa hou me Kaikilani; aka, iloko wale iho no ia ona, aole i hoopuka ma ke akea, alaila, hoomaau ae la oia i kana wahine, a hookaawale aku la.

[ ]","Because of this, the anger of Lonoikamakahiki was aroused and his mind was greatly troubled; he then made an oath that he would never again live with Kaikilani. This oath, however, he maintained within himself, not voicing it to any one. He then put her aside and refused to have anything to do with her. Because of this Kaikilani returned to Hawaii without meeting Heakekoa again, Kaikilani promising herself to have nothing more to do with Heakekoa, knowing full well that if she did she would in all likelihood be killed by Lonoikamakahiki, her husband; therefore she made up her mind to renounce Heakekoa forever. [ ]"
"A no keia hana ana a Lonoikamakahiki i ka wahine, nolaila, ua kui aku ka lono a lohe o Kanaloakuaana, nolaila, manao ae la na ’lii o Hawaii e kipi aku ia Lonoikamakahiki.

When Kaikilani arrived on Hawaii, on her return from Molokai, she found that Kanaloakuaana together with the chiefs of Hawaii had placed guards at all the landing places of Hawaii. This was done by their orders, because they had heard that Kaikilani was almost killed by Lonoikamakahiki."
"Hoi loa aku la o Kaikilani a Napoopoo, ua hao ae la na ’lii apau o Hawaii e kipi ia Lonoikamakahiki. A no ia mea, he nui loa ko Kaikilani manao aloha no Lonoikamakahiki, no ka mea, aole he like o kona manao me ko Kanaloakuaana ma ame na ’lii e ae.

Ma ia imi ana a Kaikilani, ua hala aku o Lonoikamakahiki i Oahu.","On this return Kaikilani proceeded to Napoopoo and there found that all the chiefs of Hawaii had taken everything for themselves and were in open revolt against Lonoikamakahiki. Upon seeing this, Kaikilani’s love for Lonoikamakahiki returned and she took pity on him, and was not in sympathy with the wish of Kanaloakuaana and the other chiefs. Because of this Kaikilani began to entertain a desire to go back and make a search for Lonoikamakahiki to inform him of the open revolt of the chiefs of Hawaii. On this return of Kaikilani, Lonoikamakahiki had in the meantime continued on his journey and was on Oahu."
"Mahope iho o ko Kaikilani hoi ana i Hawaii mai Molokai aku, alaila, ma ka pau ana o na la ino, kupono no ka holo moana, alaila holo aku la o Lonoikamakahiki mai Kalaupapa aku, a pae ma Kailua i Koolaupoko ma Oahu.","After Kaikilani’s return to Hawaii from Molokai, and the inclement weather had ceased, making the ocean fit for traveling, then Lonoikamakahiki set sail from Kalaupapa for Oahu, landing at Kailua in Koolaupoko. Upon the arrival of Lonoikamakahiki he found that Kakuhihewa was living at Kailua, residing at his palace."
"Ia hiki ana aku o Lonoikamakahiki, aia no o Kakuhihewa malaila kahi i noho ai, maloko o kona hale alii. I ka wa e holo aku ana o Lonoikamakahiki, ike mua aku la no o Lanahuimihaku ma i na waa o Keawenuiaumi, alaila, olelo aku la ia Kakuhihewa: “O ke alii o Hawaii, o Lonoikamakahiki.” A no ko Kakukihewa ma lohe ana, he kanaka akamai o Lonoikamakahiki i ka hoopapa, nolaila, hoomakaukau mua o Kakuhihewa ma no ka hoopapa. A hiki aku la o Lonoikamakahiki, a kau na waa i uka, kiiia mai la na ukana ame ke alii pu, hoihoi ia aku la a ka hale alii o Kakuhihewa.","When Lonoikamakahiki was approaching Kailua, Lanahuimihaku and his companion recognized the canoe of Keawenuiaumi, so they said to Kakuhihewa: “It is the king of Hawaii, Lonoikamakahiki.” As Kakuhihewa and the others had heard that Lonoikamakahiki was a man well versed in the arts of hoopapa, they therefore made preparations and awaited for the arrival of Lonoikamakahiki with everything ready for a contest. Upon the arrival of Lonoikamakahiki, and the double canoe was hauled ashore, the king and the baggage were taken up and carried to the palace of Kakuhihewa."
"I kekahi la ae, hiki mai la o Ohaikawiliula, kekahi alii wahine mai Kauai mai, a no ka nui akamai o Lonoikamakahiki ame kona naauao loa nolaila, lawe ae la ua o Lonoikamakahiki ia Ohaikawiliula i wahine moe nana ia po, i kumu e loaa hou ai iaia kekahi mau kumu hoopapa.

She was a chiefess from Kauai, and because of the great cunning and learning displayed by Lonoikamakahiki he won Ohaikawiliula and was allowed the honor of entertaining her that night, thereby giving him further subjects with which to carry on in the game of hoopapa. After having won Ohaikawiliula for the one night, without ever having an idea of committing any sin with the chiefess from Kauai, only wishing to procure further subjects for his contest with Kakuhihewa, they removed themselves to the end of the house set apart for the use of Lonoikamakahiki. After they had talked of various matters Lonoikamakahiki asked of the chiefess: “When you set sail from Kauai, were you in possession of any new chant having its origin in Kauai?” Ohaikawiliula answered: “There is a [ ] chant, but it is one relating to myself.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked: “Is it a new chant?” Ohaikawiliula again replied: “Yes, it is a very late one. It has not become known in the country districts. It was chanted only in the royal court up to the time of my departure.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked her: “What is the title of the chant?” Ohaikawiliula replied: “The Mirage of Mana.” After this conversation between the two, Lonoikamakahiki began the study of the chant until dawn, by which time he had committed it to memory."
"A ma ke ao ana ae, hoomakaukau ae la o Ohaikawiliula e holo i Hawaii no ke kii ia Manuahi i kane nana. Ia manawa, i na waa e hoomaka aku ana e holo, aole nae i kau aku ke alii wahine, i aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa: “E hele aku oe e noi aku i ke alii wahine o Kauai i mele, malia he wahi mele hou kekahi o Kauai mai i loaa iaia, alaila, ao ae kakou, no ka mea, e lilo e aku auanei i ke alii o Hawaii (Lonoikamakahiki), a malia o ae mai ua o Ohaikawiliula, alaila, nou ka inoa; aia la he alii inoa ole.” A no keia olelo ana a Lanahuimihaku ma pela, nolaila, hele aku la o Kakuhihewa me kona mau kanaka, a hiki i kahi e lana la na waa, a paa aku la o Kakuhihewa ma na lima o ke alii wahine (Ohaikawiliula) me ka ninau aku: “Holo mai nei oe mai Kauai mai, aole he wahi mele hou o Kauai i loaa ia oe?” Hai aku la o Ohaikawiliula: “He mele no.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “He mele hou loa aole i laha i ke kuaaina?” I hou aku o Ohaikawiliula: “Aole i laha i ke kuaaina, i ke alo alii wale iho no a hele wale mai la wau, he wahi inoa no no’u.” Ninau hou aku la o Kakuhihewa: “Owai ua wahi mele la?” “O Kealialia liu o Mana.”","At daylight the next day Ohaikawiliula made preparation to set sail for Hawaii, where she was going to meet her future husband, Manuahi. While this preparation was going on, and the double canoe was being hauled into the sea (the chiefess had not boarded it, however), Lanahuimihaku and his companion said to Kakuhihewa: “You had better run out and ask the chiefess of Kauai for a new chant. It is possible that she knows a late chant from Kauai, then we will study it, else it will be first acquired by the king of Hawaii, Lonoikamakahiki. Ohaikawiliula will surely give her permission that it be used in honor of your name, for Lonoikamakahiki is a chief without any chant dedicated to his name.” Because of these words, spoken by Lanahuimihaku and his companion, Kakuhihewa and his servants went up to where the double canoe was moored and Kakuhihewa reached out and held the chiefess, Ohaikawiliula by the arm, then asked her: “Before setting sail from Kauai, did you not hear of a new chant belonging to Kauai?” Ohaikawiliula replied: “I have a chant.” Kakuhihewa again asked: “Is it a very late one, not heard in the country districts?” Ohaikawiliula replied: “It has not been heard in the country districts; it was used only at the royal court up to the time of my departure. It is one used in honor of my name.” Kakuhihewa again asked: “What is the title of the chant?” “It is ‘The Mirage of Mana,’ ” replied Ohaikawiliula."
"Alaila, ao aku la ua o Kakuhihewa i ua mele nei, ma ka haawi pakahi ana i na lalani mele i na kanaka, a pau ua mele nei, holo aku la o Ohaikawiliula i Hawaii, a hoi aku la no hoi o Kakuhihewa i ka hale me na kanaka, a hookuikui ae la i na hua i haawi pakahi ia i na kanaka, a lilo ae la i mele e like me ko lakou aoia ana e ka mea nana i ao mai ia lakou.","Kakuhihewa then proceeded to master the chant by giving each of his servants a line to commit to memory. After this was done, Ohaikawiliula proceeded on her way to Hawaii, while Kakuhihewa and his servants returned to the house, where the chant was connected line by line, as committed to memory by the servants, until it was mastered in whole just as given them by Ohaikawiliula."
"Aka, i ka manawa i ao ai o Kakuhihewa me Ohaikawiliula i ua mele nei, he mea nani loa nae i ke alii wahine ka hai ole aku ia Kakuhihewa, ua ao ia o Lonoikamakahiki i ua mele nei, aole no hoi i puka iki aku kekahi hua olelo mai kona waha aku; aka, no ka poina loa ana paha, ina paha ua hai oia ua aoia ia Lonoikamakahiki ua mele la, ina ua lilo ole i kumu hoopapa.","When Kakuhihewa was being taught the chant by Ohaikawiliula, it was very considerate of her not to have informed him that she had already taught the same to Lonoikamakahiki. She did not even say a word about the matter; probably she had forgotten all about it. If she had told Kakuhihewa of teaching Lonoikamakahiki the chant it would not have been taken for a subject in the game of hoopapa that followed."
"Mahope iho o ko Kakuhihewa ao ana i ke mele, hele ae la oia me kana mau punahele i ka heenalu, a o Lonoikamakahiki hoi kekahi ma ia hee nalu ana. A pau ka Kakuhihewa ma heenalu ana, hoi aku la lakou a ka hale. Ia manawa, olelo aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa: “E Kakuhihewa!

Lonoikamakahiki also accompanied the king of Oahu in this outing. When it became time for Kakuhihewa to cease surfing he returned to the house with his companions. Just as soon as they reached the house Lanahuimihaku and his companion said to Kakuhihewa: “Say, Kakuhihewa, when the king of Hawaii finishes riding the surf and should send for his loin cloth and kapa, then you refuse the taking [ ] of those things, and tell him that he shall not have the loin cloth and kapa unless he is able to recite the chant that we have just learned this morning.” Kakuhihewa then saw that the proposition spoken by Lanahuimihaku and his companion was a good one, so he carried out the advice given him by the two men."
"A o Lanahuimihaku ma, he mau kanaka punahele ia ma ko Lonoikamakahiki alo, a o laua no na kanaka nui o ko Lonoikamakahiki alo alii, a ua oi ae laua mamua o na kanaka a pau ma ko Lonoikamakahiki ku ana i ka moku; a no ka pau ana o ko Lanahuimihaku ma punahele, nolaila, haalele laua ia Lonoikamakahiki, a holo mai a noho me Kakuhihewa; a o keia mau kanaka, na kanaka i pilikia loa ai o Kakuhihewa ma.","Lanahuimihaku and his companion were great favorites in the court of Lonoikamakahiki prior to their coming to Oahu, and they were recognized as the most important men in the presence of the king. They were well treated and accorded the highest position over all the people when Lonoikamakahiki took charge of the affairs of the government. But there came a time when the king ceased thinking so very much of them; that they were no longer his favorites. Because of this neglect they left Lonoikamakahiki and came and lived with Kakuhihewa. It was these two men that caused great trouble for Kakuhihewa and his people."
"A i ka manawa i hoi mai ai o Lonoikamakahiki mai ka auau mai, hoi aku la a mawaho o ka hale alii o Kakuhihewa, i aku la i ke kahu ia Loli: “E kii aku oe i kuu wahi malo ame kuu wahi kihei.” A no keia olelo a ke alii, nolaila, kii aku la o Loli i ka malo o Lonoikamakahiki i loko o kona hokeo (Kuwalawala) maloko o ko Kakuhihewa hale, kahi i waiho ai, ma ke kala hoi i hookaawaleia nona.","When Lonoikamakahiki returned from having his bath and stood outside of Kakuhihewa’s palace, he said to his attendant, Loli: “You go in and bring out my loin cloth and my cloak.” Because of this order of the king Loli proceeded to get these things, they being in Lonoikamakahiki’s calabash, Kawalawala, which was in the palace, in the end of the house set apart for the use of the king."
"I ka manawa o Loli i komo aku ai i loko o ka hale, a wehe ae la i ka hokeo, kahi i waihoia aku ai na mea o ke alii.

When Kakuhihewa saw Loli uncovering the calabash he said to one of his own retainers: “You go and tell the servant of Lonoikamakahiki not to take the loin cloth until he can chant the mele in honor of the king’s name.” Because of this order from Kakuhihewa the retainer went to meet Loli and said to him: “What are you doing, uncovering the calabash of your ward?” Loli replied: “I am uncovering it for the loin cloth and kapa of the king.” Kakuhihewa’s retainer then said: “You must go back without it. You cannot have the loin cloth until the chant in honor of the king’s name is recited.” Loli then returned and Lonoikamakahiki asked of him: “Where is the loin cloth?” Loli replied: “The loin cloth cannot be had. Kakuhihewa has kept me from taking it. It is only when the chant in honor of Kakuhihewa is recited that the loin cloth can be given up.” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “You go back and get my loin cloth and bring it here, and if they should ask you about the chant, then ask them the title of the king’s chant.”"
"Hoi aku la o Loli a wehe hou no i ka hokeo; ninau hou mai ke kahu o Kakuhihewa: “Heaha kau hana i ka hokeo?” I aku o Loli: “I kii mai nei no wau i ka malo a me ke kapa o ke alii.” I aku la o Kakuhihewa: “He hoopaa anei oe; aole anei oe e lohe, ua oleloia aku nei oe, aia a loaa kuu inoa, alaila, loaa aku ka malo a me ke kapa.” Olelo aku la o Loli: “O ka’u ia i olelo aku nei i ke alii a’u, i mai nei kela, e hoi mai wau a ninau aku i kou inoa.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “O kuu inoa o Kealialia liu o Mana.”","Loli then returned into the house and again uncovered the calabash. The retainer of Kakuhihewa again asked: “What are you doing with the calabash?” Loli replied: “I have come for the king’s loin cloth and kapa.” Kakuhihewa then spoke up: “You are very stubborn. Have you not heard that you have been ordered that only when the chant in my honor can be recited can you get the loin cloth and kapa?” Loli then made reply: “That is just what I have told my king, but he ordered me to return here and ask for the title of your chant.” Kakuhihewa then said: “The title of the chant in honor of my name is ‘The Mirage of Mana.’ ”"
"Hoi wale aku la o Loli me ka nele i ka malo. Ninau mai la o Lonoikamakahiki: “Owai ka inoa o ke alii o Oahu?” Alaila, hai aku la kahi kahu, o Loli: “I mai nei, o [ ] Kealialia liu o Mana.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “O hoi a lawe mai i kuu malo, i olelo hou mai, alaila olelo aku oe, ua olelo aku wau: ‘O Kealialia liu o Mana’ inoa nei no o Lonoikamakahiki la? Pela oe e olelo aku ai.”","Loli was again forced to return without the loin cloth. Upon coming to Lonoikamakahiki he was asked: “What is the title of the chant in honor of the name of the king of Oahu?” The retainer Loli then told him: “He said it was ‘The Mirage of [ ] Mana.’ ” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “You go back and bring my loin cloth. If they should again ask you, you tell them that I have said, ‘The Mirage of Mana’ is the chant in honor of the name of Lonoikamakahiki. You repeat this to them.”"
"A pau ka laua kamailio ana no keia mau mea, a o ka laua olelo hope loa no hoi ia ma keia mau mea, alaila, hoi aku la o Loli a ka hale alii o Kakuhihewa, o Kamoa ka inoa o ua hale alii la.

Again Loli took up the calabash and began to uncover it for the loin cloth and kapa of his king. At this Kakuhihewa again asked: “Say, Loli, why are you again uncovering the calabash belonging to your ward?” Loli made reply: “It is for the king’s loin cloth.” Kakuhihewa said: “Have you not heard that you cannot get the loin cloth until the chant in my honor is recited?” Loli replied: “I have told him that, but he replied by asking, ‘What is the title of the chant of Kakuhihewa?’ I replied: ‘The Mirage of Mana.’ He made reply: ‘Is it “The Mirage of Mana,” the chant in honor of the name of Lonoikamakahiki?’ This is the reply made by my king, and that is all.” Because of this reply made by Loli, Kakuhihewa asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Is this chant really in honor of the name of the king of Hawaii?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “It is a lie; he has no chant in honor of his name like this one. He is a chief without a chant. You must not be afraid; make a wager with him.”"
"Mahope iho o ko Kakuhihewa lohe ana ia Loli no ko Lonoikamakahiki hai ana mai, nona ka inoa, ke mele hoi a laua e hoopapa nei, alaila, olelo pu ae la na ’lii a elua, no na kumu pili a laua; a maopopo ae la, haawi mai la o Kakuhihewa i ka aina, mai ka lae o Leahi a ka lae o Kaena mau ia Eleeleualani, ke kahili nui o Lonoikamakahiki.

After this was agreed on the two kings came together to decide on their bets. Some time was taken up in this before they agreed upon the different objects for the wager. Kakuhihewa on his side offered that portion of Oahu from Leahi point to the Kaena point as against the large feather kahili of Lonoikamakahiki, Eleeleualani. Lonoikamakahiki on his side would not agree to this, saying: “I will not wager my feather kahili for that amount of land.” Because Lonoikamakahiki refused to agree to this offer made by Kakuhihewa, Kakuhihewa again offered all the lands, in addition to the former offer, embraced within the point of Kaena to the Kaoio point at Kualoa."
"A no keia pili ana mai a Kakuhihewa, aneane e pau loa o Oahu nei, alaila, olelo aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Aole e mau kuu kahili ia pili.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “Ole ae la ka’u pili, ia oe mai hoi ia wahi.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “O kuu kahili a [ ] mau ia loko o ka hale, alaila, ae wau.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “Ua mau; o loko wale ae la no ka hoi o ka hale ka pili o kou kahili la, mai lilo hewa ka aina ia oe.”","Because of this last offer made by Kakuhihewa, which really meant the passing away from him of almost all the lands of Oahu, Lonoikamakahiki replied: “I will not allow my feather kahili to be wagered for the amount of land you offer.” Kakuhihewa then replied: “Since you have not agreed to my offer, make your offer then.” Lonoikamakahiki said: “I will wager my feather kahili as against the inside of this house.” Kakuhihewa then made answer: “That is agreed; here it is. You are satisfied with [ ] the inside of the house as against your kahili, while I was offering you almost all my possessions, which I had the chance of losing to you.”"
"A pau ka laua pili ana, akahi no a haawaiia aku ka malo a me ke kapa o Lonoikamakahiki. I aku o Kakuhihewa: “Ia oe mua; e hana mai oe i kou inoa, a pau hoi kau hana ana, alaila, ia makou aku.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ia oukou paha mua, i ka poe lawe wale i ka inoa o kekahi; no oukou iho la ka hoi ia inoa; a o ke akaka ia o ko oukou inoa. A pau hoi ka oukou, alaila, ia’u aku.”","After the wagers had been agreed on, the loin cloth and kapa of Lonoikamakahiki were given up at last. Kakuhihewa then said: “You recite the chant first, for you have claimed that the chant was one in honor of your name. After you have finished, then we will recite ours.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “You people had better make the first recital, since I have claimed that you have appropriated the chant belonging to others and are claiming it your own. In this way we will ascertain positively whether the chant is yours. After you have finished, then I will make my recital.”"
"A no ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo ana aku ia Kakuhihewa pela, alaila, lilo mua ae la ia Kakuhihewa ka hana mua o ke mele a lakou i ao ai me Ohaikawiliula. A eia malalo iho ua wahi mele la a laua e hoopapa nei:","Because of this argument advanced by Lonoikamakahiki, Kakuhihewa agreed that they make the first recital of the chant taught them by Ohaikawiliula. Following is the chant that caused the dispute:"
"O Kealialia liu o Mana. Ke uhai la no. Ke uhai la ka wai, Ke uhai la ka wai a Kamakahou; Wai alialia, Wai o Mana. Me he kai la ka wai, Me he wai la ke kai, Me he kai la ka wai a Kamakahou.

The water is following, The water of Kamakahou is following; The water that is not water, The mirage of Mana. Like the sea is the water, Like the water is the sea, Like the sea is the water of Kamakahou. The sugar-cane trash from my eating was cast away. After I had gone beyond I failed to recognize. What was seen behind, again appears in front. The Iliau has wilted in the sun [As] the plentiful dew of the morning. Passed are the emblems of the god of the year, Gone to bury the dead [On] the barren sands of Nonohili. The coconut grove bends low seaward of Pokii, In reverence to [the god] Makalii."
"“Aia la, holo ko makou inoa, a ia oe hoi.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Aole no oukou ka inoa, no’u ka inoa.” I aku la o Kakuhihewa: “O ke akaka ia o kou inoa ke hana mai oe.” Alaila, hana aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i kona inoa ponoi a Hauna i ao mai ai ia ia, a hoohuipu aku la me ke mele a ka wahine o Kauai i ao mai ai ia laua, e like me malalo iho: [ ]","“There, that is the chant in honor of our name. Now it is your turn.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “The chant is not yours, it is mine.” Kakuhihewa said: “We will know it is your chant, without any doubt, after you have recited it.” Lonoikamakahiki then began the recital of the chant, first taking the chant in his own name as taught him by Hauna, and at the end he added on the chant taught him by the chiefess from Kauai. Following is the chant in full: [ ]"
"Ma keia wahi, e hookomo iho i ke mele i koe, he wahi inoa no no Lonoikamakahiki, a oia ke mele i lohe ai o Lanahuimihaku, a oia ke mele i kamau ia mai maluna o ke mele a laua i ao ia ai e Ohaikawiliula.","One can here follow on with the portion of the chant that remains. It is also a chant in honor of the name of Lonoikamakahiki, which is the one that Lanahuimihaku heard, and it is often added to the chant taught them by Ohaikawiliula."
"I kela manawa a Lonoikamakahiki e heluhelu ana i kela mele a Ohaikawiliula i ao ai ia Kakuhihewa ma, a ike aku la ua loaa kela mele ia Lonoikamakahiki, i aku la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “E!

Malia paha ua holo ae kekahi waa ma ka moana ae, a Hawaii, ao mai nei i keia mele.”","When Lonoikamakahiki was repeating the chant which Ohaikawiliula had taught Kakuhihewa, Kakuhihewa saw that Lonoikamakahiki knew it, so he said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Say, I see that Lonoikamakahiki knows of this chant?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied, saying to Kakuhihewa: “Yes, we see that he does. We lived with him while in Hawaii, but he had no chant of this kind. It is possible, however, that a canoe has gone to Hawaii without touching here and the chant was carried to Hawaii in that way.”"
"I ka manawa i eo ai o Kakuhihewa ma ia Lonoikamakahiki, alaila, kena ae la o Kakuhihewa i na kanaka a pau o loko o ka hale, e puka i waho a koe iho ka hale no ke alii o Hawaii no Lonoikamakahiki.

Eia ka i pili aku nei oe e make makou.”","After Kakuhihewa was beaten by Lonoikamakahiki, Kakuhihewa ordered all the people to get out of the house and thus leave the house to Lonoikamakahiki, the king of Hawaii, who had won. When this order was given Lonoikamakahiki was standing just outside of the door with a war club in his hands. As soon as the order was given to vacate the house the men immediately proceeded to go out; but as soon as the first party started out they were killed by Lonoikamakahiki. When the people saw this they retreated back into the house for they were afraid of being put to death by Lonoikamakahiki. When Kakuhihewa saw the people coming back into the house he asked: “Why are you people coming back? Don’t you know that we have to get out and leave the house to Lonoikamakahiki?” The people replied: “Don’t you know that you made a foolish bet? Such and such persons have been killed by Lonoikamakahiki. Here you have made a wager whereby we are to be killed.”"
"A lohe o Kakuhihewa i keia leo, alaila, olelo aku la oia ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ea! He oiaio kela olelo?” I aku o ua o Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ae, he oiaio, no ka [ ] mea, pili aku nei kakou i ka aina, a he puni wale ae no koe o Oahu nei, aole kela i ae mai e pili i ko iala kahili, nolaila pili mai nei kela ia loko o ka hale nei; i pili mai kela nou no ke alii a me na kanaka, o ka pau no i ka make. Eo aku la kakou. Kahea ia aku ua alii la, e ola kakou.” Alaila, kahea aku la o Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Hawaii e! E ola. Ua eo ia oe.”","When Kakuhihewa heard this from the people, he said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Say, is this true?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion then replied: [ ] “Yes, it is true, because when you offered to wager your lands until there remained but a very small portion of Oahu he refused and would not wager his feather kahili for all the land you offered; but he accepted instead the inside of this house. He took this offer because of yourself the king, and your people, in order to kill us. We are beaten. You had better cry out to the king for mercy, and that we be saved.” Kakuhihewa then called out: “Say, King of Hawaii, have mercy! You have won.”"
"A lohe o Lonoikamakahiki i keia olelo, a me ka leo kahea maloko mai, alaila, hooko ae la oia aole e luku aku e like me kana noonoo mua ana, a ma ka inoa o kona kanawai mau, “Kai Okia Kanawai,” nolaila, aole he luku hou ana a Lonoikamakahiki i koe. A oia no hoi ka hoomaka mua ana o ka Lonoikamakahiki hoopapa ana.","When Lonoikamakahiki heard this call for mercy, together with the cries of the people, he desisted and allowed the people to get away, and in the name of his regularly accepted law, “Mercy has rendered the law useless,” he withheld his hand and would not attack the people further. This was the beginning of the many hoopapa contests of Lonoikamakahiki."
"Mahope iho o keia eo ana o Kakuhihewa ma ia Lonoikamakahiki, alaila, olelo aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa, me ka i aku: “E Kakuhihewa, he nani ia ua eo ae nei kakou i ke alii o Hawaii ma keia pili ana; o kana eo hoi ia.

Our idea is this: we think it a good plan that we go out fishing. It is more than possible that the king of Hawaii can be enticed to follow us out, and if he does, and he gets excited over the sport, he will surely ask us for hook, line and bait; then we will shame him, for he is a king without any knowledge of the art of fishing. If this can be done we will be able to defeat him, and you will then get his feather kahili.”"
"A no ia mea, hooholo ae la o Kakuhihewa i kona manao ae, mamuli o ka Lanahuimihaku ma olelo, me ke kanalua ole, no ka mea, o na mea a pau a Lanahuimihaku ma e olelo ai, malaila wale no o Kakuhihewa e hilinai ai.","Because of this, Kakuhihewa made up his mind to agree to this proposition expressed by Lanahuimihaku and his companion, so all doubts were removed from his mind as to his ability to win the feather kahili, and being easily led by Lanahuimihaku and his companion, Kakuhihewa of course consented. It was a common thing with Kakuhihewa to give in to the wishes of the two men, for he had the most implicit confidence in them."
"I ke kakahiaka o kekahi la ae, hoomakaukau ae la o Kakuhihewa ma i na waa, a holo aku la i ka lawaia ma ke koa lawaia i oleloia o Akaka, mawaho pono aku o Kailua, ma kahi e ike aku ana ia Kahuku, ma Koolauloa, a me Mokuoniki ma ka aoao hikina o Molokai.","On the morning of the day after, Kakuhihewa and his men made ready the double canoe and set out for the fishing grounds for a day of fishing. The fishing grounds they decided to go to that day were the ones called Akaka, directly out of Kailua, at a point from which Kahuku in Koolauloa and Mokuoniki on the east of Molokai could be seen."
"A ike aku la o Lonoikamakahiki e holo ana o Kakuhihewa i ka lawaia, alaila olelo aku la ua o Lonoikamakahiki i ke kahu ia Loli: “E aho paha e hahai kakou mahope o Kakuhihewa ma, e makaikai aku ai i ka lawaia a ke alii o Oahu nei.” I aku la o Loli i kana hanai: “Mai une oe ia kakou e holo i kai, ina e paakiki oe o ko’u make no ia, no ka mea, aole oe i ike i ka lawaia.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki ia Loli “Heaha auanei kou kumu e make wale iho ai?” I aku la ke kahu: “Eia hoi kuu mea e make ai, o ka holo o kaua a ka moana nana aku oe i ka lawaia a Kakuhihewa ma, [ ] lealea aku oe i ka lakou la huki mai i ka ia.

Because of that desire you will ask for hook and line, and they will refuse and insult you with such expression as this: ‘Where have you been that you should come here unprepared?’ Therefore you will be ashamed; and this will cause my death.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “Why should they refuse to give me hook and line? Only the ignorant will refuse to give hook and line.” The attendant said: “Yes, that would be the proper way of reasoning if things were right between you, but as things stand now they do not think well of you, for you have beaten them, and for this reason they will refuse giving you what you ask.” But with all this advice given by his attendant the king’s desire to go out was not abated; in fact, the desire became stronger, and Lonoikamakahiki finally demanded of his servant that they follow Kakuhihewa and his companions and look on while they fished."
"A no ko ke alii manao paa loa, nolaila, olelo aku la o Loli ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Auhea oe? He nani ia ke paakiki la oe i ka holo i kai; a ina holo kaua i kai, a i lealea aku oe i ka huki mai a Kakuhihewa ma i ka ia, a ina i noi aku oe i ke aho ame ka makau, a me na mea lawaia a pau, a i pakikeia mai oe, alaila, pepehi iho oe ia’u a make, lawe ae oe i kuu naau i aho nau, o kuu iwi papakole no kau makau, maunu iho oe i kuu io, a o kuu poo no kau paka, alaila, kuu iho no oe i ke kai, a kuehu ae i ka paka, alaila, kahea iho oe ma kuu inoa: ‘E, Loli e!

Since you have become stubborn about going fishing, I want you to bear in mind what I have to say to you. After we come up to Kakuhihewa and his companions, and you should wish to do some fishing yourself after seeing Kakuhihewa haul out several fish, and if you should ask for hook and line and they should refuse and insult you, then you must kill me, take out my intestine and use it for a line, and my thigh bone for your hook; then take my flesh and use it for your bait, and my head you can use as a sinker; then lower the whole thing into the sea and, after giving a jerk, call out in my name as follows: ‘Say, Loli! Say, Loli, the fish without eyes!! Catch a fish for us, Loli.’ Then you will hook an ahi.” After giving Lonoikamakahiki these instructions they proceeded out to sea."
"He mau kanaka kaulana laua ma na moku a puni, no ko laua mana a me ko laua malama ana i ke akua, a he hiki ia laua ke hana i na hana mana he nui, ma ka inoa o ko Keawenuiaumi akua.

It was because of this great power that Loli was able to see the future and so instructed his king Lonoikamakahiki to kill him in order to obtain line, hook and bait."
KA HOLO ANA O LONOIKAMAKAHIKI E MAKAIKAI I KA LAWAIA A KAKUHIHEWA MA.,HOW LONOIKAMAKAHIKI FOLLOWED TO SEE KAKUHIHEWA AND HIS COMPANIONS FISH.

This rock was a very small one for the purpose, but to prove the supernatural powers of Hauna it served the purpose as an anchor, although a strong gale came up and for a short time it blew quite fiercely. When the storm was blowing, the rock that served as an anchor for the double canoe of Kakuhihewa was unable to hold the canoe and so it was carried off to the leeward of the fishing grounds for some distance. The double canoe of Lonoikamakahiki, however, never moved a bit, and the small rock held it as though a large anchor had been used. This was because of the supernatural powers of Hauna."
"Ia manawa, makemake aku la o Kakuhihewa i ka pohaku hekau o ke alii o Hawaii. Alaila manao ae la oia (Kakuhihewa) o ko Lonoikamakahiki kumu pili ia e pili mai ai ia Kakuhihewa.","When Kakuhihewa saw how the double canoe of the king of Hawaii was held by the small mooring rock he expressed the desire of possessing it, so he immediately made up his mind to name the rock in his next wager with Lonoikamakahiki."
"Ia Lonoikamakahiki ma e lana ana maluna o na waa, i aku la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “Kupanaha ka pohaku hekau o ke alii o Hawaii.” I aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ae, ua ike maua i kela pohaku lana o ke alii o Hawaii, he nui wale ka pohaku i like me kela.” A no keia olelo a Lanahuimihaku ma, manao o Kakuhihewa e kii i pohaku nana i Hawaii.

We have seen several rocks like that.” Because of this answer given by Lanahuimihaku and his companion, Kakuhihewa thought he would send for one like it from Hawaii, but Lanahuimihaku and his companion said: “You cannot make use of that kind of rock, however, because your attendants do not possess supernatural powers. That rock holds that canoe because of the supernatural powers of Hauna.”"

Ina he mau mea lawaia ka ua alii la o Hawaii alaila hewa io.” Alaila pau ae la ko Kakuhihewa manao ana pela.","When Lonoikamakahiki and his companions were moored directly at the bow of the double canoe of Kakuhihewa, Kakuhihewa was sore displeased, for he knew that such a thing was not considered right by all fishermen. This displeasure was so strong that he spoke of the matter and remarked that he did not at all like the way Lonoikamakahiki’s double canoe was moored. But Lanahuimihaku and his companion, however, said: “Don’t at all mind it. If the king of Hawaii has any fishing implements with him then it would be wrong.” This reply satisfied Kakuhihewa for he thought no more of the matter."
"Ia manawa a Kakuhihewa ma e kamailio ana me Lanahuimihaku ma, lou ana ka ia ia Kakuhihewa. I aku la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “E! Lou ka ia, heaha la?” I aku o Lanahuimihaku ma: “He ulua. Ninau ia aku ke alii o Hawaii.” A no ia mea, kahea aku la o Kakuhihewa: “Ahaha! E, ke alii o Hawaii, he aha ka ia?” I aku o Loli ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Koho ia aku he mano.” I aku la o Lonoikamakahiki e like me ka Loli olelo: “He mano.”","While Kakuhihewa and Lanahuimihaku and his companion were talking, Kakuhihewa felt a fish tugging at his hook, so he said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Say, I have caught a fish. What can it be?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion said: “It must be an ulua. Ask the king of Hawaii what it is.” Because of this, Kakuhihewa called out: “There you are! Say, King of Hawaii, what kind of a fish have I caught?” Loli said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Tell him that it is a shark.” Lonoikamakahiki therefore replied as directed by Loli, saying: “It is a shark.”"
"A no ke koho ana aku a Lonoikamakahiki he mano, nolaila, ninau ae la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “He mano io anei?” I aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma: “Aole he mano, ua wahahee ke alii o Hawaii, lawaia auanei hoi kakou i keia koa a kakou e lawaia nei, he mano kekahi. Kai noa, ua hoolaaia keia koa i ke akua, aole e komo ka mano i keia koa. Piliia aku, akahi hana ana a ke alii o Hawaii e eo ai.” [ ]",Because Lonoikamakahiki had named the fish to be a shark Kakuhihewa asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Is it a shark?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “It is not a shark. The king of Hawaii deceives himself. Here we have been fishing on these grounds many times and we never have caught a single shark. You also know that these fishing grounds have been dedicated to our god and [ ] no shark can come here. Make a wager with him. You will for the first time beat the king of Hawaii now.”
"A nolaila, ma ka olelo a Lanahuimihaku ma, olelo aku la o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki: “E ke alii o Hawaii, e pono no paha ke pili, ina no hoi he mano, ua eo makou ia oe, aka hoi he ulua ka ia e paa nei i ka makou makau, alaila ua eo oe ia makou.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “I aha ka pili?” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “Mai Leahi a hiki i ka lae o Kaena, mau i ko wahi pohaku lana.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua mau.” Alaila huki ae la o Kakuhihewa i ke aho, a i ke kokoke ana ae i luna, alaila i aku o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “He mano.

A no ia mea, i mai o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua eo, no ko makou ike maoli ana he koa mano ole keia, nolaila wale no makou i pili ino aku ai.”","Because of these words of Lanahuimihaku and his companion, Kakuhihewa said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Say, King of Hawaii, we had better make a wager. If it is a shark you beat us; but if the fish I hold should prove to be an ulua, then we beat you.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “What shall our wagers be?” Kakuhihewa said: “From Leahi to the Kaena point, I will place against your mooring rock.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “It is a bet.” Kakuhihewa then pulled on his line and when the fish was almost to the surface, Kakuhihewa said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “It is a shark. We have lost to the king of Hawaii.” Lanahuimihaku and his companion then looked down and when they saw it was a shark they nodded to Kakuhihewa to let go the line so as to allow the shark to break away and in that way get rid of it before the others could see it. But Lonoikamakahiki had seen the nod and at once saw the intention of Kakuhihewa and his companions to allow the fish to break away from the line; so he called out to Kakuhihewa and the others: “Say, King of Oahu, don’t play false and allow the fish to get away by letting go of the line. If you don’t see the shark, pull it in to be certain.” Kakuhihewa was therefore forced to pull on the line and after a while they all saw plainly that it was a shark. Because of this Kakuhihewa said to Lonoikamakahiki: “You have won. It was because we were certain that no sharks came to these fishing grounds that we made the wager with you.”"
"He oiaio he koa mano ole kela, no ka mea, ua hoomanamanaia kela koa i mua o ke akua, aole e komo mai ka mano. Aka, ma ka mana o Loli a me Hauna, ua lilo ke koa mano ole i koa mano. A eo ae la o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki, a lilo ae la kekahi hapa o Oahu nei ia Lonoikamakahiki, mai Leahi a Kaena.","It was a well-known fact that no sharks were caught on these fishing grounds, as the place was dedicated to the gods, hence no sharks were supposed to get there, as the gods had charge of the place; but by the supernatural powers of Loli and Hauna the fishing grounds known to be without sharks became a place infested with them. Having won the wager, Kakuhihewa lost to Lonoikamakahiki that portion of Oahu from Leahi to Kaena point, which became the property of Lonoikamakahiki."
"Mahope iho o keia mau mea, kupu ae la ko Lonoikamakahiki manao lealea i ka lawaia, alaila, olelo aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Oahu! Homai hoi kau wahi makau, i wahi aho mai me ka maunu, a i paka mai no.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “I hea no hoi kou makaukau hele pu mai oe, o ka makou ka kau mea i manao ai, i anei kou lako?” I aku ke kahu o Loli: “E kuu alii! A, hilahila oe; kai noa o ka’u ia e olelo aku ana ia oe, aole kaua e holo mai i kai nei; a nolaila, pepehiia iho wau.”","After this had taken place the desire to take a hand at fishing overcame Lonoikamakahiki, so he said to Kakuhihewa: “Say, King of Oahu, let me have a hook, line and some bait and also a sinker.” Kakuhihewa replied: “Why did you not come prepared when you came out to fish? Did you suppose that we were to supply you with these things necessary for a fisherman?” Loli, the attendant, then said: “My king, you have been shamed. This is what I expected and therefore warned you that we had better not come out. Now, therefore, you must kill me.”"
"A e like me ka olelo mua a kona kahu, pepehi iho la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Loli, a hana iho la e like me ka Loli aoao ana. A kuu iho la i ke kai, a olelo iho la e like me ka Loli olelo mua: “E, Loli!

He then called the words taught him by Loli, saying: “Say, Loli! Say, Loli, the fish without eyes of the sea!! Catch us a fish, Loli.” At that very moment, as soon as the last word was spoken, an ahi bit his hook. As soon as he felt the bite Lonoikamakahiki called out: “Say, Kakuhihewa, what kind of a fish have I caught?” Kakuhihewa hesitated for a while, then asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “What kind of a fish has the king of Hawaii caught?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “Name it a shark, because the first fish caught being a shark there must be a lot of them down below.” Because of this, and [ ] in accordance with the words of Lanahuimihaku and his companion, he answered Lonoikamakahiki, saying: “It is a shark.” Lonoikamakahiki answered back: “No, you are mistaken, King of Oahu.” Kakuhihewa then asked Lonoikamakahiki: “And what do you say it is?” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “This is not a shark, it is an ahi.”"
"A no keia olelo ana aku a Lonoikamakahiki pela, alaila, ninau ae la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “He ahi io anei ka ia a ke alii o Hawaii?” I mai o Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ua wahahee ke alii o Hawaii. Kai noa ua ike no kakou aole he mau koa lawaia ahi o Oahu nei, o Niihau ame Hawaii wale no na aina koa ahi; pili ia aku.” Kahea aku la o Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Hawaii e! E pili no hoi paha; mai ka lae o Kaena a ka lae o Kaoio, mau i ko wahi pohaku lana.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua mau.”","Because of this reply made by Lonoikamakahiki, Kakuhihewa therefore asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Is the fish caught by the king of Hawaii really an ahi?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “The king of Hawaii is deceiving us. Don’t you know that everybody knows that no ahi can be caught in Oahu, and that such fish can only be caught at Niihau and Hawaii fishing stations? Make a wager with him.” Kakuhihewa then called out: “Say, King of Hawaii, let us settle on a wager then. From the Kaena point to the Kaoio point as against your mooring rock.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “It is a bet.”"
"Alaila, ma ka pau ana o ka pili a laua, huki ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i ke aho, a kokoke e ikeia ka ia, ia manawa, ahai pono aku la ua ia nei a Lonoikamakahiki malalo pono o na waa o Kakuhihewa ma.

Alaila, i aku o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa: “Ua eo kakou i ke alii o Hawaii, eia la he ahi io ka ia a ke alii.”","As soon as the wager was settled Lonoikamakahiki pulled on the line and when the fish was almost to the surface he allowed it to pull away directly below the double canoe of Kakuhihewa and his companions. At this time Kakuhihewa and his men made out that the fish caught by Lonoikamakahiki was an ahi. As the fish was plainly seen Lanahuimihaku and his companion said to Kakuhihewa: “We are beaten by the king of Hawaii, for here it is; the fish is really an ahi.”"
"A pili ae la ka ia ma ka aoao o na waa o Lonoikamakahiki ma, lawe ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i ka lei lehua a me ka lei hala i hoomakaukau mua ia, a hookomo ae la ma ka api o ka ia, ma na aoao elua, a kahea aku la ia Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Oahu e! Mai Hawaii loa mai nei ka keia ia. O ke ahi mahaoo o Umulau, eia la ke lei mai nei i ka lei hala a me ka lei lehua.”","When the fish came up to the side of the canoe of Lonoikamakahiki, Lonoikamakahiki took a wreath of lehua blossoms and a wreath of hala, which had been made ready beforehand for this purpose, and put them around the gills of the fish, and then called out to Kakuhihewa: “Say, King of Oahu, this fish must have come all the way from Hawaii, for it is the yellow-gilled ahi of Umulau, for it is wearing wreaths of hala and of lehua.”"
"A lohe o Kakuhihewa i keia olelo a Lonoikamakahiki, he mea kupanaha ia ia Kakuhihewa ma. Alaila olelo aku la, ia Lanahuimihaku ma, me ka ninau aku: “Ea, ua ike anei olua, he lei mai no ko Hawaii ahi i ka lehua a me ka hala?” I aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ua wahahee keia hana ana a ke alii o Hawaii. Piliia aku.”","When Kakuhihewa heard these words of Lonoikamakahiki he, as well as those with him, was surprised and therefore asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion, saying: “Do you two know that the ahi of Hawaii wear wreaths of lehua and hala?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “The king of Hawaii is deceiving us. Make another wager.”"
"A ma keia olelo, alaila kahea aku la o Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Hawaii e! E pili. Mai ka lae o Kaoio a Mokapu, mau i ko wahi pohaku lana.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua mau.” A holo ka laua olelo, alaila, hoohuli muku ae la na waa o Lonoikamakahiki, a kamakamaka ae la i ka ia a paa, alaila, hoikeike ae la i ka lei lehua a me ka lei hala i mua o Kakuhihewa ma, a eo ae la o Kakuhihewa.","In obedience to this Kakuhihewa therefore called out: “Say, King of Hawaii, let us make a wager. From the Kaoio point to Mokapu I will place against your mooring rock.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “It is a bet.” As soon as the bet was made the stern of the double canoe of Lonoikamakahiki was turned toward the double canoe of Kakuhihewa, the fish was then made fast and Lonoikamakahiki showed the wreaths to Kakuhihewa, so that he was beaten."
"Mahope iho o keia eo ana o Kakuhihewa, olelo aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa: “Eo ae la kakou ma keia mau mea, a aneane pau loa o Oahu nei.

Now, therefore, we had better do this: let us wager the rest of the island, from Mokapu to Leahi, as against the mooring rock, and let us have a canoe race. The canoe that will reach dry land first shall be the winner. If the king of Hawaii should agree to this then we will surely win, because he has but two rowers.”"
"A no keia olelo a Lanahuimihaku ma, olelo aku la o Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Hawaii, hoopauia aku kou aina i puni.” I mai o Lonoikamakahiki: “E aha kaua?” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “E heihei waa kakou, aia no hoi o na waa e kau e i ka maloo, nana ke eo; o kahi no hoi i koe a mau i ko wahi pohaku lana.” I aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua mau.” [ ] Mahope iho o ka laua pili ana, kena aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kakuhihewa: “Holo e aku mamua.” A lohe o Lanahuimihaku ma i keia huaolelo kena a Lonoikamakahiki, i aku la ia Kakuhihewa, me ka hoolale koke aku o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa e olelo aku i na hoe waa e hoe.

Let the double canoe that will reach dry land first be the winner, and let that portion of the island of Oahu that is left be placed against your mooring rock.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “It is a bet.” After the bets had been made, Lonoikamakahiki said to Kakuhihewa: “You had better go on ahead.” When Lanahuimihaku and his companion heard Lonoikamakahiki ask of Kakuhihewa to proceed on ahead, they urged Kakuhihewa to order the rowers to go ahead. The order was therefore given and they started off."
"A hala aku la ko Kakuhihewa ma mau waa; alaila, kena aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i kona mau hoe waa e paina; alaila, paina lakou.

The men then took some food. By this time Kakuhihewa and his companions were almost out of sight. When they finished their meal Lonoikamakahiki ordered his rowers, Kaiehu and Kapahi, to row away. At the order the men began to row, taking the Koolauloa way and by way of Kona and then on in toward Waimanalo. After going for some time Kakuhihewa and his men laid to and awaited for the approach of Lonoikamakahiki, thinking that when they came up nearer they would then make land."
"Ia manawa a lakou e kali la, aia nae o Lonoikamakahiki e holo mai ana maloko o Waimanalo, a hiki ae i Kailua.

When Lonoikamakahiki and his men were about to get to the landing place Kakuhihewa for the first time caught sight of them, so he said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “I want you two to look and see what double canoe that is that is entering the landing place.” Lanahuimihaku and his companion then looked and said: “That canoe is Lonoikamakahiki’s. We are beaten.” Kakuhihewa then said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Where did they come from?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “They must have come by way of Koolau, then by way of Waianae and Kona.” Kakuhihewa said: “I thought you said that we were to win this race; but here it is we are beaten. You two are indeed strange. Here the whole of the island is gone, all through your advice, which I have always obeyed. Now my kingdom is lost to Lonoikamakahiki.” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “We were made bold to make a request for a canoe race with the king of Hawaii because we saw we have sixteen rowers while the king of Hawaii has but two.” When Kakuhihewa lost this last wager he lost the whole of the island of Oahu to Lonoikamakahiki."
"Mahope iho o keia mau mea, pili aku la o Kakuhihewa i ke kaikamahine ana, e hoi ka aina iaia, ma ke konane nae.

The game they played, however, was the game of konane. Kakuhihewa was an expert at the game; in fact this was the one thing in which he excelled in all the games he had made a study of, and knowing this Kakuhihewa challenged Lonoikamakahiki. This challenge Lonoikamakahiki accepted. Lonoikamakahiki, on the other hand, was not an expert in the game of konane, for the only time he played the game was when they were staying at Kalaupapa, where he played with his cousin, his wife."
"Hoomaka ae la na pili a laua a pau, alaila, kau na iliili apau, olelo aku o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kakuhihewa: “O kau lawe mua.” Nolaila, lawe ae la o Kakuhihewa i ka iliili mua, a lawe o Lonoikamakahiki, kui mai la o Kakuhihewa, a holo aku o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kakuhihewa: “O kau lawe mua.” Nolaila, lawe ae la o Kakuhihewa i ka iliili mua, a lawe o Lonoikamakahiki, kui mai la o Kakuhihewa, a holo aku o Lonoikamakahiki, a holo pu me Kakuhihewa, alaila lilo ka hauna hope ia Lonoikamakahiki.

Lonoikamakahiki then said to Kakuhihewa: “You make the first move.” Kakuhihewa therefore made the first move, and Lonoikamakahiki followed with the next. Kakuhihewa made [ ] another move, and Lonoikamakahiki made his. Kakuhihewa made several moves and so did Lonoikamakahiki. After this Lonoikamakahiki had his own way with the game. Of course Kakuhihewa was beaten in the first game, but since they had agreed before the start that two games must be won before the winner can claim the wager, the stones were again placed on the board and Lonoikamakahiki made the first move. In this second game Lonoikamakahiki proved to be the best player, and the game was almost won when it was stopped because of the arrival of Kaikilani at Kailua from Hawaii."
"A ike aku la na kanaka i na waa, nana aku la o Lonoikamakahiki, a ike aku la o Kaikilani keia, alaila, aole he makemake e ike aku i ko Kaikilani mau maka, a i mea e like ai me kona kanawai i kau ai i Molokai mahope iho o kona pepehi ana ia Kaikilani, nolaila, hoolilo loa iho la o Lonoikamakahiki i kona mau maka i ka papa konane, i ole ai oia e ike aku ia Kaikilani.","When the people saw a double canoe approaching they mentioned the fact and Lonoikamakahiki looked up and saw that it was Kaikilani, but not wanting to see her, in order to live up to the law laid down by him while in Molokai, after he had beaten Kaikilani, he therefore kept his face down onto the board so that he would not see her."
"A o Kaikilani hoi, iaia i pae mai ai iuka, hele aku la oia a ku mawaho o ka pa, ma ka paehumu hoi, ike aku la oia ia Lonoikamakahiki e konane ana, ua huli aku ke alo iloko o ka hale.

A penei kana kahea ana aku:","Kaikilani, on the other hand, when she came ashore approached the wall surrounding the house and on coming to the railing she saw Lonoikamakahiki playing konane, with his face turned toward the inside of the house. Upon seeing Lonoikamakahiki, Kaikilani recited the chant in his honor, similar to the one that appears in Chapter V. The chant was recited by her as follows:"
"Apau ka Kaikilani kahea ana mai i ka inoa o Lonoikamakahiki, alaila huli mai la o Lonoikamakahiki i hope, i nana aku ko ia nei hana, o ke kaikuahine keia ona e ku nei mawaho; ia manawa nui ae la ko Lonoikamakahiki aloha, aole nae e hiki ke hoomanawanui i kona uwe ana, aka, aole nae oia i uwe me ka leo, ma ke kulu o kona mau waimaka i ike ia ai kona uwe ana.","At the close of Kaikilani’s call or chant in honor of the name of Lonoikamakahiki he turned around and pretended as though it was the first time he had seen his cousin who had been standing outside of the enclosure. At sight of her, Lonoikamakahiki could scarcely contain himself, and his love for her was such that, try as he would, he could not withhold his tears; he was, however, able to refrain from crying out aloud."
"A no ke kahea ana mai o ke kaikuahine i ko Lonoikamakahiki inoa, alaila nana pono aku la ua o Lonoikamakahiki ia Lanahuimihaku ma, no ka mea, ua makemake oia e hana aku i ko Kaikilani inoa, aka, aole he loaa, a oia ko Lonoikamakahiki mea i nana pono aku ai ia Lanahuimihaku ma, na mea i loaa ko Kaikilani inoa.

But Lanahuimihaku and his companion, however, did not wish to come to his assistance, for they were supporters of Kakuhihewa."
"Ia manawa, loaa ae la ia Lonoikamakahiki na lalani mua eha o ko Kaikilani inoa, a huipu ae la me na lalani mele apo wale a ua o Lonoikamakahiki, alaila haliu aku la a kahea aku la i ka inoa o ke kaikuahine ma ke mele penei:","After a time, however, the first four lines of Kaikilani’s chant came to his memory, and together with a few lines which he picked up Lonoikamakahiki chanted the following response to the chant in his honor:"
"Kuu pali lehua i Kilou, Kuu aina lehua i lalo-e, Kuu kanaka lehua i ka pali, Lehua o kuu aina. E i ae oe ia lakou la He keikunane wau nou. Ae—. Ae—. Ae—. A kela puu wau, A keia puu au, Lumilumi i kou aahu. Nana mai ka pali lehua Owau e lehei aku ana.","My cliff of lehua at Kilou, My land of lehua there below, My man of lehua on the cliff, Lehua of my land. You must tell the others That I am your cousin. Yes—. Yes—. Yes—. I was at that hill, I was at this hill, Muss up your apparel. The cliff of lehua looked on As I was jumping down."
"A lohe o Kakuhihewa i ka hana a Lonoikamakahiki i ka inoa o ke kaikuahine, i mai la ua o Kakuhihewa: “Aia o ua o Lonoikamakahiki, ke hana ala i ko hai inoa, aole i hana mai i kona inoa.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua hana hoi; kai noa e hana aku ana, e uwe ae hoi me ka malihini.” [ ]","When Kakuhihewa heard Lonoikamakahiki’s response to the name of his cousin, Kakuhihewa remarked: “Lonoikamakahiki is chanting somebody else’s name instead of his own.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “It is done. I am going to recite it, but I must first weep with the stranger.” [ ]"
"Ia manawa, hele mai la o Kaikilani a honi i ka ihu o Lonoikamakahiki, a uwe iho la. A no ka hoolale pinepine mai o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki e hana i ka inoa o ua o Lonoikamakahiki, alaila, ninau aku la o Kaikilani ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha kela a lakou la e olelo pinepine mai nei ia oe e hana ae?” I aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “E olelo mai ana lakou la ia’u e hana wau i kuu inoa, no ka mea, ua olelo o Lanahuimihaku ma, he alii inoa ole au.” I aku o Kaikilani: “Uoki ka uwe a kaua, hana ia aku ka lakou la koi.” Alaila, haliu aku la o Lonoikamakahiki a kahea aku la imua o ka aha i kona inoa, a hana pu aku la no hoi me Kaikilani. Oia kela mele maluna ae.","Kaikilani then came in and kissed Lonoikamakahiki and they wept. Seeing that Kakuhihewa was constantly urging Lonoikamakahiki to chant the name of Lonoikamakahiki, she asked of Lonoikamakahiki: “What is it that they are constantly urging you to do?” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “They are telling me to chant my name, because Lanahuimihaku and his companion have said that I am a chief without a chant in honor of my name.” Kaikilani then said: “Let us cease weeping and do as they request.” Lonoikamakahiki then faced about and recited to the people the chant in honor of his name, while Kaikilani joined him. The chant is the one already related above."
"A pau ka Lonoikamakahiki ma hana ana i ua inoa nei ona, alaila, olelo aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “He oi olua o na kanaka lapuwale nui wale. No’u paha auanei ka noho a lilo ia’u keia moku o Oahu nei, koli ola ia olua e a’u.”","At the close of the chant by Lonoikamakahiki and Kaikilani, Lonoikamakahiki then said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “You two men are the worst of any I have known. If during my visit here I shall get a hold of this island of Oahu, I will cut you to pieces while alive. ”"
"O ka hoopapa ana a ke alii o Oahu me ke alii o Hawaii, i olelo ia ma keia mokuna, o keia ka laua hoopapa hope loa, a hoi pu aku la o Lonoikamakahiki me Kaikilani i Hawaii.","The dispute between the king of Oahu and the king of Hawaii which ended in a contest, spoken of in this chapter, was the last one engaged in by the two, after which Lonoikamakahiki and Kaikilani returned together to Hawaii."
"O ke kumu o keia hoopapa, no Hauna wale no; no ka mea, mahope iho o ka lilo ana o Oahu ia Lonoikamakahiki ma na pili mua ana, ua noi mai o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki, e hoihoi hou o Oahu iaia; a penei ka Kakuhihewa olelo: “E ke alii o Hawaii, e aho e hoihoi ka aina ia’u, a e hoopau kela pili mua, ame kela eo mua ana. E noonoo hou mai oe i kumu hoopapa hou na kaua, a ina e eo wau ma ke kumu hoopapa hope, alaila, lilo pau loa o Oahu nei ia oe, mai kanaka nui a kanaka liilii.”","The cause of this dispute was entirely about Hauna. It came about in this wise: After Lonoikamakahiki had acquired Oahu through their former contests, Kakuhihewa begged of Lonoikamakahiki to restore to him the island of Oahu, going about it in a way as though he still owned the island, saying: “Say, King of Hawaii, I think you had better restore back to me the lands you have won and let our former wagers be done away with. I think you ought to propose another contest between us, and in case you should beat me in the new contest then the whole of Oahu shall be yours, including the men of high rank and those of the low rank.”"
"O keia olelo ana a Kakuhihewa pela, no Lanahuimihaku ma, no ka mea, ua olelo o Lonoikamakahiki, e koli ola ia Lanahuimihaku ma. A oia wale no ke kumu i olelo aku ai ua o Lanahuimihaku ia Kakuhihewa, e noi aku ia Lonoikamakahiki e imi hou i kumu hoopapa; aka, aole nae o Lonoikamakahiki i hai aku i kumu hoopapa na laua.","This request for a new contest, made by Kakuhihewa, was really the wish of Lanahuimihaku and his companion, for they had heard the remark made by Lonoikamakahiki that they would be put to death by being cut to pieces. This is the reason why Lanahuimihaku and his companion had urged Kakuhihewa to beg of Lonoikamakahiki for a new contest. To this request made by Kakuhihewa, Lonoikamakahiki did not give a subject for their contest."
"Aka, mahope koke iho oia wa no, lawe ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i kona hokeo a ku imua o kona alo, a olelo aku la ia Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Oahu nei, o keia hokeo la, ua piha i ka iwi o na ’lii i make i ke kaua i luna o Puumaneo, no ka mea, eono alii aimoku i make i ke kaua a kuu makuakane e waiho nei i loko o ka hokeo.” [ ]","Shortly after this, however, Lonoikamakahiki took up his calabash, which contained his personal effects as well as other things, and placed it in front of him, and then said to Kakuhihewa: “Say, King of Oahu, this calabash is filled with the bones of the chiefs who were killed in the battle on the top of Puumaneo, because there were six district chiefs that were slain by my father and their bones are in this calabash.” [ ]"
"Olelo aku la o Kakuhihewa: “Wahahee wale! Owai kai ao mai ia oe, he pau na ’lii eono iloko o na hokeo?” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Owau no. Aia apopo hiki mai kuu makuakane o Hauna, nana e hai aku ia oukou.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “A nawai mai nei hoi na olelo au e puka mai ana o Hauna i ka la apopo?” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Na’u no, a na kuu ike.” Ia manawa ninau ae la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ea, he oiaio anei kela a ke alii o Hawaii e olelo mai la, he ike kona; a e hiki io mai ana anei o Hauna i ka la apopo?” I aku o Lanahuimihaku: “He wahahee, nawai kona ike; o maua no paha kona mau kanaka ike, mai kona makuakane mai, a o ua o Hauna e noho mai la i Hawaii; a o ke kahu no ona i pepehi ai ia kakou i kai, pau ae la no na kanaka ike; a o ua alii la ea he ole loa.” I hou aku o Kakuhihewa: “He oiaio, e puka mai ana anei o Hauna i ka la apopo?” I aku ua o Lanahuimihaku ma: “He wahahee. Piliia aku.”","Kakuhihewa upon hearing this said: “How you deceive! Who has taught you that that calabash could ever hold the bones of six chiefs?” Lonoikamakahiki said: “I say it. Tomorrow my foster-father Hauna will arrive and he will tell you people about the matter.” Kakuhihewa then said to him: “And who has brought you word that Hauna is to arrive tomorrow?” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “I, myself, say so because of my knowledge.” Kakuhihewa then asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Say, are the words spoken by the king of Hawaii true, that he can see the future and that Hauna is to arrive tomorrow?” Lanahuimihaku replied: “It is a lie; he has no knowledge of the future. We were the two men who were able to tell him of the future from the time of his father, and this Hauna, who is living on Hawaii, and the attendant whom he killed when we were out fishing were the only men who could tell of the future; but the king there knows nothing at all about the matter.” Kakuhihewa then again asked: “Is it true that Hauna is going to arrive here tomorrow?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “It is not true. Make a wager with him.”"
"I aku o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki: “E ke alii o Hawaii-e. He nani ia ua loaa ae la ka kaua kumu hoopapa o Hauna, o kona hiki mai i ka la apopo.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Auhea kau kumu e pili ai? I ku hoi nei mea o ka pili i ka loaa o ke kumu e pili mai ai.” I mai o Kakuhihewa: “Kai noa no hoi o Oahu nei no a mau ia Hawaii?” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Aia ka a lilo o Oahu nei ia’u, pili mai no?” I hou mai o Kakuhihewa: “Alia hoi ia manao ou e ke alii o Hawaii. Kai noa o Oahu iki ka kaua i pili iho nei, koe no o Oahu nui?” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua pono. Ma na moku okana nae ka pili, eono moku o Oahu nei, eono no hoi o Hawaii.” A holo ae la ka laua olelo, ia po iho hiki ae la o Hauna i Kailua, a ao ae, hai aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kakuhihewa: “Ua hiki ae la o Hauna eia i Oahu nei.”","Kakuhihewa then said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Say, King of Hawaii, since we have at last found a subject for another contest—the matter of the arrival of Hauna tomorrow—let us, therefore, have one.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “What have you to offer as your wager? A good contest can only be made when one has something to place as a wager.” Kakuhihewa said: “Why not let Oahu be offered as against Hawaii?” Lonoikamakahiki made answer: “When you know that I have already won Oahu you come and again offer it for a wager.” Kakuhihewa said: “You must put away such thoughts, King of Hawaii. It was the small Oahu that we wagered before, and large Oahu is still my own.” Lonoikamakahiki then replied: “It is well, then. The stakes are the island districts. Oahu containing six districts and Hawaii also containing six.” After this bet was made and agreed on, that night Hauna arrived in Kailua, and so the next morning Lonoikamakahiki said to Kakuhihewa: “Hauna has arrived on Oahu.”"
"A lohe o Kakuhihewa i keia olelo a Lonoikamakahiki, alaila, kena ae la oia i kana elele ia Kuleonui, he kanaka kaulana oia i ka mama, a olelo aku la: “E hele oe e nana a puni o Oahu nei, a ina i ike oe ia Hauna, alaila e pepehi iho, a hao ae i ka waiwai, i eo ke alii o Hawaii ia kakou.” Alaila holo ae la o Kuleonui a puni o Oahu nei; aole i loaa o Hauna. Hoi aku la, a olelo aku la ia Kakuhihewa: “Hele aku nei wau a puni o Oahu nei, aole i loaa o Hauna, aole no i puka mai, aole he waa holo mai ma ka moana, aole no hoi he waa hekau i ke kai, aole he waa kau i uka, he ole loa no.” Ia manawa i manao ai o Kakuhihewa, e eo ana o Lonoikamakahiki. Alaila, hele aku la o Kakuhihewa a olelo aku ia Lonoikamakahiki, me ka ninau aku: “Ua hiki mai nei anei o Hauna?” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua hiki ae la.”","When Kakuhihewa heard these words from Lonoikamakahiki, he sent out his messenger, Kuleonui, a man famous for being a very fast runner, and told him: “You must go around Oahu and look for Hauna. When you find him, kill him, and seize all his property, so that we may be able to defeat the king of Hawaii.” At this Kuleonui started on his trip around the island of Oahu; but he was unable to find Hauna. He therefore returned and reported to Kakuhihewa, saying: “I have made a circuit of Oahu but was unable to find Hauna. He has not arrived even, nor is there a canoe to be seen at sea coming this way, nor is there one hauled up on the shore; none at all.” At this Kakuhihewa began to think that he would beat Lonoikamakahiki. Kakuhihewa then went to Lonoikamakahiki and again asked him: “Has Hauna arrived?” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “He has arrived.”"
"Lohe ae la no o Kakuhihewa i keia olelo a Lonoikamakahiki, kena hou aku la no ia Kuleonui, e holo a puni o Oahu. Alaila, holo hou aku la no, a hoi aku la, hai aku la i ke alii, me ka hoole aku: “Aole i loaa, aole no i hiki mai.” E like no me kana olelo mua. [ ]","When Kakuhihewa heard this from Lonoikamakahiki, he again sent Kuleonui to make another circuit of Oahu. Again Kuleonui started out and returned to the king to whom he reported, saying: “I have not found him. He has not even arrived,” repeating what he said at the other time. [ ]"
"Aka, ma ke kaapuni mua ana a Kuleonui i ua la la, ua hiki mua ae o Hauna ma Kailua, e konane ana me na wahine; ike aku nae o Hauna ia Kuleonui e holo ana, me ka alawa o na maka, mao a mao, i ike aku ai oia i kona mea i hoounaia mai ai, aole nae oia i ike aku ia Hauna, aka, o Hauna kai ike mua aku ia Kuleonui, a nolaila oia i pee ai, a pakele aku la i na maka o ka elele a Kakuhihewa.","But, on the first circuit made by Kuleonui on that day, Hauna had already arrived in Kailua and was playing konane with a couple of women when Kuleonui came by, and was recognized by Hauna as a person out looking for some one, by the way he was glancing around. By this, Hauna knew that Kuleonui was a messenger and was able to conceal his identity and was in this way missed by the sharp eyes of the messenger of Kakuhihewa."
"Ia Hauna e noho ana i Hawaii, manao ae la oia e imi mai ia Lonoikamakahiki, a nolaila, hoomakaukau ae la oia i na ukana a pau e hooili maluna o kona mau waa. A ka ukana nui o luna o na waa o Hauna, he ahuula. Ua hoopihaia na waa mai mua a hope i ka ahuula, a oia hookahi no ka ukana.","While Hauna was living on Hawaii he thought he would come in search of Lonoikamakahiki, so he therefore made ready his personal effects and placed them in his canoes. The chief articles of value that Hauna placed on the canoes, however, were a large number of feather cloaks. The canoes were loaded from stem to stern with these articles. These were the only things in the canoes."
"Ia holo ana mai mai Hawaii mai a kau ma Kailua, ike aku la oia e konane ana elua wahine me ka laua mau kane. Ia ike ana aku a Hauna, ua honu ka papa konane, alaila, i aku o Hauna: “Ua make olua, ina owau ko olua hoa konane, make olua ia’u.” I mai ua mau wahine la: “Eia mai no hoi ka papa konane, konane mai.” I aku o Hauna: “Alia kakou e konane, aia a hala aku ka elele a Kakuhihewa, alaila, konane kakou; e pono nae ke uhi i ke kapa ka papa konane, alaila, olelo ka pili mamua, a holo, alaila konane.”","On this voyage from Hawaii he made land at Kailua, where he saw a couple of women playing konane with their husbands. When Hauna saw the game he knew at once by the position of the stones that the men were beaten, so he said to the women: “You two are beaten, providing I was to play you women. I know I can beat you two.” The women replied: “Here is the konane board, go ahead and play.” Hauna said: “Let us delay the game for a while until the messenger of Kakuhihewa passes by; after he passes we will continue with the game. We must, however, cover up the board with a piece of kapa; after that we can discuss as to our wagers, and when that is settled we will begin.”"
"A hala aku la o Kuleonui, olelo ae la lakou no ka pili, a hooholo ae la lakou. A penei ka pili ana. Olelo mai na wahine ia Hauna: “Aole a maua kumu e ae e pili aku ai, o na kino wale no o maua, a ina no hoi ua make maua ia oe ma ka hauna o ka papa mua, alaila, lilo no hoi maua nau.” I aku la o Hauna: “He mau waa kaulua ko’u elua, ua piha i ka waiwai; o ka waiwai nui nae o luna, he ahuula, a ina i make wau ia olua, no olua ka waa ame ka ukana o luna apau, a me na kanaka pu o luna.” I mai la na wahine: “Ua mau.” Olelo aku la o Hauna: “Ia’u ka uhau mua i koe.”","After Kuleonui had passed the place the bet was discussed and agreed on in the following manner: the women said to Hauna: “We have nothing to offer on our side excepting ourselves. If you beat us in this present unfinished game you can take us as your property.” Hauna then said: “I have two double canoes filled with things that are valuable; the chief articles of value on the canoes, however, are a large number of feather cloaks. If you two beat me, you two shall have the goods in the canoes together with the men on board.” The women replied: “It is a bet.” Hauna then said: “Let me make the first move.”"
"He oiaio, ma ko lakou hahau mua ana, mamua o ko lakou pili ana, a me ka uhi ana i ke kapa, ua maopopo ia Hauna e make ana oia; aka, no ka ike ana aku ia Kuleonui, nolaila, oia i olelo ai, alia e uhau a hala aku ka elele a Kakuhihewa, e uhi ia ka papa i ke kapa. Aka i ka hoomaka ana e lawe ae i ke kapa, lilo pu ae la me ka iliili a na wahine i ike ai he maikai, ma ka lima o Hauna. Alaila, hahau ae la o Hauna, a make iho la na wahine. I aku la o Hauna: “Ua lilo olua ia’u.” I aku ua mau wahine nei: “He mau kane ka maua, pehea la auanei maua e pono ai?” I aku na kane: “Aole a olua olelo kuhikuhi no maua, no ka mea, ua lilo olua.” Alaila kahea ae la na kane a ua mau wahine la ia Hauna: “Lawe ia na wahine nau, ua eo ia oe, no ka mea, aole na hai aku ka laua mea i pili ai, na laua no.” [ ]","It was a fact that before the game was continued, and before the bets were settled and the board covered with the piece of kapa, Hauna knew very well that he was beaten; but upon seeing Kuleonui it gave him an excuse to propose that the board be covered over until the messenger of Kakuhihewa passed by. According to his request the board was covered over. But when the kapa was removed, in order to continue the game, Hauna caught up some of the stones which gave the women the best advantage with the kapa. Hauna then made the first move and after a few more moves the women were beaten. At this he said: “I have won you two.” The women replied: “We have husbands of our own and we cannot see how we can straighten out this difficulty.” The husbands of the two women replied: “You two had better not consider us, because you made your own bet and have lost it yourselves.” The husbands then said to Hauna: “You can take the women as your own property, for you have won them; they were not staked by others; they made the bet themselves.” [ ]"
"A no ia mea, lalau aku la o Hauna i na wahine a nakii ae la i ka malo i kekahi wahine ame kekahi wahine, a kauo aku la i kahi a na waa e kau ana. A no ia kauo ana o Hauna i na wahine, nolaila, ua kapaia ka inoa o kela wahi o Kaohao, ma Kailua, Koolaupoko, Oahu, a hiki mai i keia la.","Because of this Hauna took the women and tied them together with a loin cloth and led them to the place where the canoes were lying. Because these women were led by Hauna, the place where this act took place was given the name of Kaohao and it so remains to this day. The place is in Kailua, Koolaupoko, Oahu."
"Hele pu aku la ua mau wahine nei me Hauna a hiki i na waa, olelo aku la i kekahi wahine: “Eia kou waa a me na ukana o luna mai mua a hope, a eia kou mau kanaka, he mau kanaka lawelawe nou; aole he mau kanaka moe aku nau.” A e like me ka olelo i kela wahine, pela no ka ia nei olelo ana i ka lua o ka wahine. A haalele iho la oia i na wahine, a hele aku la e halawai me Lonoikamakahiki.","The women were taken by Hauna to the canoes where he said to one of them: “This canoe shall be yours with everything in it from stem to stern, including the men. The men shall be your servants; they are not for you to sleep with. ” And as he had spoken to her, so in like manner he spoke to the second woman. He then left the women and proceeded to meet Lonoikamakahiki."
"A hiki aku la o Hauna a halawai me Lonoikamakahiki, i aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ina e hiki ole mai nei oe i keia la, o ka pau no ia o’u i kalua, eia la ua makaukau ka umu no’u.” I aku o Hauna: “Ua eo ia oe, hoike ia aku na iwi o na ’lii i make i ke kaua i ka wa o ko makuakane o Keawenuiaumi.”","When Hauna went up to meet Lonoikamakahiki, Lonoikamakahiki said to him: “If you had not arrived this day I would have been cooked in the umu, for it is now ready.” Hauna replied: “You have won. Show them the bones of the chiefs killed in the battle in the time of your father, Keawenuiaumi. ”"
"Ia manawa, lalau ae la o Hauna i na iwi o ko Kohala alii, ua hakuia i ka hulu, ua kamaahaia a paa, a olelo aku la ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Eia keia alii o Palahalaha, ko Kohala alii, ka Wohilani keiki.

He had been residing with us, and seeing how few we were, left, and at your father’s battle on Puumaneo died at our hands. We secured the bones and put them away in the gourd container.” At this time Lonoikamakahiki seized them and threw them in front of Kakuhihewa and began chanting:"
"Palahalaha wale Ka moe a Kohala, I lalo ke alo. Ehuehu mai ana ia’u, Ka pua o Koolau, o Moolau. Kai mai ana ka waiho a Puakea, Kakaako ana Kukuipahu.

He resided with Keawenuiaumi, and seeing how few we were, left, and at the battle of Keawenuiaumi on Puumaneo we slew him. He was also a younger brother (cousin) of Keawenuiaumi. Kohala is a beautiful country and is a large district.” [ ]"

He lived with us, and having learnt that we were few in number, deserted, and at our battle at Puumaneo he was slain by Keawenuiaumi.

He lived with us, and ascertaining how few we were, went away, and at the battle fought on Puumaneo was slain by Keawenuiaumi. His bones were stripped, put away in the container, and this is he.” [ ]"

Lanahuimihaku and the others answered: “This is Lililehua, the chief of Puna, the child of Hua-a. He had a beautiful country where even the pandanus and the lehua enter the sea, being the only sweet-scented land on Hawaii. This chief had his home with us; a younger brother (cousin) of Keawenuiaumi, but knowing our numerical weakness, deserted us, and at the battle fought on Puumaneo we slew him, stripped all his bones, put them in a container, and this is he.”"

He is also an uncle (father) of yours and a younger cousin (brother) of Keawenuiaumi. He also lived with us, and seeing how few we were, deserted, and at the battle of Puumaneo was slain by Keawenuiaumi. We secured his bones and put them away in the gourd.”"
"Alaila, lawe ae la o Lonoikamakahiki a paa ma ka lima, alaila oli aku la:","Lonoikamakahiki, holding the bones in his hands, chanted:"

He was also a younger brother (cousin) of your father. He lived with us, and because we were few, deserted and went elsewhere; he rebelled against Keawenuiaumi, and at your father’s battle on Puumaneo was also slain, the bones stripped and put into the gourd.”"
"Alaila, lawe ae la o Lonoikamakahiki a paa ma ka lima, a oli aku la:","Lonoikamakahiki, holding the bones in his hands, chanted thus:"

They answered: “This is Moihala, the chief of Kona, a large division of Hawaii. Moihala was also a younger brother (cousin) of Keawenuiaumi. He resided with us, and finding out how few we were, left, went to the opposite side, a rebel. He thought by rebelling he would be safe, but when putting in an appearance at our battle at Puumaneo he was slain by Keawenuiaumi.”"
"Ma keia hoike hope ana a Lonoikamakahiki i ko Kona alii, o ka pau loa no hoi ia o Oahu nei ia Lonoikamakahiki.

Following this incident, Lonoikamakahiki spoke to Kaikilani: “Inasmuch as we have made the circuit of Oahu, you, of us, had better remain; it is good land, with inhabitants both large and small.” Kaikilani answered: “It is agreeable to me; but we had better go to put Hawaii on a satisfactory basis, then return again to Oahu. There are the chiefs of Hawaii; they have rebelled and have confiscated everything. As for yourself, upon arriving at Hawaii, wage battle, as the men have been thickly arrayed from Anaehoomalu to the front of Kauhola.”"
"A no keia olelo ana aku a Kaikilani pela, hoolale koke ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i na waa, a holo aku la lakou.

Upon arrival there with his men, the chiefs of Kona and the men were all at Kohala awaiting the arrival of Lonoikamakahiki there to be slaughtered by them. Upon Lonoikamakahiki’s arrival he sent a messenger to Kau to get Pupuakea to come to meet his elder brother (Lonoikamakahiki) to consult concerning putting to an end the rebellious chiefs of Hawaii.

Pupuakea then sent a messenger calling upon all the men to come to do battle. Kau was the only district which had not rebelled, because Pupuakea took up his residence there after Lonoikamakahiki departed for Oahu. The men having been informed, came over by the upper part of Kau to upper Kona, but the messenger that was sent reached Kealakekua, where Lonoikamakahiki and Pupuakea were living. After receiving the information that the men had come overland, Lonoikamakahiki and Pupuakea went to intercept them at Puuanahulu , and that was the place where the men were arrayed in battle formation. About this time, however, the rebels who were down at Anaehoomalu observed that the clinkers at Puuanahulu were red with people, which was a matter of surprise to the rebels. Some of them thought there was a battle being fought, while others conjectured they were some of their own men, being under the impression that Lonoikamakahiki was still at Oahu, for no news had been received that he, Lonoikamakahiki, had arrived at Kealakekua."

On the night the men left Puuanahulu to go down, the rebels realized there was to be war, because there were in the hands of the men torches burning from the van to the rear of the war procession of Lonoikamakahiki. Then it was that the rebels made preparations for battle, sending out messengers to inform the men and the chiefs on their side that had been stationed from Anaehoomalu to distant Kohala."
"Aka ia Lonoikamakahiki ma i iho mai ai, halawai mua iho la me na kipi i Wailea, a o ka hoouka koke iho la no ia o ke kaua, a pau iho la na kipi i ka lukuia, a lanakila ae la o Lonoikamakahiki ma ia hoouka kaua ana.

Lonoikamakahiki was victorious on this occasion and the rebels were annihilated. This was the battle fought by Lonoikamakahiki, where it is said that blood flowed like water at Wainanalii, and hence the battle is described as that of Kaheawai."
"Mahope iho o ke kaua a Lonoikamakahiki i Kaheawai, ma ke kakahiaka nui, ike ia mai la o Lonoikamakahiki e ka aoao kipi e hele aku ana i ke a o Kaniku, alaila, hoi aku la na kanaka o ka aoao kipi a hai aku la i ko lakou pukaua (Alihikaua) ia Kanaloapulehu, me ka i aku: “Eia’e o Lonoikamakahiki me Pupuakea ma, ua pau mai nei kekahi poe i ka make ua hee mai nei kakou (na kipi).”","Early in the morning after the battle of Lonoikamakahiki at Kaheawai, he was observed by the rebels proceeding along the lava bed of Kaniku. The rebels after returning to camp reported to their general, Kanaloapulehu, saying: “Lonoikamakahiki and Pupuakea are approaching, some men have been slain, and we (the rebels) have been routed.”"
"Nolaila, olelo ae la o Kanaloapulehu ia Kanaloakuakawaiea ko Hilo alii: “Ho aku ke kaua i Kaunooa i ke one nui, i hoouka ai ke kaua ilaila, i hiki ae ai ia o Lonoikamakahiki ilaila, ua paa mua ia kakou ke one, na lakou ia e hele ae, kanu mai ke one i na maka, lilo lakou ilaila e anaanai ai hao aku na pohaku, o ka lanakila no ia.”","Kanaloapulehu commanded Kanaloakuakawaiea, the chief of Hilo: “Let the battle be at Kaunooa where there is plenty of sand, and let it be fought there, so that when Lonoikamakahiki reaches the spot we would be in possession of the sand, so that whilst rubbing their eyes the rocks will fly and victory will be ours.”"
"E like me ka olelo a Kanaloapulehu ia Kanaloakuakawaiea, alaila, laweia aku la na kanaka o ka aoao kipi a hoonoho ma Kaunooa (aia no kela wahi mawaena o Puako a me Kawaihae).

This is a place midway between Puako and Kawaihae. At the noon hour Lonoikamakahiki came in contact with the rebels and the battle commenced in earnest and he was victorious over them, having repulsed Kanaloapulehu and his followers just as the shades of evening were falling. [ ]"
"Ia Kanaloapulehu ma i hee aku ai me na kipi, loaa aku la ko Kohala poe kipi mai a me ko Hamakua mai ma kahi i kapaia o Nakikiaianihau.

Kanaloapulehu commanded them, saying: “Let us go back and encamp at Haleokapuni, and let some of us go on to Puukohola, and when Lonoikamakahiki is seen approaching Nakikiaianihau, then we will occupy Puukohola so we can shower rocks from above and Lonoikamakahiki’s battle will be a defeat.” All the chiefs observed the commands of the general and encamped at Haleokapuni immediately below the temple of Puukohola and Mailekini at Kawaihae. Lonoikamakahiki, however, did not manoeuver as was anticipated by the rebels."
"Mahope iho o ko Lonoikamakahiki lanakila ana i ke kaua ma Kaunooa, alaila, ninau ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i kana mau kahuna i kahi e hiki ai ke hele a lanakila.

The priests directed him to proceed by way of Pili until they came to Puupa, “and there a big battle should be fought, because thus far we have only fought against the Konas, and know nothing about Hilo and Puna, nor of Hamakua. Pay no heed to Kohala, it is a small district; let us fight her last. Proceed against the triplets, Puna, Hilo and Hamakua.”"
"Ia pii ana a Lonoikamakahiki ma mai Kaunooa aku, a waena pili, ma ke aumoe, ike aku la lakou i ke ahi a na kipi e a mai ana i Puupa.

Proceeding upwards from Kaunooa and about midway of the plains at about midnight they could see the fires of the rebels at Puupa. Lonoikamakahiki asked his priests: “What is that fire?” The priests answered: “A battle. It is the fires of the traitors of the land.” He asked again: “What of us?” The kahunas answered: “Send along forty men with torches in their hands, each man to carry four torches to burn, so as to deceive and to give the rebels the impression that there are four forty men, allowing them to proceed directly and when immediately outside of Puupa permit them to light their torches so we may be able to locate the whereabouts of the enemy and learn where they are encamped, the battle to begin at once, we to follow them from the rear and the forty from the opposite direction, and the enemy will be routed.”"
"Ia manawa a ke kahuna i olelo ai, hoouna aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i hookahi kanaha kanaka me Pupuakea pu, oia ke kanaha kumamakahi.

They followed the instructions of the priests, each man carrying four torches, proceeding along the direction indicated by the priests. They travelled along to the outskirts of the camp of the rebels, lighted their four forty torches and set up a tremendous shouting, “Onto the traitors of the land! Onto the traitors of the land!” and such like."
"A ike ae la na kipi i na lama e a ana, a me na leo hooho, a helu aku la lakou (na kipi) i ka nui o na lama, pakahi, ua like me eha kanaha, a alualu aku la.

After first counting the number of torches and discovering there were only four forties the rebels gave chase. While the rebels were absent Lonoikamakahiki and his men arrived, and in the fight with Pupuakea’s men, who gained by repulsing the rebels, Lonoikamakahiki and his army stood off ready to receive them. The battle waxed fierce and hard until the two divisions of Lonoikamakahiki and Pupuakea came together, when there was great [ ] slaughter of the rebels. Some escaping, ran upwards to Ouli at Waimea that night and were there slain by their own men being under the impression that they were Lonoikamakahiki’s men running away. Thereby the remaining rebels who escaped from the battle of Puupa were also killed. It is for this reason that this fight of Lonoikamakahiki’s was called Puupa, and was the third of his battles."
"Ma ke ao ana ae, i kela po i hoouka kaua ai ma Puupa, kui aku la ka lono i na wahi e ae, aia o Lonoikamakahiki i Puupa; nolaila, o ka poe e hoomoana ana ma Haleokapuni i Kawaihae, a e like hoi me ka manao mua o ka poe e hoomoana ana ma Haleokapuni, aole lakou e pii iluna o Puukohola, aia a make kekahi kanaka o ko Lonoikamakahiki aoao, alaila pii ia o Puukohola no ka hai kanaka.

Those who were encamped at Haleokapuni in Kawaihae, in accordance with a previous understanding had by them, would not ascend Puukohola unless a man on the side of Lonoikamakahiki should be slain; then only would Puukohola be scaled for human sacrifices. For that reason the rebels rested with high hopes, based on their former understanding and anticipations of victory, because Kanaloapulehu and Kanaloakuakawaiea were celebrated for their great prowess."
"Aka ma kekahi po, hiki aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i Kawaihae me kona puali, a o ko Pupuakea puali hoi iho ia ae a ma Nakikiaianihau , hoaiai ia mai.

Paa iho la o Kanaloapulehu ia po a ao, pepehiia iho la, a kau ia aku la i ka lele. Pela i make ai ka pukaua o na kipi.","On the night following Lonoikamakahiki arrived at Kawaihae with his force of men, and Pupuakea’s force came by way of Nakikiaianihau , and revealed themselves. Kanaloapulehu, seeing the force of Pupuakea, sent out four hundred men to give him battle. At the same time that the men were on the way to intercept Pupuakea, Lonoikamakahiki had taken possession of Puukohola by a strategic move made during the night and was occupying the top of it. Immediately the battle commenced, and Kanaloapulehu was afterwards made prisoner by Lonoikamakahiki’s warriors, and Kanaloakuakawaiea was repulsed with what was remaining of the rebels, Lonoikamakahiki being the victor that night, recording the fourth night battle won by him. This battle of Lonoikamakahiki at Puukohola was named the Kawaluna, because of the night strategy successfully executed by him on that occasion. Kanaloapulehu, having been made prisoner, was killed and laid upon the altar (lele). So died the general of the rebels."
"Mahope iho o ka lanakila ana o Lonoikamakahiki i ka hoouka kaua ana ma Puukohola, hee aku la o Kanalaokuakawaiea, ka pukaua nui i koe o na kipi aina; hee aku la a noho i luna o Puainako. (Aia kela oioina ma ka akau ae o Kawaihae, aneane eha mile mai Kawaihae aku).","After the victory by Lonoikamakahiki at the battle of Puukohola and the repulse of Kanaloakuakawaiea, the remaining great general of the traitors was forced to the top of Puainako. That eminence is about four miles to the north of Kawaihae."
"Ma ua po hoouka kaua la i Puukohola, ma ke kakahiaka ana ae, mahope iho hoi o ka pau ana o ka hai kanaka (Kanaloapulehu) ma Puukohola, ia manawa hoomaka aku la ka Lonoikamakahiki poe kaua e hele; aka ua hiki mua aku la o Pupuakea me kana poe kaua i ka pali o Honokoa i ka manawa poeleele o ke kakahiaka nui, me ka manao e loaa aku ke pio, aka, aole he pio i loaa aku; nolaila hoi hope mai la ua o Pupuakea, a loaa o Lonoikamakahiki e iho mai ana i Pahonu, akahi no a hui na puali elua; ka Pupuakea me ka Lonoikamakahiki.

Pupuakea and his men, however, had already arrived at the precipice of Honokoa during the darkness of early morning with the intention of capturing prisoners, but none were captured, however. So Pupuakea returned and met Lonoikamakahiki descending at Pahonu. The two divisions of Pupuakea and Lonoikamakahiki were then brought together again. They then held a consultation as to the direction they should take. Pupuakea and Lonoikamakahiki desired to go by way of Waimea, but the wish of the priest, Hauna, was to proceed by the Kohala route to Puumaneo and there make preparation for battle. Lonoikamakahiki heeded the advice of the priest. [ ]"
"Ma ia hooholo ana, hele aku la lakou mai Kawaihae aku, a hiki i ka pali o Honokoa, a kau maluna o ka aoao ma Kohala; ia manawa, ike aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i ka meheu wawae o na kipi, alaila hoomaka hou aku la ka lanakila e huli i ka meheu, aia nae e ahu ana na meheu he nui, ua mae ke pili.

At that moment Lonoikamakahiki noticed the footprints of the rebels, and the victors began to search for more traces and they were innumerable, as indicated by the withered pili grass. Lonoikamakahiki’s forces followed the trodden path and lo! there were the rebels in large numbers encamped at Puainako. The rebels having first seen the forces of approaching men made their escape in every direction. However, before the final understanding had been reached at Puhaukole, Pupuakea already had dispatched a messenger to investigate the condition of the rebels who were repulsed at the battle of Puukohola."
"A ma keia ukali ana a Lonoikamakahiki ma, halawai mua mai la me ka elele i hoounaia aku ai. Olelo mai la ua elele la: “Aia ke pio ke auhee la i ke pili.” Nolaila, alualu aku la ka lanakila mahope o ke pio, halawai aku la lakou ma kahakai o Kahua, a luku aku la o Pupuakea i na kipi mai ke pili aku a hiki ma kahakai, auhee aku la, a puehu liilii aku la ma o a ma o.

The conquerors gave chase, meeting them on the beach at Kahua, when Pupuakea slaughtered them on the pili grass as well as at the beach, their repulse having scattered them in every direction. As for Kanaloakuakawaiea, he fled to the canoe landing and ordered the men to cover him with pebbles; the covering was only partial, however. Lonoikamakahiki and his men soon arrived upon the scene and Kanaloakuakawaiea was there slain."
"A ike mai la na kanaka o Hilo, ua make ko lakou alii, hoomake pu mai la na makaainana mamuli ona, a luku aku la ka lanakila a pau loa kekahi mau kipi, a o kekahi poe kipi, inana aku la lakou maluna o ke aa o na kahakai o Kahua, mehe opae la ka pohaku kahawai, a nolaila kahea mai o Pupuakea:","When the men of Hilo heard that their chief was killed, they also offered themselves to be slain with him. The victors slaughtered a large number of them. Some of them scrambled over the clinkers along the beach at Kahua, like shrimps clinging to the rocks in a stream. Then it was that Pupuakea chanted:"
"Ke hee la ka hoi e hee ai, Ke pio la ka hoi e pio ai, Ka ua pio kipi aina, Ke inana la ka hoi, Mehe opae oehaa la; I luna ke aa haoa E kala ka hee, Ua kaheawai ke kaua, Ke kaua kuehu one i Kaunooa, Ke kawa po i Puupa, I kaua huli moku i Kawaluna, Hee honua kipi aina I ka ehu makani o ka laau Hai kanaka nae hoi, Lono-e He lanakila-la Lanakila nae hoi Lono, E na ’lii hana ino o lakou-e!","Routed, are you, indeed you are routed! Beaten, are you, indeed you are beaten! You treasonable land pirates; You are scattered about, are you, Like water shrimps, Onto the rocks in the stream. You were routed sometime ago, For the battle was like a freshet, The battle in the shower of sand at Kaunooa, The night battle at Puupa. In the general war at Kawaluna The land pirates were easily defeated, Merely by the wind from the war clubs. Men are sacrificed indeed, by Lono. It was a victory. Lono was victorious, You treasonable chiefs!"
"Ua kapaia keia kaua a Lonoikamakahiki, Kaiopae, a nolaila, ua kapaia ka inoa o ia awa pae waa mamuli o ia kaua, a o kona inoa mau ia a hiki i keia la.","This battle of Lonoikamakahiki’s was called Kaiopae, and the landing place was named after this battle and is known as such to this day."
"Mahope iho o keia pio ana i ke kaua ma Kaiopae, hele aku la ka lanakila a hiki i Kohala. Ia lakou nae i hiki aku ai, e hoopaa mai ana ke kaua a na kipi i Hinakahua, ma Kapaau i Kohala.

Upon their arrival there the rebels were in a state of preparedness for war at Hinakahua, in Kapaau of Kohala. The rebels observed the victors approaching on the highlands [ ] in inferior numbers, and because of the enemy’s numerical weakness, mustered courage to give battle to the forces of Lonoikamakahiki; but upon the near approach of the conquerors the rebels fled without any apparent reason, slaughtering each other in their confusion, fleeing to hide themselves among the precipices of Pololu and Honokane."
"A Halelua, loaa aku la na kipi ilaila, a luku ia iho la e Pupuakea me kana laau palau. A make iho la ko Kohala pukaua o Kaiopihi, a lanakila ae la o Lonoikamakahiki ma ia kaua ana.

Kaiopihi, the Kohala general was slain, and Lonoikamakahiki once more was victorious at this battle. This battle of Lonoikamakahiki was named Kaiopihi after the incident of the death of Kaiopihi at that place, the locality being known by that name to this day."
"Mahope iho o keia kaua, hoi aku la o Lonoikamakahiki a noho mauka o Pololu, maluna o kela puu kaua i oleloia o Puumaneo, e like me ke kuhikuhi a Hauna, kona kahu a kahuna hoi.

While located on Puumaneo, reinforcements of rebels from Hamakua, Hilo, Puna and Kona arrived. Lonoikamakahiki gained a complete victory, and there it was that all the rebellious chiefs were slaughtered, not one escaping death. Thus Lonoikamakahiki came into control of the whole of Hawaii."
"Mahope iho o keia lanakila ana, hoi aku la o Lonoikamakahiki a kapu heiau iho la ma Apuakehau, Kohala, aia malaila ka heiau i oleloia o Muleiula.

After this dedication he proceeded and held another ceremony at Puukohola. Having performed his duties at this place he went on, and at Kahaluu, in Kona, again held a dedication service at the temple of Makolea. On the way Kapulani, a rebel chief, was caught hiding in the valley by the victors. It had been previously reported that he was one of the chiefs who rebelled against Lonoikamakahiki, and because of that fact Kapulani was condemned to die. On the night that the council was held the intention was to place him on the altar the following morning, but during the night he was assisted to escape by Kalanioumi when he, Kapulani, made his way to Kau safe from the clutches of the victors."

A penei ka moolelo o Lonoikamakahiki ma ia holo ana:","Subsequent to the slaughter of the chiefs of Hawaii by Lonoikamakahiki he consulted his wife Kaikilani for the purpose of going to Maui on a visit to Kamalalawalu. They decided, and so did all the chiefs, to allow them to go, in consequence of some plans Lonoikamakahiki had in view. On the day he was prepared to sail to Maui he selected a sufficient number of men, including his strongest and best-known warriors. He also selected his younger brother Pupuakea, well known as the premier and general, to accompany the party. On this voyage of Lonoikamakahiki he did not forget Hauna in his capacity as priest and counselor. The following is the tradition of Lonoikamakahiki concerning this voyage:"
"Ia Lonoikamakahiki i hiki aku ai ma Maui, e noho ana o Kamalalawalu ma Hana, ma ke Ahupuaa i oleloia o Wananalua. Ia Lonoikamakahiki i pae aku ai ma ke awa pae waa i Punahoa, ike ia mai la o Lonoikamakahiki e Kamalalawalu, kiiia mai [ ] la ua o Lonoikamakahiki a me kona poe a pau, hoihoiia aku la ma ko Kamalalawalu hale alii. Ia manawa, akahi no oia a ike maka i ke alii o Hawaii, he lohe wale no kona. Ua oleloia he makuakane no o ua Kamalalawalu nei no Lonoikamakahiki.","On Lonoikamakahiki’s arrival at Maui, Kamalalawalu was residing at Hana on the ahupuaa called Wananalua. When Lonoikamakahiki went ashore at the canoe landing of Punahoa he was observed by Kamalalawalu, Lonoikamakahiki and his [ ] retinue being sent for and taken to Kamalalawalu’s royal residence, it being the first time he had cast eyes on the king of Hawaii, although he had previously heard of him. It was said that Kamalalawalu was an uncle of Lonoikamakahiki."
"He mau la paha mahope iho, he mea mau no hoi ma na hale alii o ia manawa, ka inu awa. A nolaila, makemake ae la o Kamalalawalu e inu awa pu me Lonoikamakahiki. Nolaila olelo aku o Kamalalawalu ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua makemake au e inu awa kaua.” A e like me ka makemake o ke alii o Maui, pela i ae aku ai ko Hawaii alii.","A few days thereafter, it being customary at the royal residences of those times to drink awa, it came to pass that Kamalalawalu wanted the pleasure of drinking awa with Lonoikamakahiki, so he said to Lonoikamakahiki: “It is my pleasure that we drink awa.” In compliance with the wish of the king of Maui the king of Hawaii in like manner gave his assent."
"I aku la o Kamalalawalu ia Lonoikamakahiki: “E hele kaua i ka heenalu a hoi mai ua wali ka awa.” A nolaila, hele aku la laua. Mamua nae o ko laua hele ana i ka auau, ua hooholo mua laua, he moa ka pupu o ko laua awa ke inu. Ia manawa nae ua kauoha ae la laua i ko laua mau kaikaina e hoomakaukau i ka awa a me ka pupu, mamua o ko laua hoi ana mai mai ka auau.","Kamalalawalu said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Let us go surf riding and by the time we return the awa will be ready.” They went. Before going, however, they decided that they would have a chicken as an accompanying dish to go with their awa, and gave directions to their younger brothers to prepare the awa and the extra dish before they returned from their surfing."
"O ka pupu a laua i manao ai no ka inu ana i ko laua awa, he moa. Mamua o ko Lonoikamakahiki hele ana i ka heenalu, kauoha iho la oia ia Pupuakea penei: “Ke hele nei au i ka heenalu me ke alii o Maui nei, puholo ae oe i ka moa i hoi mai maua mai ka auau mai, ua makaukau.” A pau ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo ana i kona kaikaina, hele aku la oia me Kamalalawalu i ka auau. A o Kamalalawalu hoi, ua kauoha ae la no hoi oia i kona kaikaina ia Makakuikalani, e like me ka Lonoikamakahiki kauoha ia Pupuakea. Ma keia mau olelo a na ’lii, aole ma kahi hookahi ka laua kamailio ana i na kaikaina o laua. Aka ma ke kaawale no laua i olelo ai, me ka lohe ole aku o kekahi i kekahi. A hala aku la na ’lii i ka heenalu, a o Makakuikalani hoi hana iho la oia i ka moa a Kamalalawalu, a me ka awa. A pau ka moa i ka puholo, a me ka awa i ka mama, alaila kali aku o ka hoi mai o ke alii.","The side dish they desired to have with the awa they were to drink was chicken. Before Lonoikamakahiki started to surf he spoke to Pupuakea thus: “I’m going in surfing now with the king of Maui. You cook the chicken in blood and let it be ready when we return from surfing.” After giving these directions to his younger brother, he proceeded with Kamalalawalu to surf. As for Kamalalawalu, he also had given his younger brother Makakuikalani the same instructions as Lonoikamakahiki gave to Pupuakea. These instructions of the kings were each given to their brothers separate, apart and distinct from each other and not in the hearing of each other. Their majesties then went surfing. Makakuikalani prepared the chicken and awa for Kamalalawalu. The chicken cooked in blood and the awa masticated he awaited the return of the king."
"Aka, o Pupuakea, aole oia i hana i na mea a kona kaikuaana i kauoha ai ia ia, no ka mea, aole oia i ike i ka hana ana o ka moa, a me ka mama ana o ka awa, no ka mea, aole i maa. Aka nae, he mea haohao no ia ia Pupuakea, keia kauoha ana a Lonoikamakahiki, me ka ike no o ke alii, aole i maa o Pupuakea i ka hana ana o ka moa.","As for Pupuakea, however, he made no preparations as he was directed to, for the reason he knew not how to prepare chicken nor how to properly chew the awa, being unaccustomed to such things. It was a surprise to Pupuakea himself that Lonoikamakahiki should have ordered him to do so, knowing full well that he (Pupuakea) was not accustomed to preparing chickens."
"A hoi mai la na ’lii mai ka auau mai, ua makaukau o Kamalalawalu no kana mea e ai ai; a ninau aku la o Kamalalawalu ia Makakuikalani i ka makaukau; a hai mai la o Makakuikalani: “Ua makaukau, ua moa ka moa ua wali ka awa.” I aku la o Kamalalawalu: “Hoomakaukauia mai ka ai.” Alaila, ia manawa, lawelawe ia ae la na mea ai o ka ahaaina. A ia wa no, hoka iho la ka awa. A o Lonoikamakahiki, i kona manawa i hoi mai ai mai ka auau mai, ninau aku la ia Pupuakea: “Ea! Ke makaukau mai la ka Kamalalawalu mau mea ai; auhea hoi ka awa a me kau moe? Ua hana iho nei oe?” E konane ana nae o Pupuakea ia manawa. A i ko Pupuakea lohe ana i keia mau ninau a Lonoikamakahiki, hoole aku la o Pupuakea, me ka i aku: “Eiae no ka moa, aole i pepehi ia, aole no i mama ia ka awa, no ka mea, ua ike no oe, aole au i ike i ka hana ana o keia mau mea au i kauoha iho ai.”","On the return of their majesties from surfing, Kamalalawalu was ready for his meal. He inquired of Makakuikalani if it was ready, and he answered: “It is; the chicken is cooked and the awa is masticated.” So Kamalalawalu commanded: “Have the food served.” Preparations for the meal were made, the awa being strained at the order given for preparation. Lonoikamakahiki after having returned from surfing said to Pupuakea: “Preparations are being made for Kamalalawalu’s food. Where is my awa and chicken? Have you prepared them?” When Pupuakea was spoken to he was engaged playing konane. Upon hearing these inquiries of Lonoikamakahiki, Pupuakea replied: “No,” and said furthermore: “The chicken is here somewhere, not killed, nor has the awa been chewed, because you well know I have no knowledge of how to prepare the things you directed me to do.” [ ]"
"Ia manawa, wela ka huhu o Lonoikamakahiki, lalau iho la i ka papa konane, a hauhau aku la i ka lae o Pupuakea, a pa aku la ma ka lae, puai ke koko. A no ia mea, komo aku la ka huhu i loko o Pupuakea.

Because of this, Pupuakea was angered. Instantly he reached for the charcoal and firewood, started the fire, caught the chicken and choked it and tore away one of its legs. After having it skinned he broiled it over a fire at the same time reaching for the awa root. While the chicken was being broiled the awa was being chewed; with three quids of the awa the legs of the chicken were cooked, the awa strained and the cooked chicken legs placed on a platter. The awa cup was placed in front of the king, and also all the other things according to the directions given to Pupuakea. He said to the king: “The chicken and the awa are ready; it only awaits you to eat and to drink of the same.” When Lonoikamakahiki saw that the instructions he gave previous to surfing had been carried out, he ate before Kamalalawalu drank his awa."
"I ka manawa a Pupuakea e hana ana i ka moa nana pono mai la o Kamalalawalu, i ke kupanaha o ka Pupuakea hana ana, a makemake mai la. A pau ka laua inu awa ana a me ka paina ana, konane iho la ua mau alii nei. A iloko o ko laua manawa konane, olelo aku la o Kamalalawalu ia Lonoikamakahiki: “E, makemake aku la ka hoi au i kau kauwa, a i hoi oe ea, noho iho kau kauwa me a’u.” I aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kamalalawalu: “Aole ia he kauwa na’u, o ko’u kaulana aina no ia, a o ko’u kaikaina ponoi no ia. Aole e loaa aku ia oe.” A lohe o Kamalalawalu i keia olelo a Lonoikamakahiki i ka i ana, o ko’u kaulana aina no ia, nolaila olelo aku o Kamalalawalu: “Ina o kau kaulana aina kela, a o kou pukaua hoi ia, alaila ke olelo aku nei au, haahaa, haka pau i ka iole.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “O ka iki ulu makua ia nana e kaa ke kahualoa e pau ai.” A pau hoi ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo ana, alaila olelo aku o Kamalalawalu, me ke kuhikuhi ae ia Makakuikalani: “Ei ae no hoi ko’u kaulana aina, o ka’u pukaua no hoi keia, o ko’u kaikaina no.” A no ka Kamalalawalu hoohenehene ana i ko Lonoikamakahiki pukaua ia Pupuakea, nolaila olelo aku ai o Lonoikamakahiki i ka Kamalalawalu olelo ana: “O ko’u kaulana aina no hoi keia.” A nolaila o Lonoikamakahiki i olelo aku ai: “E, hakahaka, i ke ehu no o ka laau palau, kulana, aiwa a papa laau aku, o ka make no ia.” A no ka olelo ana mai a Lonoikamakahiki pela, i aku o Kamalalawalu: “O ka lila maia ia o Kaea, aole e pala i ke anahulu.”","While Pupuakea was preparing the chicken, Kamalalawalu took particular notice of the peculiar manner in which Pupuakea was doing it and rather admired the manner in which it was being done. After partaking of the awa and finishing their meal, the kings played konane, and during the game Kamalalawalu said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Say, I rather like your servant. Should you go home, let your servant remain with me.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “He is not a servant of mine, he is my notable and younger brother. You can not have him.” Therefore Kamalalawalu said: “If he is your notable and your general also, then I say to you, it is a low shelf which the rats will get at.” Lonoikamakahiki retorted: “He is a small maika that can cover a long course.” After Lonoikamakahiki had finished talking, Kamalalawalu, pointing to Makakuikalani, said: “There is my notable, my general, and my younger brother also.” Because Kamalalawalu ridiculed Lonoikamakahiki’s general, Pupuakea, Lonoikamakahiki, referring to Kamalalawalu’s statement, “This my notable,” remarked: “He is hollow; the swirl of the war club would stagger him; a touch of the club would kill him.” In consequence of this remark of Lonoikamakahiki, Kamalalawalu replied: “He is the shrivelled banana of Kaea, which will not ripen in ten days.”"
"Iloko o keia mau olelo a Lonoikamakahiki me Kamalalawalu, waiho wale iloko o laua ia mea. A he mau manawa he nui mahope iho o keia mau hana a laua, i ka manawa i hoi aku ai o Lonoikamakahiki mai kana huakai kaapuni aku, manao ae la o Kamalalawalu e luku aku ma ke kaua i na ’lii o Hawaii, no ka mea, ua kui aku la ka lono o ko Lonoikamakahiki ikaika a me ka lanakila i ke kaua.","The passage of words between Lonoikamakahiki and Kamalalawalu were treasured and stored up within themselves. After a considerable time following the events narrated, and subsequent to the return of Lonoikamakahiki from his tour, Kamalalawalu entertained the idea to destroy by war the chiefs of Hawaii in consequence of reports having been brought of Lonoikamakahiki’s strength and his success in war."
"A o Kauhiokalani, ka Kamalalawalu keiki ponoi; o Kauhiakama hoi kekahi inoa ona. Hoouna aku la o Kamalalawalu i kana keiki e holo i Hawaii, me ka i aku: “E holo oe e nana i ka nui o na kanaka o Hawaii, hoi mai oe a hai mai ia’u.”","Kamalalawalu dispatched his own child Kauhiokalani, otherwise known as Kauhiakama, for Hawaii instructing him thus: “You go to learn the number of people there are on Hawaii, and on your return report to me.”"
"Nolaila, e like me ko Kamalalawalu makemake, holo aku la o Kauhiokalani ka mea i kapaia o Kauhiakama i Hawaii. Ia holo ana, pae mua aku la oia ma Kohala, ma ke awa pae waa i oleloia o Puakea. A hiki oia malaila kau na waa, hele aku la ma na kahakai o Kohala a hiki i Kawaihae; aka aole i loaa nui na kanaka ia ia ma ia hele ana aku, he kakaikahi loa. [ ]","In accordance with the wish of Kamalalawalu, Kauhiokalani, otherwise known as Kauhiakama, sailed for Hawaii. He arrived at Kohala at a landing place for canoes known as Puakea. Having arrived there, the canoes were put ashore and he began his itinerary along the coast of Kohala until he reached Kawaihae. On his journey he found very few people. [ ]"
"Hele aku la ua o Kauhiakama mai laila aku a hiki i Kona, i Kapalilua, ma ka palena o Kau a me Kona, aole no ia i halawai nui me na kanaka. Pela kana hele ana a puni o Hawaii, aole oia i ike i ka lehulehu o na kanaka i loaa ia ia.

No ka mea, he mea mau ma ia wahi, ka akoakoa mau i kela la keia la i ka mokomoko.","Kauhiakama thence travelled on from there to Kona Kapalilua, at the boundary of Kau and Kona, not meeting many people. He continued on until he made the circuit of Hawaii, without seeing a great many people. At Kapaau, Kohala, on his homeward journey, there was congregated a large concourse of people at the athletic grounds called Hinakahua, it being customary for the people to gather together at this place for athletic contests."
"I iho la o Kauhiakama: “Kai noa ua nui aku ko Hawaii nei mau kanaka, aole ka; he kaulana wale iho no ka he moku nui, a o ke kanaka, he uuku loa. Ina la hoi e like ka nui o na kanaka o kahi a’u i hele ae nei e makaikai e like me koonei mau wahi kanaka, ina la hoi e aho ia; aole, he ole loa no ka.”","Kauhiakama remarked: “I thought Hawaii had more people, but not so; it is only noted as being a large island, but as to the inhabitants there are very few. If the people on the route of my travel were only as numerically large as the people of this place, it would be something, but I find it is not so.”"
"A ike iho la o Kauhiakama i ka nui o na kanaka o Kohala ma ia kaapuni ana, alaila hoi aku la oia a hiki i Maui.

A oia ka mea i olelo ia e ka poe kahiko.","Kauhiakama, having observed the population of Kohala during this circuit, returned to Maui. Upon arrival there, Kamalalawalu asked him: “How is Hawaii?” Kauhiakama replied: “Kohala is depopulated; the people are only at the beach, because during my circuit of Hawaii I did not find a large number of them. I first arrived at Kohala, then traveled along its shore until Kawaihae was reached and did not meet a solitary man. At the place of my landing, however, I met a few, not exceeding forty, perhaps, and at Kawaihae there were some places with few men. I proceeded from Kawaihae through Kona to a part of Kau, all the way not meeting many people. That is the most desolate place, composed of nothing but clinkers. I continued my circuit from Kau to Puna, Hilo and Hamakua. I do not recollect coming in contact with three four hundred (1200) men. On my way to Kohala I found it to be the only locality which contained some people. Kohala is depopulated; the people are only at the beach.” Kamalalawalu having heard this report from his son Kauhiakama ordered Makakuikalani to make preparations for war. It has been mentioned in this narrative that two men came from Hawaii who urged Kamalalawalu to give battle to Hawaii, being Kauhipaewa and Kihapaewa, the sons of Kumaikeau and another. According to the old historians it was Lonoikamakahiki himself who sent these two men to urge Kamalalawalu to go to war with Hawaii. And this is the story told concerning the two men. Because of Lonoikamakahiki’s intense desire to wage battle with Kamalalawalu, the former sent Kauhipaewa and Kihapaewa to consult Kamalalawalu concerning it. These two men arrived before Kamalalawalu without the latter knowing that they were emissaries from Lonoikamakahiki. On the occasion of the two men meeting Kamalalawalu, they remarked: “Go and make war on Hawaii, as you can take it if you give battle, because Lonoikamakahiki has no power, nor has his general either.” Because of the remarks of these two men to Kamalalawalu, he harbored the idea of going to Hawaii to wage war."
"A penei hoi ka olelo a kekahi poe malama moolelo.

Ma keia ano wale no i lana nui ai o Kamalalawalu e hele e kaua ia Lonoikamakahiki.","The following is said by some of the ancient historians to be the correct narrative: Because of Lonoikamakahiki’s desire to test the strength of their two generals, putting into effect the compliments exchanged between them at the time of the awa drinking both Kihapea and Kauhipea said to Kamalalawalu: “If you should sail for Hawaii to give battle to Lonoikamakahiki, let us carry on the war from the top of Puuoaoaka and Hokuula. Let us occupy these places first; we will then possess the [ ] stones on the heights and compel Lonoikamakahiki to do his fighting from below; we, being above, would only have to roll the rocks and thus will the people of Hawaii be defeated by those of Maui.” So said these men to Kamalalawalu, which was nothing more nor less than deception, expressed so as to bring about Kamalalawalu’s destruction. It was only by such means that Kamalalawalu’s high ambitions were aroused to wage war against Lonoikamakahiki."
"Mahope iho o ka Kauhipaewa ma kamailio ana ia Kamalalawalu no ke kaua, alaila hoi aku la laua i Hawaii. A i ka hiki ana aku i Hawaii, e noho ana o Lonoikamakahiki i Puako ia manawa, e kali ana no ia Kauhipaewa ma i ka hoi aku.

A hala aku la o Kauhipaewa ma i Hawaii; alaila, hoomakaukau ae la o Kamalalawalu no ka holo i ke kaua i Hawaii.","After Kauhipaewa and his companion made their final statement to Kamalalawalu concerning war they immediately returned to Hawaii. Upon their arrival at Hawaii, Lonoikamakahiki was then residing at Puako, awaiting the return of Kauhipaewa and his companion. Upon their arrival the king inquired as to their mission. They made report as to conversations had with Kamalalawalu. Lonoikamakahiki then made preparations for war, so as to be ready when Kamalalawalu made his appearance. After Kauhipaewa and his companion had departed for Hawaii Kamalalawalu made preparations to sail thither for war."
"A ike ae la o Lanikaula, e hoomakaukau ana no ka holo i Hawaii i ke kaua me Lonoikamakahiki, i aku la o Lanikaula ia Kamalalawalu: “Auhea oe, e hoomakaukau ana keia mau waa ou a hele ihea?” I aku la o Kamalalawalu: “E holo ana e kaua me Lonoikamakahiki.” I aku o Lanikaula: “Aole e hee o Lonoikamakahiki ia oe, no ka mea, aole he ikaika nui e loaa ai o Lonoikamakahiki, no ka mea, he kanaka oe, a he akua kela.” I aku o Kamalalawalu: “Ka!

Preparing these canoes of yours to go where?” Kamalalawalu replied: “To sail to fight Lonoikamakahiki.” Lanikaula replied: “You will not defeat Lonoikamakahiki, because no amount of strength will ever overcome Lonoikamakahiki, for the reason that you are a human being and he a god.” Kamalalawalu made answer: “Kauhiakama says Kohala is depopulated; the people are only at the beach.” To this remark of Kamalalawalu, Lanikaula replied: “You sent your son Kauhiakama to investigate as to how many people there were on Hawaii. He returned and made his report to you that there were not many people there, but Kauhiakama did not see the number of people in Kohala because he traveled on the seashore, reaching Kona from Kawaihae and arrived on the heights of Huehue. He could not have seen the people of that locality because there were only clinkers there, having proceeded along by way of Kona until he arrived at Kau. If he had traveled along the Kona route in the early morning he could not have met people at that time because the inhabitants of that section had gone to the uplands and some had gone fishing; those remaining home were only the feeble and sick, therefore the people of Kona could not have been seen by Kauhiakama on his tour. Had he gone during the evening he would surely have seen the large population of Kona because it is the largest district of Hawaii.”"
"Ma keia olelo a Lanikaula, aole nae he hoomaopopo nui o Kamalalawalu ia olelo, aka hoomau no o Kamalalawalu i kona manao kaua.

He still inclined to the idea of war. Lanikaula observed that Kamalalawalu was bent on going to war. He therefore spoke to Kamalalawalu again: “If you [ ] intend to go to war with Lonoikamakahiki, then your grounds should be at Anaehoomalu; and should Lonoikamakahiki come to meet you, then let the battle be fought at Pohakuloa, it being a narrow place; then you will be victorious over Hawaii.” Kamalalawalu answered: “You do not know, because I was distinctly told by both Kauhipaewa and Kihapaewa that our battle field should be on Hokuula and Puuoaoaka, it being a place of eminence. ” Lanikaula again said: “You are being deceived by the sons of Kumaikeau and others; you have been led astray, therefore listen to me, for if you heed not my admonitions I do not think that you will ever come home to Maui nei again.”"

But Lanikaula, out of sympathy for the king, did not cease to again give him warning: “Kamalalawalu! You are very persistent to have war. This is what I have to say to you: Better hold temple services these few days before you proceed. Propitiate the gods first, then go.” But Kamalalawalu would not harken to the words of Lanikaula, therefore he ended his remarks. Makakuikalani made the preparations of the war canoes in accordance with the strict orders of Kamalalawalu. When the canoes and the several generals, together with all the men, including the war canoes of Kamalalawalu, were ready floating in the harbor of Hamoa, Lanikaula came forth and in the presence of King Kamalalawalu and his war canoes prophesied in chant his last words to Kamalalawalu:"
"Koae ula ke koae kea, Koae lele pauma ana; Kiekie iluna ka hoku, Haahaa i au ka malama.

It is mentioned in this tradition relative to the number of canoes of Kamalalawalu that the rear war canoes were at Hamoa, Hana, and the van at Puakea, Kohala; but at the time of this narrative the opinions of the ancients differed as to the accuracy of this. Some say that the number of canoes is greatly exaggerated."

At the first meeting that Kamalalawalu had with Kauhipaewa and others, Kumaikeau and others [ ] (who were men from the presence of Lonoikamakahiki) said to Kamalalawalu: “Carry the canoes inland; take the outriggers off so that should the Hawaii forces be defeated in battle they would not use the flotilla of Maui to escape. When they find that the outriggers have all been taken apart and the victors overtake them the slaughter will be yours.” Kamalalawalu did as he was told to do by the two old men."

Kamalalawalu learning that Kanaloakuaana was still living at Waimea he concluded that his first battle should be fought with Kanaloakuaana and at Kaunooa. Kanaloakuaana was completely routed and pursued by the soldiers of Kamalalawalu, and Kauhiakama, and Kanaloakuaana was captured at Puako. At this battle the eyes of Kanaloakuaana were gouged out by the Maui forces, the eye sockets pierced by darts, and he was then killed, the eyes of Kanaloakuaana being tatued."

Because of the perpetration of this dastardly act on Kanaloakuaana the following was composed by a writer of chants, being the middle portion of a chant called “Koauli”:"

The Maui forces followed and after locating at Hokuula awaited the [ ] coming fray. On the day Kamalalawalu and his men went up to Waimea to occupy Hokuula the two deceitful old men at the time were with Kamalalawalu. In the early morning when Kamalalawalu awoke from sleep he beheld the men from Kona and those of Kau, Puna, Hilo, Hamakua and Kohala had also been assembled."

Kamalalawalu was astonished, because the day before he observed that the lava was one mass of black, but this morning it was entirely red with people. Thereupon Kamalalawalu inquired of Kumaikeau and the others why the lava was a mass of red: “What does red portend? Does it mean war?” Kumaikeau and the others replied: “Do not think the red you see is some other red and not what you assume it to be. It is not war. That red yonder is the wind. The olauniu wind of Kalahuipuaa and Puako had been blowing in the early morning and when it is very light and gentle it hugs the lava close. This olauniu wind on the lava coming in contact with the wind from Wainaualii raises a cloud of dust covering and hiding the land in the manner you saw yesterday. ” While cogitating to himself, Kamalalawalu concluded to drop the matter on account of the deceit of the two old men and the loss of confidence in what Kumaikeau and the others had said, for the reason that the lava continued to be strewn with people even to the time of the setting sun. During that night and including the following morning the Kona men arrived and were assigned to occupy a position from Puupa to Haleapala. The Kau and Puna warriors were stationed from Holoholoku to Waikoloa. Those of Hilo and Hamakua were located from Mahiki to Puukanikanihia, while those of Kohala guarded from Momoualoa to Waihaka."
"Ia kakahiaka, nana aku la o Kamalalawalu, ua uhi paa puia mai olalo i na kanaka, aole o kana mai. Alaila, nana ae la o Kamalalawalu ia lakou ua uuku loa; alaila, olelo aku la o Kamalalawalu ia Kumaikeau ma: “Ea! E Kumaikeau ma, pehea keia? Heaha keia lehulehu olalo?”","That morning Kamalalawalu observed that the lowlands were literally covered with almost countless men. Kamalalawalu then took a survey of his own men and realized that his forces were inferior in numbers. He then spoke to Kumaikeau and the others: “Kumaikeau and the rest of you, how is this and what is that large concourse of people below?”"
"I aku o Kumaikeau ma: “Akahi no au a ike i ka nui o na kanaka o Hawaii nei. Mai manao nae oe ia nui, e pakele ana ia kakou. Aole e pakele, aia ka lakou kaua malalo, he nui lakou, o ko lakou kaa malalo, make no ia kakou.”","Kumaikeau and the others replied: “We have never seen so many people in Hawaii before. Do not think that because of their superior numbers they will escape us; they cannot, for the reason that their fighting will have to be from below. It is true they are more numerous, but being beneath we will defeat them.”"
"I kekahi la ae, hele aku la o Lonoikamakahiki e halawai me Kamalalawalu, e kuka no ke kaua. A i ko laua kamailio ana, olelo aku o Kamalalawalu ia Lonoikamakahiki, e hoopau wale ke kaua, no ka mea, ua hopo mai la o Kamalalawalu no ka nui loa o ka Lonoikamakahiki kaua. Aka, ma kela olelo kaua a Kamalalawalu e hoopau wale ke kaua, aohe manao o Lonoikamakahiki e hoopau, e like me ka Kamalalawalu olelo, no ka mea, ua wela ko Lonoikamakahiki huhu no Kamalalawalu, no ka pepehi hoomainoino ana ia Kanaloakuaana; oia hoi, ua poaloia na maka, a ua hoomainoino ia i ko Kanaloakuaana wa e ola okoa ana.","The following day, Lonoikamakahiki went over to meet Kamalalawalu to confer concerning the war. During their conference Kamalalawalu proposed to Lonoikamakahiki that war cease because he feared the greater forces of Lonoikamakahiki. But the proposal by Kamalalawalu for termination of the war did not meet Lonoikamakahiki’s approval. He had no intention of acquiescing, because he was greatly incensed at Kamalalawalu for the brutal manner in which he killed Kanaloakuaana by gouging out the eyes and other brutal acts carried into execution while the latter was still alive."
"Aka hoi, o Makakuikalani, i kona lohe ana ia Kamalalawalu ua olelo aku oia ia Lonoikamakahiki e hoopau i ke kaua, he mea makemake ole nae ia ia Makakuikalani. Oia hoi, ua olelo aku o ua Makakuikalani nei ia Kamalalawalu, aole e hoopau i ke kaua. “Ho aku imua a kau i ka nananuu; alaila ike ia na keiki makua o kakou.” A no ia manaopaa o Makakuikalani, hoike mau ae la oia imua o ko Hawaii kaua i kela la keia la pau na la ekolu.

Then will it be known which of us is a full grown child.” This determination on the part of Makakuikalani was manifested by his presence for three consecutive days before the forces of Hawaii. After the third day, the two combatting forces waged battle, Lonoikamakahiki gaining the victory over Kamalalawalu’s entire force on the same day the battle was fought, the Maui-ites being completely routed."
"A penei hoi ka moolelo oia hoouka kaua ana i oleloia e ka poe kahiko, ma ka lakou malama moolelo ana. Mamua o ka hoouka kaua ana, he mea mau i na elemakule ka paipai ana ia Kamalalawalu e kaua.

Before the battle commenced it was customary for the old men to encourage Kamalalawalu to do battle. Whenever the two old men heard what Kamalalawalu and the others had to say as to what they intended doing to Lonoikamakahiki in order to be victorious in battle, the old men would wend their way to make it known to Lonoikamakahiki and the others and this duty was generally carried out during some convenient time of night. The two old men always pointed out to Kamalalawalu and the others where the battle should be fought, and the suggestions of the old men were always received with the utmost confidence by him. Therefore Kumaikeau and the two deceitful old men would in turn inform Lonoikamakahiki. The two old men never suggested any place for battle which would result advantageously to Kamalalawalu and his forces; on the contrary, it was invariably such a locality where inevitable defeat would result."
"I ka la o ka hoouka kaua, ma ke kakahiaka nui, hele aku la o Makakuikalani mamua, a o kona poe kaua mahope ona, a ma Waikakanilua, malalo aku o Hokuula a me Puuoaoaka, ma ka hulei e nana iho ana ia Waikoloa.

Aka, ua makaukau no na aoao a elua no ke kaua.","In the early morning of the day of battle, Makakuikalani went to the front with his warriors following him and planted themselves at Waikakanilua below Hokuula and Puuoaoaka at a prominence looking towards Waikoloa. Pupuakea, on observing that Makakuikalani was placing his men and self in position, he and his warriors immediately came forward prepared to give battle. It was a case where both sides were equally prepared for the fray."
"He kanaka nui a loihi o Makakuikalani, ka pukaua ikaika kaulana o Maui, ko Kamalalawalu kaikaina. A o Pupuakea hoi, ko Hawaii pukaua ikaika kaulana, ko Lonoikamakahiki kaikaina, he wahi kanaka uuku no ia, a haahaa hoi.

As for Pupuakea, Hawaii’s celebrated and powerful general and who was Lonoikamakahiki’s younger brother, he was only a man of small stature. Both men had been taught the art of fighting with the wooden club and were experts in its use, but their schooling was under different masters and at different places."
"Aka, o Pupuakea, iloko o kona manawa i ike aku ai ia Makakuikalani, aole i komo mai iloko ona ka makau, aole no hoi oia i weliweli, aka, kupaa mau no oia e kaua aku ia Makakuikalani.","On the day of battle the sight of Makakuikalani put Lonoikamakahiki’s forces in dreadful fear. When Pupuakea saw Makakuikalani he had no fear of him, did not tremble but stood firm ready to give battle."
"Ia Makakuikalani a me Pupuakea e ku ana ma ke kahua kaua, ia manawa, lawe ae la o Makakuikalani i kana laau palau a kiekie, a hahau iho la maluna iho o Pupuakea, a no ka haahaa o Pupuakea, ua pa lihi aku la o Pupuakea, aka, haule aku la o Pupuakea ilalo i ka honua.

Being short in stature he was only slightly struck but fell to the ground, however. At the instant Makakuikalani’s war club struck Pupuakea the end of it was buried deep into the ground. At the moment Pupuakea was struck by the war club and fell Makakuikalani thought that he was killed, but the latter’s master saw that Pupuakea was not dead, so [ ] said to Makakuikalani: “Go back and slay him for your opponent is not dead. Your clubbing being from above only delivered a blow with the butt end.” Makakuikalani hearing the words of his teacher turned around and threw the butt end of his club, at the same time telling him to “Shut up! Instruction stops at home. He cannot escape, he must be dead because the club strikes true.” At the very instant that Makakuikalani faced around to talk with his teacher, he (the teacher) was dead."
"I ka manawa a Pupuakea e waiho ana i ka honua, ua maule aku la oia, a mahope loaa mai la ka mama iki ana ae, ia manawa, ala ae la o Pupuakea mai ka honua ae; ia manawa ike mai la o Makakuikalani ua ola hou o Pupuakea, alaila, holo hou mai la o Makakuikalani imua o Pupuakea, me ka manao e hoomake loa ia Pupuakea.","Pupuakea was lying on the ground, stunned, but somewhat recovered afterwards and raised himself up from the ground. When Makakuikalani saw that Pupuakea was still alive he rushed towards him bent on killing him."
"A ike aku la o Pupuakea ia Makakuikalani e hele mai ana e kue hou iaia, alaila hoomakaukau ae la oia e pepehi aku ia Makakuikalani.

Make aku la i ka laau a kaua i ka hualepo.”","Pupuakea observed Makakuikalani’s approach so prepared himself to slay him. When Makakuikalani drew near, Pupuakea raised his club and twirled it from his right. At that moment Makakuikalani attempted also to lay his club on Pupuakea, and when his club was twirled it skidded along the ground towards the feet of Makakuikalani and being parried by Makaku, fell to the ground. When Makakuikalani swung his club from the left side it struck the back of his own neck and he was instantly killed. Pupuakea immediately stepped backward and met his master who said to him: “Go back again and slay him so he be dead.” The words of his master aroused Pupuakea’s pride and he said to his teacher: “He cannot live, he is dead.” Then looking at the palm of his hand he again said to his master: “He cannot be alive because the birthmark of Pupuakea has impressed itself thereon. The flying club through dust has killed him.”"

A penei ka moolelo o kona pakele ana.",After the great and renowned general of Maui had fallen the Hawaii forces continued to slaughter Kamalalawalu and the others. Upon the death of Kamalalawalu the slaughter of the Maui-ites continued for three days thereafter and those defeated who ran towards their canoes found no arms and outriggers because they had been broken. The repulsed warriors ran to Puako and noticing the paimalau floating in the sea mistook them for canoes. They began to waver and were again overtaken by the victors. The destruction of the remaining invaders was then complete. Referring to Kauhiakama the son of Kamalalawalu he escaped to safety. The story of his escape running thus:
"I ka la o ka hee ana o ko Maui poe kaua, holo malu aku la oia a hiki i Kawaihae, a malaila mai e holo ana me ka manao e pee ma na ana, a hiki i ka wa e lanakila ai, alaila hoike ae.","On the day that the Maui forces were defeated Kauhiakama clandestinely escaped to Kawaihae and from there his intentions were to hie to the caves, there to remain until his side was victorious and then make his appearance."
"A o Hinau, kekahi o na pukaua o Lonoikamakahiki, he elele no na Lonoikamakahiki, aka, ua nui loa ke aloha o Hinau ia Kauhiakama. Nolaila, mamua o ko Hinau manao ana e hoomahuka ia Kauhiakama, pulehu ae la oia i mau kalo, a moa, a paa pu ae la me na oopu maloo i pulehuia, a imi aku la ia Kauhiakama; ma Kawaihaeo ko Hinau hiki mua ana, a malaila aku a hiki i Kaiopae, ike mua aku la o Hinau ia Kauhiakama, alaila, kahea aku la: “E Kauhiakama e!

A pau ia, hoomahuka aku la o Hinau ia Kauhiakama, a hala aku la i Maui, a pela i pakele ai o Kauhiakama i na lima o kona poe enemi.","Hinau, one of the generals of Lonoikamakahiki and a messenger also, had great affection for Kauhiakama, but it was previous to the time of Hinau’s assisting in the escape of Kauhiakama that he roasted some taro and, together with some dried mudfish, already roasted, proceeded to search for Kauhiakama. Hinau came to Kawaihae first and from there went to Kaiopae where for the first time he saw Kauhiakama, so Hinau hailed him and said: “Say, Kauhiakama, remain there until I reach you!” Kauhiakama looking round saw Hinau approaching, the thought of death at the hands of the victorious crossed his mind, so covering his face with his hands he wept, for he [ ] was greatly depressed in spirits. Hinau came forward, however, and greeted him with a kiss on the nose, remarking: “I remained behind and roasted some taro and dried mudfish for the love of you and came to search for you.” These words of Hinau gave Kauhiakama great relief and hopes for life. Kauhiakama then ate of the taro prepared by Hinau and when he had finished Hinau assisted Kauhiakama to escape to Maui. Thus was Kauhiakama saved from falling into the hands of his enemies."
"Ia Kauhiakama i hoi ai a Maui, hapai nui ae la oia ia Hinau, a kapa ae la i ka inoa o ka hale o Hinau, na umeke a me na ipukai, o Hinau; a kapa aku la i ka inoa o na mahinaai koele o Hinau. Ua kapaia na mea a pau a Kauhiakama o Hinau; he mau mea e hoomanao ana i na mea a pau a Hinau i hana maikai aku ai ia ia (Kauhiakama).",Upon Kauhiakama’s return to Maui he sang the praises of Hinau; named his house after him and also the calabashes and fish-bowls. The cultivated fields were also named after him. Everything he possessed was named after Hinau in memory of the many tokens of friendship and kindness shown to him.
"A he mau makahiki he nui ma ia hope mai, kui aku la ka lono ia Lonoikamakahiki, a lohe oia i keia mau hana a Kauhiakama, ma ke kapa ana i na mea a pau ana, mamuli o ka inoa Hinau.

In consequence of this certain messengers were dispatched to Maui by Lonoikamakahiki to get Hinau. Before the departure of the emissaries to get Hinau he instructed them thus: “You go and bring Hinau by my command, and should you meet him, say to him to return to Hawaii and govern the country because I am going to Kauai, to view the trunkless koa tree of Kahihikolo. He is to be in my stead and inform him so. Should he board your canoes, take him to Alenuihaha channel, tear him alive in the sea, because he has done wrong by assisting Kauhiakama to escape, thus violating my very commands, to allow no one of Maui with royal blood to live.” After he had given these instructions to his emissaries they set sail for Maui."
"A i ka halawai ana o ua mau luna nei me Hinau, ike aku la nae ua mau luna nei, o Hinau ke kanaka koikoi o Maui imua o Kauhiakama, a oia hookahi no ka punahele oi imua o ko Kauhiakama alo. Aka, ma na mea i kauohaia ia lakou na luna e hana aku, alaila hana aku la no lakou e like me ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo.","When the emissaries met Hinau they learned that he was the greatest man in Maui in the retinue of Kauhiakama and was the latter’s cherished favorite. However, the instructions had to be carried out and the same were discharged in a manner that was entirely pleasing to Lonoikamakahiki."
"A i ka lohe ana o Hinau i keia mau olelo a Lonoikamakahiki ma ka waha aku o ua mau luna nei, a ike mai la o Hinau ua ano oiaio na olelo a pau i haiia aku iaia, alaila, hooholo ae la oia i kona manao ae no na mea i hai ia aku ai.

A make aku la o Hinau, hoi aku la na luna a hai aku la i ka make ana o Hinau. Alaila, ua loaa ka oluolu ia Lonoikamakahiki.","Hinau heard the wishes of Lonoikamakahiki from the lips of the emissaries, and believing the truth of the message decided to obey the same. Kauhiakama had no intention of allowing Hinau to sail to Hawaii for he was worried lest he return not again to Maui. Hinau, however, was under the belief that he was to rule only during the time of Lonoikamakahiki’s absence on Kauai, and when he returned, he (Hinau) would again return to Maui. Upon Hinau’s boarding the canoes and sailing for Hawaii while yet breathing with life he was cut in two whilst in the open sea by the emissaries in compliance with the instructions of Lonoikamakahiki. So died Hinau. On the return of the men they reported having put Hinau to death in the manner desired, thus gratifying the wishes of Lonoikamakahiki."
"A pau ke kaua ana me Kamalalawalu ma Waimea, a mahope iho o ka make ana o Hinau, ia manawa hoomaopopo hou ae la o Lonoikamakahiki e holo i Kauai; oia hoi i ike aku ai oia ia Kahihikolo, i kahi o ke koa kumu ole.

For that voyage Lonoikamakahiki made preparations [ ] to take along with him his favorites, his warriors as companions and also his servants."
"Aka o Kaikilani, hoonohoia iho la oia ma ke ano hooponopono aina, a e malama hoi i na makaainana. A makaukau ko ke alii holo i Kauai, alaila holo aku la.

All preparations having been made the king sailed for Kauai arriving there with his entire retinue. Lonoikamakahiki went alone to view the trunkless tree of Kahihikolo his entire retinue having deserted him. There was a native, however, of the place by the name of Kapaihiahilina who joined the king on his tour. The king while thus journeying happened to look back to see where the rest of his people were and saw only a solitary man following him in the rear. He was a stranger with whom he had no acquaintance. Of the large retinue which accompanied him from Hawaii not one was there, every man had deserted."
"I ka manawa o ke alii i ike mai ai ia Kapaihiahilina e ukali ana, aole oia i ekemu mai, aka, hoomau aku la no o Lonoikamakahiki i ka hele imua, me ka mea ole nana e kuhikuhi i kahi ana i hilinai nui ai e ike.

Ia manawa, akahi no a kamailio aku o Lonoikamakahiki iaia, me ka ninau aku: “E hele ana oe ihea?” I aku la o Kapaihiahilina: “I ukali wale mai nei no wau ia oe, no ka mea, lohe ae nei wau i ou kanaka i hoi ae nei, ua pau i ka haalele ia oe, nolaila, aloha ia oe, ukali mai nei.”","When the king observed Kapaihiahilina following him, he said not a word to him but continued on with his journey without even a guide to indicate the place he so much desired to see. When Lonoikamakahiki again turned back Kapaihiahilina was still following him. At this stage Lonoikamakahiki asked the man: “Where are you going?” Kapaihiahilina replied: “I merely followed you, because I heard from your people who were on their way back, that they had deserted you, and having sympathy for you, I followed.”"
"A o ua o Kapaihiahilina, iloko o kona manawa i lohe ai ua haaleleia, nolaila, lawe ae la oia i umeke poi, me na kauna oopu, a imi aku la i ke alii. He mea mau hoi ia Kapaihiahilina i na la a pau o kana ukali ana ia Lonoikamakahiki, ka malama ana i na kanawai o ke kapu alii. Oia hoi, i ka manawa kakahiaka nui, ka manawa e loihi ana ke aka o ke alii, aole o Kapaihiahilina i ike i ko laua kokoolua o laua wale, a’e aku i ke aka, aka, malama mau no oia i ke kapu alii.","Kapaihiahilina, upon being told that the king had been deserted, took a calabash of poi and some fours of mud-fish, and went in search of the king. It was Kapaihiahilina’s habit during the days he followed the king to observe the etiquette due to royalty, that is to say, during the early morning when the royal shadow was the longest, Kapaihiahilina, aware there were only the two of them, did not cross his shadow but always respected his royal dignity and position."
"A he mea mau hoi ia Lonoikamakahiki ka nana mau ana ia Kapaihiahilina ma kona ano menemene alii. A iloko o kekahi la o ka laua hele ana, i ka manawa e hookaawale ana o Kapaihiahilina iaia iho, ma ka hele ana, ma ka noho ana a me ka moe ana, i aku la o Lonoikamakahiki iaia: “Mai hookapukapu mai oe ia’u, no ka mea, o oe no ko’u hoahanau ponoi, aole a’u mea nui e ae, o oe hookahi wale no; nolaila, ma ko’u wahi moe, malaila mai oe, mai hookaawale oe ia’u, no ka mea ua pale ka pono eia kaua i ke au akua kahi i hele ai.” A nolaila, ua hookoia ka ke alii olelo, a noho pu iho la laua.","Lonoikamakahiki constantly observed Kapaihiahilina’s conduct as being most respectful of royalty. One day in the course of their journey, Kapaihiahilina, always to the rear of him at a respectable distance both when walking and when at sleep, Lonoikamakahiki said to him: “Do not hold me in sacredness because you are my own brother. I have nothing dearer than yourself, therefore, where I sleep, there will you sleep also. Do not hold me aloof, because all that is good has passed and we are now traveling in the region of the gods.” In consequence of this, the king’s wishes were observed, and they sat down together."

They were in great need of clothing and destitute of malo and had to use braided ferns in substitution thereof. They wandered on in this manner until they arrived at the place which Lonoikamakahiki was so desirous of seeing, which place was called Kahihikolo, but still continued on until they reached the shore. During these travels they were in the greatest distress from lack of food, lack of clothing, lack of malo and also distress from the rains. There was locked in the bosom of Lonoikamakahiki the thought always of how he should some day reward Kapaihiahilina. On their return from their mountain wanderings, Kapaihiahilina became a premier and a [ ] great favorite. Whatever belonged to Lonoikamakahiki in large as well as small things which had been left in charge of the men and the petty chiefs, including also the lands, all were under the administration of Kapaihiahilina. Before the eyes of Lonoikamakahiki no one else was superior to Kapaihiahilina and he was supreme over the island of Hawaii. Upon Lonoikamakahiki’s return to Hawaii after his sojourn in the mountains, he took Kapaihiahilina with him to Hawaii and appointed him his premier and held him as an esteemed favorite."
"Ma ko Lonoikamakahiki wahi moe, malaila o Kapaihiahilina e moe ai, ma kona wahi e noho ai, malaila pu no me Kapaihiahilina. O ka puloulou kapu alii, hiki ole i na punahele mua ana ke komo aku, malaila o Kapaihiahilina e noho ai. Aka, i ka hiki ana o Lonoikamakahiki i Hawaii me Kapaihiahilina, ike mai la na ilamuku a me na kakaolelo a Lonoikamakahiki, ua kela aku ka punahele o Kapaihiahilina mamua o na punahele mua, alaila, inoino ae la ko lakou manao no Kapaihiahilina, no ka mea, aole i hanaia kekahi mau punahele mamua e like me keia.","Wherever Lonoikamakahiki slept, there Kapaihiahilina slept also; wherever he lived, there also would Kapaihiahilina reside. The emblem of royal sacredness (puloulou) where his former favorites were not permitted to tread, there would Kapaihiahilina be found. When Lonoikamakahiki arrived on Hawaii with his companion the marshals and the statesmen of Lonoikamakahiki observed that Kapaihiahilina’s favoritism exceeded that of the king’s former favorites, and they became embittered at the idea and were envious of him for the reason that his former favorites never received such consideration."
"I kekahi la, hoakoakoa ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i kona mau kaukau alii a pau, a me kona mau kakaolelo, a hoike aku la i ko Kapaihiahilina lilo ana i poo kiekie ma ka aina a puni o Hawaii. Aka, he mea oluolu ole nae ia i ko na ’lii manao, a me ko Lonoikamakahiki alo alii a pau.","On a certain day, Lonoikamakahiki assembled all of his nobility and statesmen and declared that Kapaihiahilina was denominated the chief personage of all Hawaii. But this was not agreeable to the chiefs’ views and the court of Lonoikamakahiki."
"Mahope iho o ko Kapaihiahilina lilo ana i kuhina nui no Lonoikamakahiki, haawi ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i hookahi ahupuaa, o Hihiu nui, he wahi ahupuaa no ia e waiho ana ma Kohala. A noho ae la o Kapaihiahilina ma ka noho kuhina nui, imi ae la na luna malalo ona i hewa no Kapaihiahilina. Ua loaa no ka hewa, he hewa nui no, aka, no ka punahele nui launa ole no, nolaila, aole e manao ana o Lonoikamakahiki he hewa ia no Kapaihiahilina.","After the installation of Kapaihiahilina as premier for Lonoikamakahiki, he was awarded the ahupuaa called Hihiu nui, the same being located at Kohala. Kapaihiahilina having been inducted into the office of premier, his subordinate officers began to immediately entrap him into some offense. One was found, and a most serious one, but being a very great favorite of Lonoikamakahiki’s the king was loath to entertain any wrong in Kapaihiahilina."
"A no ka hewa ole o Kapaihiahilina ma na mea o ke alii, imi hou ae la na luna malalo ona i mea e hewa ai. Nolaila, loaa ae la ka hewa o Kapaihiahilina ma ka moekolohe ana me Kaikilani ka Lonoikamakahiki wahine ponoi, mamuli o ka hooweawea ia e na luna nana e imihala nei.

A nolaila, hai ia aku la ia Lonoikamakahiki keia hewa ana o Kapaihiahilina me Kaikilani. Aka i ko Lonoikamakahiki lohe ana i keia mea, aole ia he hewa i ko ke alii manao.","As no incriminating charges could be brought against Kapaihiahilina that would be entertained by the king, the inferior officers made greater efforts to convict him. They finally brought the charge against him of having had illicit intercourse with Kaikilani, the wife of Lonoikamakahiki, brought about principally by the acts of the subordinate officers themselves who studiously prepared the conspiracy. The inferior officers being aware of the illicit relations between Kapaihiahilina and Kaikilani and knowing that it was such an offense from which he could not escape, the conspirators placed the information before Lonoikamakahiki, who upon hearing of it set it aside as being unworthy of his royal attention."
"A no ka loaa ole o ko Kapaihiahilina hewa, ma keia mau mea, imua o ke alii, alaila, ua maopopo i ua mau luna nei, ua pakela loa ka punahele o Kapaihiahilina, nolaila hoopau ae la ua mau luna nei i ko lakou manao imihala. [ ]","Being unable to implicate Kapaihiahilina in these matters it dawned upon the conspiring officers that Kapaihiahilina was indeed a highly honored favorite of the king, so they gave up conspiring. [ ]"
"Hookahi paha makahiki o Kapaihiahilina ma ka noho kuhina nui, alaila holo aku la oia i Kauai, me ka manao no e hoi hou mai ma kona noho kuhina nui. I kela manawa o Kapaihiahilina i Kauai, manao ae la ke alo alii e imihala hou i mea e hewa ai o Kapaihiahilina ma kona noho kuhina nui, mai ka punahele ae a Lonoikamakahiki.

Whilst he was absent on Kauai the king’s suite renewed their conspiracy to implicate him in some trouble in his capacity as prime minister and as a favorite of Lonoikamakahiki. The chiefs immediately around the sovereign brought all manner of accusations of the most contemptuous description against Kapaihiahilina and the idea entered the king’s mind that he should be dismissed from his ministerial position as well as losing his place as a favorite."
"A hoohiki iho la o Lonoikamakahiki i olelo paa aole e ike hou i na maka o Kapaihiahilina. Mamuli o na olelo akiaki a ke alo alii, pau ae la ka punahele nui o Kapaihiahilina ia Lonoikamakahiki.",Lonoikamakahiki then made a solemn pledge that he would not again see the face of Kapaihiahilina. Through the subtle machinations of the royal suite the high esteem of Lonoikamakahiki for Kapaihiahilina ceased.
"Ma ia noho ana o Kapaihiahilina i Kauai, aole i liuliu, hiki aku ka lohe ia Kapaihiahilina, ua pau kona punahele, a me kona noho kuhina nui ana. Nolaila, holo mai la o Kapaihiahilina i Hawaii, i ike aku ai oia i ka pau io ana o kona punahele.

To verify what he had heard relative to his dismissal he sailed for Hawaii. Whilst on the voyage to Hawaii on his canoes he commenced the composition of a song wherein was recited his travels with Lonoikamakahiki in the mountain glens, their escapes from dangers of many descriptions. On the way, he first landed at Kohala, as he desired to see the land which had been given him. Upon arriving there he found that a new konohiki had been installed on the land and the one placed there by him had been dismissed. It was then that he realized his downfall. He set sail for Kona to fully acquaint himself with the commands of the king."
"Ia manawa, e noho ana o Lonoikamakahiki ma Kahaluu, no ka mea, he kapu heiau kana ia wa. A i ka hiki ana aku o Kapaihiahilina mawaho o Kahaluu, ike muaia mai la o Kapaihiahilina ma na waa.

When he came in sight immediately outside of Kahaluu, he was recognized at once by his canoes. In consequence thereof, Lonoikamakahiki immediately gave orders that the doors of the house be closed. The doors were not, however, closed at once. At the time the canoes reached the shore and Kapaihiahilina commenced wending his way to the king, when nearing the fencing of the house the doors shut. Kapaihiahilina observing the door closing on him stood outside the fence where the sentinels stood. Raising his voice on high he described in chant their wanderings:"
"A pau ka Kapaihiahilina kahea ana ia Lonoikamakahiki ma ke mele, alaila huli hoi aku la oia, me ka uwe pu i ke aloha i ke alii, a kau iluna o na waa, a holo aku la. I ka manawa i pau ae ai ka Kapaihiahilina kahea ana i ka inoa o Lonoikamakahiki, a mahope iho, kupu mai la ko Lonoikamakahiki aloha no Kapaihiahilina, no kona hoalohaloha ana mai, ma ke ano o ka laua pili ana, a me ko laua hele ana.

Aka, i ka wehe ana ae o ke pani o ka hale alii, aia o Kapaihiahilina e holo ana mawaho o Laaloa.","At the end of Kapaihiahilina’s greetings to Lonoikamakahiki in the chant he retraced his footsteps whence he had come, weeping with affection for the king. Boarding his canoes he sailed away. After Kapaihiahilina had ceased his dedicated chant of Lonoikamakahiki’s name the ancient love surged within his bosom for the loving tribute, the story of their companionship and their wanderings. It was very evident [ ] that Kapaihiahilina’s composition was founded on facts. Lonoikamakahiki then ordered the doors of his royal abode to be opened to allow Kapaihiahilina to enter the house. On opening the door of the royal mansion, however, Kapaihiahilina was then outside of Laaloa sailing away."
"A i ka ike ana o Lonoikamakahiki, e holo ana o Kapaihiahilina, alaila hoouna aku la oia i na elele, e kii aku ia Kapaihiahilina. A i ke kii ana o na elele mamuli o ka olelo a ke alii, a halawai aku la me Kapaihiahilina, me ka olelo aku: “I kii mai nei makou ia oe e hoi; ua hoouna mai nei ia makou e olelo aku ia oe e hoi, no ka mea, ua nui loa ke aloha o ke alii ia oe i ko kaukau ana ae ma ke mele, e like me ka olua hele ana; haalele aku la makou, aia no ke alii (Lonoikamakahiki) ke uwe la.”","Lonoikamakahiki observing that Kapaihiahilina had sailed away, sent messengers to get him to return. The messengers, in conformity with the king’s desire, set forth and upon reaching Kapaihiahilina said to him: “We come for you to return; we were sent to beseech you to come back; the king is overwhelmed with love for you and your appeal for compassion by the chant describing your wanderings; when we left the king was still weeping.”"
"A lohe o Kapaihiahilina i keia leo, alaila olelo aku la oia i na elele, me ka i aku: “E hoi olua a i ke alii, e hai aku i kuu aloha iaia, aole au e hoi aku; no ka mea, ua hoolohe aku ia i na olelo a ka poe akiaki o kona alo, malia paha o ua poe la no kekahi i hele pu me ia, a ai i ka pua pala o ka hala o Pooku, a hume pu i ka malo laki, a me ka palai.

O u hoi olua.” A pau ka Kapaihiahilina olelo ana i ua mau luna nei, alaila, hoi aku la laua, a halawai me ke alii (Lonoikamakahiki), a hai aku la i na mea a pau a Kapaihiahilina i olelo mai ai.","Kapaihiahilina hearing what was said, replied to the messengers: “You both return to the king. Give him my love and say, I cannot go back, because he has harkened to the slanderers who surround him. They may be the ones who accompanied him and ate the ripe flowers of the pandanus of Pooku and girded together the ti leaves as well as the ferns. Therefore I am now homeward bound to bury my bones on Kauai’s shore. If I should die it would be of no moment to him, but should it be he who shall pass away, my companion of many perils, I will weep for him alone at Kauai. Both of you go back.” When Kapaihiahilina finished what he had to say to the messengers, they went back, met the king and reported all that Kapaihiahilina had said."
"A ma keia mea a ua mau elele nei i olelo mai ai, he mea pono ole loa ia ia Lonoikamakahiki. A nolaila, hoolale ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i kana mau hoewaa elua, ia Kapahi a me Moanaikaiaiwa, o Kipunuiaiakamau ma, o ke keiki hookama o Kamahualele. A mamua o kona (Lonoikamakahiki) holo ana, kauoha ae la oia ia Kaikilani, Kealiiakalani, Kalanioumi, a me Keakealani: “Eia wau ke hele nei, e noho oukou i ka aina, e nana kekahi o oukou i kekahi, mai kekeue oukou. Ina hoi i hele au a i maliu mai kuu hoa hele ia’u, alaila, hoi mai maua, aka hoi i maliu ole mai kela, alaila, ukali aku no au mamuli ona (Kapaihiahilina), a malia paha o maliu mai i ka ukali loihi ia aku. Oi-e, he makole ka huhu, o hele a ka lihi pepeiao.”","In consequence of the statements made by the messengers Lonoikamakahiki became very much aggrieved. He immediately ordered his two canoe paddlers, Kapahi and Moanaikaiaiwa, also Kipunuiaiakamau and the adopted child of Kamahualele to prepare themselves for the voyage. Prior to Lonoikamakahiki’s sailing he commanded Kaikilani, Kealiiokalani, Kalanioumi and Keakealani thus: “I am about to go; stay on the land; let each of you care for each other and be not envious of one another. If I go and my companion harkens to me, then we will return; but should he listen not, then I will follow him, and by being persistent in my search he may relent, for anger only inflames and reaches the tips of the ears.”"
"A pau ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo ana i keia mau olelo, kau aku la oia iluna o na waa a holo aku la. Ia imi ana a Lonoikamakahiki, halawai aku la oia me Kapaihiahilina ma Anaehoomalu, ma ke kaha, ma ka palena o Kona a me Kohala. A penei no ka moolelo oia imi ana a Lonoikamakahiki.",Lonoikamakahiki having ceased his admonitions went aboard the canoes which awaited him and sailed away. In his search he met Kapaihiahilina at Anaehoomalu at the seashore at the dividing line of Kona and Kohala. Thus runs the tradition concerning Lonoikamakahiki’s search for his companion Kapaihiahilina:
"I ka manawa i imi aku ai o ua o Lonoikamakahiki, ua pae mua aku o Kapaihiahilina i Anaehoomalu a mahope aku lakou nei (Lonoikamakahiki ma). A i ka manawa i ike aku ai o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kapaihiahilina e noho mai ana i kaha one, ma kahi e kau ana na waa o lakou (o Kapaihiahilina ma), alaila, uwe aku la o Lonoikamakahiki, ma ka uwe helu ana, e like me ka laua hele ana. A ike mai la no hoi o Kapaihiahilina i ka uwe helu aku a ke alii, alaila uwe helu mai la no hoi oia. A ia laua i halawai ai, a pau ka laua uwe ana a me ka laua kamailio ana, alaila kau iho la o Lonoikamakahiki i olelo hoohiki mawaena o laua, aole e loaa hou kekahi [ ] kue, aole hoi e hoolohe i na olelo akiaki a kona mau aialo. Aka, i mea e paa io ai ka laua hoohiki, nolaila, kukulu iho la o Lonoikamakahiki i wahi ahu pohaku (heiau), i wahi no laua e pule ai me ka hoohiki imua o ke akua o Lonoikamakahiki, no ka hoopaa ana i ko laua hoohiki ana.","When Lonoikamakahiki set sail on his search for his friend, Kapaihiahilina had already arrived at Anaehoomalu and soon afterwards was followed by Lonoikamakahiki and others. Lonoikamakahiki saw Kapaihiahilina sitting on the sand beach when the canoes were being hauled ashore. Lonoikamakahiki immediately began to wail and also described their previous wanderings together. Kapaihiahilina recognizing the king also commenced wailing. When they came together and had ceased weeping and conversing, then Lonoikamakahiki made a covenant between them, that there would be no more strife, nor would he harken to the voice of slander which surrounds him, and in order that the understanding between them should be made binding, Lonoikamakahiki [ ] built a temple of rocks as a place for the offering of their prayers and the making of oaths to Lonoikamakahiki’s god to fully seal the covenant."
"A ike aku la o Kapaihiahilina ua hooiaio mai o Lonoikamakahiki i kana hoohiki ana, ia manawa ko Kapaihiahilina ae ana aku e hoi me Lonoikamakahiki. A pau ka laua kapu heiau ana malaila, hoi aku laua i Kona, a noho iho la ma Kaawaloa, ma Kona Hema.","Kapaihiahilina observed that Lonoikamakahiki was sincere in his desires and at that moment gave his consent to return with Lonoikamakahiki. After their religious observance at this place they returned to Kona and resided at Kaawaloa, in South Kona."
"(Ua oleloia ma ka moolelo o ko laua hana ana i olelo hoohiki no ke kukulu ana i ke ahu pohaku ma Anaehoomalu, ua kapaia ka inoa o ia palena mawaena o Kohala a me Kona “O Keahualono”; o ka inoa mau ia oia wahi a hiki mai i keia manawa; oia hoi ke kukulu ana o Lonoikamakahiki i ahu pohaku).","(Tradition says because of the covenant entered into for the erection of the mound of rocks at Anaehoomalu, the boundary between Kohala and Kona was named Keahualono, and that place has been known ever since by that name signifying the erection of a mound of rocks by Lonoikamakahiki.)"
"A i ka hoi ana o Lonoikamakahiki me Kapaihiahilina, noho hou iho la o Kapaihiahilina ma kona noho kuhina nui e like me ka noho mua ana. A mahope mai o ko Kapaihiahilina noho kuhina hou ana, alaila, kukakuka ae la o Kapaihiahilina me Lonoikamakahiki, i mea e kaawale aku ai ka poe nana i niania wale ia Kapaihiahilina mai ke alo alii aku.

Aka, ua ninau aku o Lonoikamakahiki i ko Kapaihiahilina manao no ka poe nana i niania wale oia, ina paha o ka make ko Kapaihiahilina makemake, oia no; alaila, o ko Lonoikamakahiki makemake no ia. A ina o ke kipaku ko Kapaihiahilina makemake, alaila pela no, o ko Lonoikamakahiki manao no ia. E like me ka Kapaihiahilina mea e koi ai, malaila aku no o Lonoikamakahiki.","After Lonoikamakahiki and Kapaihiahilina had returned home he resumed the office of premier as formerly. After his reinstatement to his former position a conference was held between him and the king as to how to get rid of the slanderers of Kapaihiahilina from the royal presence. It is stated that Kapaihiahilina had refused to return to Kona with Lonoikamakahiki at the time they met at Anaehoomalu, the exact conversation running as follows: “I will not return with you again until those who slandered me be got rid of from your presence; then only will I return with you.” By reason of this the conference was held. Lonoikamakahiki sought the wishes of Kapaihiahilina as to what disposition should be made of his slanderers, whether they should be slain, and if that, it was agreeable to him also. Should Kapaihiahilina express the desire to banish them, Lonoikamakahiki would acquiesce to that also. Lonoikamakahiki was bent on satisfying Kapaihiahilina’s every wish."
"A nolaila, ma kela kuka ana a laua ma keia mau mea, ua hooholo ko Kapaihiahilina manao, e pau i ka make ka poe nana i niania aku. Aka hoi, i mea e pau ai ko lakou make mainoino ana ma ka pepehi maoli aku, nolaila, ua waihoia ko lakou make maloko o ke kaua ana. A pau iho la ka poe nana i niania wale ia Kapaihiahilina i ka make. A mahope iho o ia manawa, kau pono iho la o Kapaihiahilina ma kona noho punahele ana, ma ka aoao kuhina nui a hiki i kona make ana.","At the conference stated for the consideration of this matter Kapaihiahilina decided to put to death those who had slandered him. In order to mitigate the horrible death which the slanderers would meet, by actual killing, it was decided that they should die in war. In this manner were the slanderers put out of existence. Kapaihiahilina ever after became firmly entrenched as a favorite, and he acted as premier even up to the time of his death."
"Ma ia hope mai a hiki i ko Lonoikamakahiki make ana, aole he mau kaua ana, aole no hoi he kipi, he maikai wale no. A hala o Lonoikamakahiki i ka make, ua oleloia, ua lilo ke Aupuni o Hawaii ia Keakealani.

After Lonoikamakahiki’s death it is said that the kingdom of Hawaii became the patrimony of Keakealani, and from his reign on to that of the successive kings until the time of Kamehameha, we are told by tradition that no great wars ever again took place. During the reign of Keoua, however, the several district chiefs rebelled. [ ]"

The name of Kualii is omitted in the genealogical records of the chiefs, but his history and doings have often been spoken of. It is told that Kualii was once king of these islands, and in one of his characters he was known to have possessed certain knowledge from a god, and at times even assumed the real attributes of a supernatural being."
"He alii kaulana o Kualii, no ka ikaika a me ke koa; ua lanakila mau oia iloko o na hoouka kaua maluna o kona poe enemi; a ua kaulana oia no kona puni kaua. Ua oleloia o Kualii, ua hoomaka kona kaua mai ka manawa kamalii mai a hiki i kona hoomakua ana.

A e like me ka makemake o Kualii, a pela i hana aku ai kona mau kanaka.","Kualii was a celebrated chief and noted for his strength and bravery; he was known to have won all the battles fought by him, defeating his enemies every time. He was also known for his great desire for war. It is said of Kualii that he began fighting battles in his childhood and so continued until he reached manhood. The following story exhibits some of the extraordinary traits in the character of this man."
"A i ka hoouka kaua ana o Kualii ia Oahu nei me na ’lii o Koolauloa mai, i ka manawa mahope mai o ko Kakuhihewa noho alii ana no Oahu nei, a i ole ia, i ka manawa paha mamua aku o ko Kakuhihewa noho alii ana, (aole nae i maopopo ka manawa).

A penei ka moolelo no ia hoouka kaua ana i hoopau wale ai.","When he was well advanced in life and unable to walk, he ordered his servants to make him a network of strings (koko). And in accordance with the wish of Kualii his servants proceeded to carry it out. In the engagement of Kualii here on Oahu, against the chiefs from Koolauloa, sometime after the reign of Kakuhihewa over Oahu, or possibly at a time prior to the reign of Kakuhihewa (the exact time not being very clearly ascertained), which engagement was to be upon the plains of Keahumoa at Honouliuli, Ewa, he was carried by his men in a network of strings. No actual fighting occurred, however, as the two armies upon coming together entered into a declaration of peace. The number of men under Kualii in this contest was three mano, which is equal to twelve thousand, and the number of men comprising the other army was three lau, which is equal to twelve hundred; and the reason why the battle was not fought is told in the following story."
"O Kapaahulani ka mua, a o kona kaikaina o Kamakaaulani, he mau kanaka imi haku laua, a na laua i haku i mele, a holo, hooili i ka inoa no Kualii.

A penei ka laua olelo kuka hope, oiai o laua wale.","Kapaahulani the elder and his younger brother Kamakaaulani were men who were in search of a new master or lord, so they composed a mele, or chant, and after it was completed placed it to Kualii as his name. Shortly after the two men had completed [ ] the mele they held a conference as to the proper course for them to follow in order that they might both reap equal benefit. Following is how they decided which course to pursue while all by themselves and before the mele was made public: “Since we have composed and completed this mele, you (Kamakaaulani) must therefore go and give its name to Kualii, and I (Kapaahulani) will go to the other chief and urge him to make war upon Kualii. And when we become acquainted of the place where the battle is to be fought then you are to take Kualii to the place and there conceal yourselves in the bushes. You are to leave a mark on the road, however, so that I may be informed of your being there. I will then stand and chant this mele that we have just composed.” After completing their arrangement, Kamakaaulani gave out the mele which was known as the name of Kualii. Some considerable time after this, these two brothers again got together and decided upon the time when they should bring about what they had agreed upon. The following is what they said at this last meeting while by themselves:"
"Kamakaaulani: “E hele oe a ke alii o Koolauloa, lawe mai oe, a ma ke kula o Keahumoa, malaila makou e pee ai, alaila, i hele mai oukou, a i ike oe i ka lai i nipuu ia, a me ka hiu ia aholehole e waiho ana maluna o ka puu ainako, alaila, e manao oe, o makou ia, alaila, e ku ae no oe a kahea ae i ua mele la. Aia nae a hiki i na po i o Kane a ao ae, e loaa no makou ma ke kula o Keahumoa.” A holo ka laua olelo, alaila, hele aku la o Kapaahulani e launa me ke alii o Koolauloa. I kekahi manawa o Kapaahulani ma Waialua, oiai e noho ana ke alii o Koolauloa malaila ia manawa, hoolauna aku la o Kapaahulani i ke alii, me ke koi aku e kii e kaua ia Kualii.","Kamakaaulani: “You go to the chief of Koolauloa and bring him to the plains of Keahumoa where we will conceal ourselves. When you see a knotted ti leaf and the tail of a small fish (aholehole) on a pile of sugar-cane peelings, then remember that it is the sign that we are there and you can stand on that spot and chant the mele. This must, however, be on the eve of Kane. You will find us on the plains of Keahumoa.” As soon as this was agreed upon, Kapaahulani proceeded on his way to meet the chief of Koolauloa. When Kapaahulani reached Waialua where the chief of Koolauloa had come and was residing for the time being, soon after his arrival there he introduced himself to the chief, and thereupon urged him to go and make war on Kualii."
"I kekahi ahiahi, i na kahuna a ke alii e nana ana i na ouli o ka lani, i mea e maopopo ai ko lakou lanakila ana maluna o Kualii, aka, i ka nana ana a na kahuna kilokilo lani, ua maopopo, aole e lanakila ana ko lakou puali maluna o Kualii. A lohe aku la o Kapaahulani i keia olelo a na kahuna a ke alii o Koolau, alaila olelo aku la oia i kekahi kamaaina e pili ana i ke alii: “E hele oe a ke alii, e hai aku oe i ka’u olelo ua lalau ka ike a na kahuna a ke alii.” A no keia olelo a Kapaahulani, alaila, laweia aku la ka lohe o keia olelo imua o ke alii, a hai ia aku la me ka i aku nae: “E ke alii, ua olelo mai nei kela kanaka (Kapaahulani) ua lalau ka ike a na kahuna au.” I mai la ke alii: “E kii oe i ua kanaka la, e hele mai e olelo i kana mea i kamailio mai nei ia oe.”","On a certain evening while the priests and the chief were watching the heavens in order to discover if they could defeat Kualii, the astrologers, after a careful study, were certain that their army would not be able to overcome the army of Kualii. When Kapaahulani heard the decision arrived at by the priests of the chief of Koolauloa, he remarked to one of the chief’s attendants: “You go to the chief and tell him for me that his priests are mistaken in their interpretations.” Upon hearing this remark made by Kapaahulani, the man went and said to the chief: “O Chief, that man (Kapaahulani) has just said that your priests are mistaken in their interpretations.” The chief replied: “You go and bring that man to me. Let him come and say what he has told you.”"
"Alaila, kiiia aku la o Kapaahulani, a laweia mai la imua o ke alii, ninau aku la: “He oiaio anei, ua olelo mai nei oe, ua lalau ka ike a kuu mau kahuna?” I aku la o Kapaahulani i ke alii: “Ae, he oiaio, ua lalau ka ike a ko mau kahuna; aka, ma ko’u ike ma ko’u ano kahuna nui, e like me ka mea i aoia ia’u mai ko’u mau kupuna mai a hiki ia’u, he lalau io no ka ike a ua mau kahuna nei a ke alii.” [ ] A no keia mea, olelo aku la ke alii ia Kapaahulani: “Pehea hoi kau ike? E pono ke olelo mai.” Olelo aku la o Kapaahulani i ke alii: “O ka’u ike, ina e kii kakou e kaua ia Kualii, alaila, e lanakila no kakou maluna o ia kaua. Ke manao nei wau, ina e kii kakou i ka la apopo ia Kualii, a i halawai kakou me ke kaua i ka ehu kakahiaka, hoomoe wale ke kaua i ke awakea. A ina hoi i halawai kakou me ke kaua i ke awakea, alaila, hee ia kakou i ka ehu ahiahi.”","Kapaahulani was then sent for and he was brought in the presence of the chief, who asked him: “Is it true that you have said that my priests are mistaken in their interpretations?” Kapaahulani replied to the chief: “Yes, it is true your priests are [ ] mistaken in their interpretations; because according to what I have seen, being also a great priest, and in accordance with the knowledge gathered by my ancestors and handed to me by them, your priests have indeed made a mistake in their interpretations to you, O Chief.” Upon hearing this the chief asked Kapaahulani: “What are your interpretations then? It is proper that you relate them.” Kapaahulani then replied to the chief: “My interpretations are these: If we go and make war upon Kualii, we will be victorious in that battle. I believe that if we could go and make war upon Kualii tomorrow, and it should happen that we meet him in the early morning, that by noon the battle would not be fought; but if we happen to meet his army at noon time we would defeat him early in the evening.”"
"A no keia mea, hoolale ae la ke alii i na puali koa he ekolu lau (umi kumamalua haneri), ka nui o na koa, e hoomakaukau no ka hele i ke kaua. Ma ia po, hele ae la lakou a uka o Lihue, a malaila mai a iho i Honouliuli, a hiki lakou i ke kula o Keahumoa, oia ka hoomaka ana mai a ka la e puka.

Nolaila, e kuu ae wau i kuu pule a i maikai kuu pule i keia kakahiaka, pakele kakou, aka, i kuu wau i kuu pule, a i ino kuu pule i keia la, pau kakou i ka make.”","Because of these remarks, the chief thereupon ordered his men, amounting to three lau (twelve hundred) to get ready to go to war. That night they went to the upper part of Lihue, and from there on down to Honouliuli, till they arrived on the plains of Keahumoa, just as the sun was coming up. At this same time Kapaahulani saw the mark agreed upon by him and his brother. He then rushed to the front of the army to the chief warriors and spoke to the people in the chief’s immediate circle as follows: “Say, Nuunewa (the chief warrior), we are surrounded by the enemy. I had thought that we would be the victors if we arrived here first, but I see that we are surrounded. Therefore I will chant my prayer, and if it should be acceptable this morning, we will be saved; but if I chant my prayer and it should end badly this day, then we will all be killed.”"
"A no keia olelo a Kapaahulani, olelo ko’a mai la na kahuna o ke alii me ka i mai: “He mea kupanaha! Olelo mai nei hoi oe ia kakou, aole kakou e puni ana i ke kaua, na kakou ke kaua e hiki mua ma keia wahi; eia ka hoi, ua puni iho nei kakou i ke kaua.”","Because of these remarks spoken by Kapaahulani, the chief’s priests spoke up saying: “It does seem strange. You told us that we would not be surrounded by the enemy, and that we would be victorious if we were to reach this place first; but it now turns out that we are surrounded by the enemy.”"
"I mai ke alii: “Ua oki ka oukou olelo, ua kuu ae nei kakou i ke ola, a me ka make o ka puali ia ia nei. Nolaila e pono paha kakou e hoolohe i ka ia nei olelo. A ina he oiaio ka ia nei e olelo nei, ua puni ka kakou i ke kaua, alaila o kona pono no hoi ia a me kona waiwai; aka, he wahahee na ia nei, alaila, eia kuu olelo paa maluna o ia nei: e make ia nei, a make mai me kona hanauna, o ka ohi no ia o ka make a hiki i kona poe hoaikane mai.”","The chief then spoke up: “Stop your remarks. We have staked the life and death of the army in his keeping, therefore we must abide by what he says. If what he says is true, that we are indeed surrounded by the enemy, then it will redound to his own good, and he shall be rewarded. But in case he lies and is deceiving us, then my firm command as to his treatment is this: he shall die, and all his relations also, and death shall gather up even those who befriend him.”"
"Ia manawa, ku ae la o Kapaahulani imua o ka huakai, a pule aku la, ma ke mele a laua i haku ai me kona kaikaina. [ ]",Kapaahulani then stood up in the presence of the army and prayed by chanting the mele composed by him and his brother. [ ]
"I loko o keia wa a Kapaahulani e heluhelu la i keia pauku, i mai la ka pukaua o Kualii iaia: “E apa ana kakou i keia kaua i ke aha? Kai noa he hoouka ae ka kakou i keia wahi kaua uuku.” Ia manawa olelo aku o Kamakaaulani, ke kaikaina o Kapaahulani, i ka pukaua: “E kali paha ka hoouka o ke kaua, ke loaa mai la hoi ka [ ] inoa o ke alii; nolaila e pono kakau ke kali aku; ina i hana mai kela i ko Kualii mau kupuna mai ka po mai a hiki ia ianei (Kualii) alaila e hookuu aku, aole e kaua.” A e like me ka olelo a Kamakaaulani, pela no o Kualii i hoolohe ai. Aka, o Kapaahulani, aole oia i hooki i kana hana ana i keia mele, ka mea i kapaia he pule.","While Kapaahulani was chanting this section of the mele Kualii’s chief officer remarked to the king: “Why are we delaying this battle? Why not let us fight out this small battle?” Kamakaaulani, the brother of Kapaahulani, then spoke to the chief officer: “Let us perhaps delay the battle. I hear the king’s name is being mentioned; [ ] therefore it is but proper that we wait. If he can rightly name Kualii’s ancestors from the beginning right down to him (Kualii), then we should let them go, and there will be no fighting.” Kualii, by his silence, showed that he would abide by the words spoken by Kamakaaulani. In the meantime Kapaahulani continued on with his chanting of the mele, called a prayer."
"I keia manawa, a Kapaahulani i hea ai: “E ku mai oe i ka hea, i ka ualo, mai hookuli mai oe.” Ma keia kaukau ana, ia manawa ku mai la o Kualii me ka paa i ke koko; na Kualii i ku mai, hele pu mai la me na koa o na aoao elua o ko Kualii puali no; i nana aku auanei ke kaua o Koolauloa mai, aole i kana mai a ka nui o ke kaua a Kualii. Ia manawa, iniki aku, iniki mai ka puali o Koolauloa mai, me ka olelo iho: “Ike wale ke kahuna; eia ka ua puni io kakou i ke kaua.” Alaila ia wa, ke nalu la na pukaua o ko Koolauloa kaua mai i ka pilikia.","When Kapaahulani reached that portion in his chant where it says, “Stand forth at the call, at the pleading; turn not a deaf ear,” Kualii was raised up while still in the netting. As he was being held up, the soldiers of the two wings of his army also stood up. When the warriors from Koolauloa looked about them and saw that Kualii had a very large army, they nudged back and forth and remarked to one another: “The priest is indeed wise; here we are indeed surrounded by the enemy.” At this same time the chief warriors of the Koolauloa army were thinking of the trouble they had gotten into."
"I kela manawa a Kualii e amo ia la iloko o ke koko, aole nae i hooki o Kapaahulani i kona kahea ana i ka inoa o Kualii, nokamea, o kana kahea ana mai no mai kinohi mai, o kana hea iho la no ia me ka hoomaha ole a hiki i ka hui ana o na kaua elua. Ia Kualii i kela manawa, hea mai la o Kapaahulani ma ka hoohalike ana ia Kualii i mea e like ai, aole nae he mea e like ai. Aka, o ka mea i like ai o Kualii ma ka hoohalike ana, o Keaweikekahialiiokamoku ke alii o Hawaii. Nokamea, ua oleloia, he akua o Kualii. Ina e hele o Kualii mai Kahaluu aku a hiki i Waialua, maloko o ke kai, alaila maloo ke kohola.","While Kualii was being held up in the koko, standing amidst his warriors, Kapaahulani still kept on chanting the mele of Kualii, never once stopping to rest, from the time he began it until both armies met. When Kapaahulani saw Kualii he endeavored to find some one with whom he could compare Kualii, but try as he would he was unable to find any one worthy of comparison except Keaweikekahialiiokamoku, the king of Hawaii. The reason of this was because Kualii was compared to a god. When Kualii walked from Kahaluu to Waialua by way of the sea, the sea within the reef would dry up."
"A o Keaweikekahialiiokamoku hoi, ina e holo oia me kona mau kanaka i ka lawaia, a ina i makewai na hoewaa, alaila, olelo aku ia Keawe: “E! makewai makou.” Alaila ukuhi ae la na hoewaa i ke kai iloko o ka waa, alaila hoi ala mai la hoi o Keawe, mai luna mai o ka pola o na waa a noho i ka noho-ana, hoolei loa na wawae iloko o ke kaina liu, alaila, ua manalo koke ke kai, a lilo iho la i wai no na hoewaa; pela i lilo ai o Kualii i mea like me Keaweikekahialiiokamoku.","Keaweikekahialiiokamoku, on the other hand, when out fishing with his men and ran out of water would turn salt water into fresh. When his paddlers became thirsty they would tell Keawe: “Say, we are thirsty.” The paddlers would then dip up the sea and pour it into the canoe, and Keawe would get up from the covered seat between the two canoes and sit in one of the seats; then he would stretch out his legs in the sea water that had been poured into the canoe, and the sea water would lose its saltness and become fresh, and the paddlers would then use it for drinking purposes. This was the reason why Kualii was compared to Keaweikekahialiiokamoku."

Fornander refers to it in his Polynesian Race, Vol. II, p. 284, but does not append it in his republication of the song, with a somewhat different interpretation as an Appendix in said Volume II, from the fact that he questioned its genuineness. Not doubting his judgment in the case, it serves here as a further tribute, at a later period possibly, to the name and fame of Kualii by a historian of his race.— Ed. ]"

The king of Koolauloa then gave over, or ceded, the districts of Koolauloa, Koolaupoko, Waialua and Waianae. When the king of Kauai heard how Kualii excelled over all the others in war, and how he had gained the victory at the battle of Honouliuli on the plains of Keahumoa, he came to meet Kualii and gave him Kauai, and by this act Kualii became possessed of all the islands from Hawaii to Niihau.

After the presents were loaded into several large double canoes, they were sent out to meet Kamakaaulani who was then at Puuloa, and there the presents were given him."
"A o Kamakaaulani hoi, mamua o ko laua hookaawale ana ia laua, ua kuka mua no laua i kahi e noho ai o Kamakaaulani, mahope iho o ka hoomoe ana o ke kaua; a nolaila no i noho ai o Kamakaaulani ma Puuloa, mamuli o ka laua kuka mua ana.

This was why Kamakaaulani resided at Puuloa, that being the place agreed upon by them. Thus by this conduct of theirs both sides were deceived through their duplicity."
"Ia Kapaahulani i hoi ai me ke alii i Waialua mahope iho o ka haalele ana ia Waianae, i aku la ke alii ia Kapaahulani: “Pehea na aina a’u i haawi aku ai ia oe i ka la i hoomoe ai ke kaua i kula o Keahumoa?” I aku la o Kapaahulani: “E ke alii, aole o’u manao aina, aole no hoi kekahi mea e ae.

I do not care for the lands nor for anything else. The only thing I want you to give me is to have the general care of your store houses.” When the king saw that Kapaahulani had made the proper answer in the matter, he was thereupon made chief steward over the store houses in the name of the king."
"Alaila, o ka hana a ua Kapaahulani nei, iaia ma ke ano puuku nui no ka halepapaa, o ka hoouna mau i na mea a pau ma ka halepapaa no kona kaikaina no Kamakaaulani.

Uli was the grandmother. Hamakualoa, Maui, was the land in which Kana was born, and Halauoloolo was the name of the house. At the birth of Kana, he was in the form of a piece of rope; he had no human form. After the birth of Kana, Uli took and kept it until it assumed a human form, then she brought the child up. The place where Kana was brought up was in Piihonua, Hilo, Hawaii, a place lying to the East of Wailuku, where his house was built, called Halauoloolo."
"O keia puu o Haupu, he puu ia aia i Molokai; o ke ’lii o luna o ua puu la, o Kapepeekauila ka inoa, o ke kahuna o Moi.

Pane mai o Kana: “Heaha kau?” Olelo aku o Hakalanileo: “I hele mai nei au e hai aku ia oe, ua lilo ka makuahine o olua ia Kapepeekauila, ke ’lii o ka puu o Haupu, aia i Molokai kahi i noho ai i keia wa.”","This hill called Haupu, was a hill situated on Molokai and the chief who lived on this hill was Kapepeekauila by name and his chief priest was known by the name of Moi. Once upon a time this hill, Haupu, moved or floated to Mokuola in Hilo, Hawaii, carrying along the chief and the people and the things that grew on the hill. When Hina the mother of Kana and Niheu saw that the land was pleasant to the eye, she climbed on up the hill with the idea of taking a look at the place. As soon as Hina was on the hill of Haupu, it immediately moved back to Molokai, thus leaving Hakalanileo to mourn for her loss. When Hakalanileo saw that his wife was being carried away he tried to recover her, but found it impossible to do so. After his failure, he proceeded to Niheu and informed him that Hina had been taken away by the hill of Haupu. When Niheu heard this report from his father, he said: “I cannot get her, there is only one person who can do it, and that is Kana. You must go to him personally; don’t be afraid of him and run away if he should turn and look at you. Just [ ] keep your eyes away from him.” After Niheu had given these instructions to Hakalanileo, Hakalanileo turned and went to meet Kana. When Hakalanileo came to where Kana was living, Kana turned and looked at him and the sight of Kana was so terrible that he turned and attempted to run away; but Kana called out to him, saying: “What do you want?” Hakalanileo replied: “I have come to tell you that the mother of you two has been taken away by Kapepeekauila, the chief of the hill of Haupu. She is now at Molokai.”"
"A lohe o Kana, olelo mai la ia ia Hakalanileo: “O hoi e kukala ia Hawaii a puni, e kalai i mau waa no kakou e holo ai i Molokai, i loaa ko wahine.” Ma keia olelo o Kana, ua akoakoa na kalai waa o Hawaii a puni, he mau waa nunui, he umi ka loa; a makaukau na waa, kii aku la o Hakalanileo ia Kana e holo i Molokai. Ia wa, kikoo na lima o Kana a luna o na waa, o ke komo iho la no ia o na waa a poho i lalo, aole i ee ke kino o Kana. Nolaila, olelo hou o Kana ia Hakalanileo, e kalai hou na waa; kalai hou no o Hawaii a puni, a loaa elua waa, i na lima no o Kana komo, nolaila, aohe waa e holo ai i Molokai. Nolaila, hele aku la o Hakalanileo i mua o Niheu a olelo aku la no keia mau mea, a lohe o Niheu, olelo mai la: “O hele a ia Uli, olelo aku i waa; aia ia ia ka waa e hiki ai i Molokai, nana e kuhikuhi mai ia oe.”","When Kana heard this, he said to Hakalanileo: “Go and issue a call that the people come together throughout Hawaii, and instruct the men to go and hew out canoes, by which we will get to Molokai, and get back your wife.” With this, the canoe hewers all around Hawaii came together and a large double canoe of ten [fathoms] in length was hewed out and made ready, whereupon Hakalanileo went for Kana to voyage to Molokai. When Kana came to the double canoe he stretched out his hands and placed them on the canoe and the canoe sunk out of sight; Kana did not even attempt to board the canoe. Because of this, Kana said to Hakalanileo: “Go and hew out another double canoe.” Again the people of Hawaii went up and hewed out another double canoe; but the hands of Kana alone were too much for the canoe, for it too sunk out of sight, thus leaving them without a canoe to get to Molokai in. Therefore, Hakalanileo went to the presence of Niheu and reported the matter to him. When Niheu heard this, he said: “You go to Uli and ask for a canoe; she has the canoe that will take you to Molokai, and she will direct you what to do.”"
"A hiki o Hakalanileo i mua o Uli, ninau mai la Uli: “Heaha kau?” I aku o Hakalanileo: “I hele mai nei au i waa no Kana, e holo ai i Molokai, e kaua me Kapepeekauila, ke ’lii o luna o ka puu o Haupu.” I mai o Uli: “Ae, he waa, aia i Paliuli; e hele nae oe e kukala i na kanaka a pau loa, e kii e kauo mai i na waa.” Hele aku la o Hakalanileo e kukala i na kanaka a pau loa, a akoakoa, he mau lau kanaka ewalu. Ia wa, pii lakou a hiki i uka o Paliuli. Hooulu o Uli i kana mele pule no na waa o Kana.","When Hakalanileo came in the presence of Uli, she asked him: “What is it you want?” Hakalanileo replied: “I have come for a canoe for Kana by which he may be able to get to Molokai to fight Kapepeekauila, the chief that lives on the Haupu hill.” Uli made reply: “Yes, there is a canoe, it is in Paliuli; but you must, however, go and call all the people together to go and drag down the canoes.” Hakalanileo did so and collected eight times forty men, and they proceeded to the uplands of Paliuli, where Uli prayed for a double canoe for Kana."
"A pau ka hooulu ana a Uli, ia wa, olelo o Uli, e kohi i lalo o ka lepo; kohi iho la na kanaka me ka hoomaauea, me ka manao ole he oiaio ka Uli olelo. Ia lakou e kohi ana ike mua ae lakou i ka manu o na waa e hoea ae ana mai ka lepo ae.

The men then began to dig without any interest thinking there was no truth in the words of Uli. While the people were digging they came, first upon the sticks at the bow and stern of the canoe, the points that first came to their view, and when the body of the double canoe and all the parts were exposed, Uli gave orders that the people may return, for they were shivering with the cold, from the rain and thunder which had continued all through the time occupied in the digging, so that they were exhausted."
"A hoi na kanaka a pau loa, alaila, hapai ke ’kua i na waa, ia Kaumaielieli a lana i loko o ke kai, lawe mai la a hiki ma Kaipalaoa, e kupono ana i Wailuku a me Piihonua, kahi o Kana e noho ana.","After the people had all returned, the double canoe, Kaumaielieli, was then lifted by the gods and carried down and placed in the sea; and from this point it was taken to Kaipalaoa, directly below Wailuku and Piihonua, where Kana was living."
"Ia Kana a me Niheu e makaukau ana e holo mai maluna o na waa o Kaumaielieli, e kaua me Kapepeekauila ke ’lii o luna o ka puu a Haupu, ua loaa mua ia Moi ka moe uhane mamua o ka holo ana mai o Kana ma i Molokai.

Iloko o na po o Kane, loaa ia ia ka moe uhane, penei ke ano o kana mea i ike ai:","While Kana and Niheu were making their preparations to sail on the double canoe, Kaumaielieli, to do battle with Kapepeekauila, the chief on the top of Haupu hill, Moi dreamed a dream. This dream was before the start was made by Kana for Molokai. Moi was the priest to the chief Kapepeekauila on the top of Haupu hill. He was a very great priest, learned in his profession and was all powerful; his predictions always coming true, whether in the interpretation of dreams or in the foretelling of coming events. In the night of Kane, he dreamed a dream, which was this:"
"MOEUHANE. He kanaka loa, he kanaka poko, He ui-aa-he alaneo, A na maka pa i ka lani, Malu ka honua, Ia Kamauhili e! Hee nei Ku, I ka moe au a ke kahuna.","THE DREAM. A long man, a short man; A stunted youth, a male god. The eyes touched the heaven, The earth was overshadowed. Say Kamauhili, Ku is routed. Such is my dream, the priest."
"A, ao ae, olelo aku o Moi i ke ’lii ia Kapepeekauila: “E, he moe ka’u i ka po nei.” I mai ke ’lii: “E hai mai.” Hai aku la o Moi i ka moe i olelo ia maluna, a pau ka hai ana, wehewehe aku la i ke ano o ka moe, aole nae he manao io o ke ’lii i keia olelo a Moi. Nolaila, olelo aku o Moi i kana olelo wanana ike, i mua o ke ’lii a me na kanaka: “Ina he hoomoloka i ka moe a’u a ke kahuna, he au hulihia kona hope; ina he wahine ke hoomaloka i ka moe a’u a ke kahuna, he mai kona e moe ia, he wahine ia no Kupukupu, o lou ka nuku o Kolea ma, kau ana i luna o Halehuki. He kanaka loihi ka’u i ike, a oia ka mea nana i hahaki na hui o Haupu nei, a helelei aku nei a ku i loko o ke kai, nolaila, e hele oi la honua ka make.”","At daylight the next day, Moi said to the chief, Kapepeekauila: “Say, I had a dream last night.” The chief said: “Tell me what it is.” Moi then told him of the dream as related above. After telling the dream, Moi gave an interpretation of its meaning, but the chief would not believe it. Seeing this, Moi prophesied to the chief and people, saying: “If you are not going to take heed to my warning, the priest, you will surely be dispossessed. If it is a woman that is unbelieving, she shall make a poor marriage, a woman is she of Kupukupu she will be hooked up by the bill of the duck and left on the height of Halihuki. I saw a long man, and it was by him that the borders of Haupu were broken and the hill fell to pieces into the sea; therefore depart now while death is yet at a distance.”"
"Hoole mai o Kapepeekauila: “O oe no ko’u mea e make ai e na kahuna wahahee; aohe mea e pio ai ko’u puu o Haupu nei; a heaha la hoi, ina i make ole kuu puu ma [ ] keia hope aku, alaila, make oe ia’u.” I aku o Moi: “Ae, he nani ia, ua lohe ole ae la no oe i ka’u olelo, a ua paa iho la no oe i kou manao; heaha la hoi, he ala ike ko kahuna, aole e loaa i ka hookolo ia.”","Kapepeekauila refused to take heed of this warning, saying: “You are the one I shall cause to die, you deceiving priest. My hill of Haupu shall never be conquered. However, let it stand; if my hill is not conquered in the coming fight, I will kill you.” [ ] Moi then replied: “Yes, well and good. Since you would not accept my warning and you have made up your mind in the matter, let it be as you will. The paths of the priests are narrow and can never be reached by crawling.”"
"O ko Moi wahi i noho ai a hele, o ka lapalapa pali hikina o Waikolu, e waiho la ma Molokai a hiki i keia la; aia no hoi kona alanui ma ka pali nihinihi lele loa kahi i kau ai, a malalo o laila ke kai hula ana o Waikolu, a ke waiho nei no ia wahi a hiki i keia la.","The place where Moi dwelt and traversed is along the cliff ridge east of Waikolu, Molokai, and can be seen to this day; its pathway is along this steep cliff, below which are the waters of the Waikolu sea, and the place remains to the present time."
"A lohe ke ’lii o Kapepeekauila i keia olelo a Moi, hoouna aku la ia i kana mau kukini mama loa, o Kolea, o Ulili, e lele e nana ia Kana a me Niheu.

When the two came to the harbor of Punahoa, in Hilo, a place adjoining Kaipalaoa, where Kana was then living, Kolea said to Ulili: “Say, let us fly away up high so as to be out of the reach of Kana, and from up there, call out to him.” The two then flew away up high and at a point directly over the place where Kana was sleeping, they called out to Kana. When Kana heard the call he reached up with his hands, while still lying down, but did not catch them, though the effects of the wind caused by the hands of Kana made them swing away in haste, and in doing this they fell down on the hill of Haupu in Molokai. When the two birds came in the presence of Kapepeekauila, they told of the man with such long arms that they reached into the heavens, and that they barely escaped death. When the chief heard the report of the two birds, he sent Kolea and Ulili to go and tell Keauleinakahi, his warrior who had charge of the ocean."
"O Keauleinakahi, he koa ia no Kapepeekauila, ke ’lii o luna o ka puu o Haupu, e hiki ia ia ke hou i ka waa a puka pu, ma kekahi aoao, oia kela auau hou i ka waa a me na mea e ae. Ua kauoha ia ia e hou aku i na waa o Kaumaielieli, ke holo mai mai Hawai mai, a e pepehi ia Kana a me Niheu.","Keauleinakahi was one of the warriors under Kapepeekauila and it could thrust through a canoe with his snout. This fish is to be seen to this day. It has a long sharp snout and can kill a man or wreck a canoe or other object. When the messengers came to Keauleinakahi, they said: “You have been ordered to pierce the double canoe, Kaumaielieli, when it comes from Hawaii and also to kill Kana and Niheu.”"
"A ee o Kana a me Niheu i luna o na waa o Kaumaielieli, a me ko laua makuakane o Hakalanileo, a holo mai la o Kana, ua opeope ia a kau i luna o ka pola o na waa, e like me ka loihi o na waa o Kaumaielieli, pela no ko Kana waiho ana.

Ia ia e makaukau ana e lele mai e hou, ku ana o Niheu me kana laau palau, o Wawaikalani ka inoa, a hahau aku la ia Keauleinakahi, a make iho la ia.","On the day when Kana and Niheu completed their preparations, they boarded the canoe, Kaumaielieli, taking along with them their father Hakalanileo, and set sail. Kana was wrapped up in the form of a large package, and was placed on the platform. The length of the package extended the full length of the double canoe. While they were on their way and had reached a point between Hawaii and Maui, they were met by Keauleinakahi, the warrior of Kapepeekauila, who made an attack on the double canoe, with the intention of breaking it to pieces with his sharp snout. While it was preparing for the attack, Niheu stood up with his war club, Wawaikalani by name; and as Keauleinakahi made the attack, Niheu struck it with his club, killing it."
"Holo mai la lakou a hiki i Waikolu ma Molokai, kahi e ku ana ka puu o Haupu, hekau iho la na waa i waho. Ia lakou e lana pono ana ma waho ae o Waikolu, olokaa ia mai la kekahi pohaku nui mai luna mai o ka puu o Haupu, maluna pono o na waa o Kaumaielieli.

Make kakou!!” Ma keia kahea ana, ua lohe o Kana, lalau ae la kona lima akau a paa i ka pohaku, o ka lima hema, lalau aku la ma ka poina kai, i iliili kia [ ] no ka pohaku i paa; ma keia hana a Kana, ua paa loa ia pohaku i waena o ka pali a hiki i keia la, e waiho la ma ka pali o Waikolu.

Mahope olaila, kii o Niheu i ka makuahine i luna o ka puu o Haupu, mamuli o kona koa a me kona ikaika.","After this encounter the voyage was resumed until they arrived at Waikolu, Molokai, near where the Haupu hill was standing, and here the canoe was moored. While they were mooring the canoe a large rock was rolled down from the hill aimed at the canoe Kaumaielieli. As Kana was lying on the platform of the canoe, one of the people called out, saying: “Say, there comes a large rock! A large rock is coming!! We will be killed! We will be killed!!” At this call Kana heard it, so he reached out his right hand and held the rock, while with the left hand he reached for a small [ ] stone from the beach and placed it under the rock, stopping it from rolling any further. By this action of Kana the rock was stopped right in the middle of the steep cliff; and it is there to this day, on the cliff of Waikolu. This saved Kana and the canoe Kaumaielieli from destruction by the rock. After this Niheu started off for the top of the Haupu hill, to the rescue of his mother, believing that he could do this with his own strength."
"He koa makau ole o Niheu a he koa wiwo ole i ko hai ikaika, a he hiki ia ia ke hoouka kaua me ka lehulehu, me kona kanalua ole. Lalau aku la ia i kana laau palau o Wawaikalani, a hoomoe aku la mai na waa a hiki i ka pali, hele aku la o Niheu maluna.

He was so brave that he oftentimes fought against a whole army, without the least hesitation. When he was ready to start he took up his war club, Wawaikalani, and placing one end of it on the cliff, the other resting on the canoe, he walked ashore upon it. After landing he proceeded to the top of the hill of Haupu, where the chief Kapepeekauila was living, in company with Hina, the mother of Niheu, who was for the time being his wife."
"O Kahonunuimaeleka ka inoa o Haupu, he honu, me na aoao o ka puu o Haupu, ina e upai na hui, alaila, pii ua puu nei i luna a kiekie i ka lani. He pa ma waho o ka puu o Haupu, he pae humu ka inoa, oia ke ki o Koaea a me ka ulei o Nuuhiwa, aole e komo ka makani i loko o ka hale o ke ’lii, o ia o Halehuki. E hili aku ana o Niheu i ka laau palau ana, pau ke ki o Koaea, a me ka ulei o Nuuhiwa, komo ka makani i loko o Halehuki.","The real name of the hill was Kahonunuimaeleka, a turtle, and had flippers on the sides. Whenever these flippers closed the hill would extend up to the heaven. Around this hill was a fence called Paehumu composed of ti-leaf of Koaea and the ulei of Nuuhiwa. These things grew so close together that they served as a windbreak, and no wind could touch the chief’s house, called Halehuki."
"Ia wa ninau ke ’lii o Kapepeekauila: “Ea, heaha keia mea e komo nei ka makani i loko nei?” “He keiki me ka laau palau, nana e hili mai nei ke ki o Koaea, a me ka ulei o Nuuhiwa.” Olelo mai o Hina: “O Niheu, o ke keiki koa a maua; he keiki makau ole keia, make kakou.” I Hina e kamailio ana, hiki ana o Niheu a lalau ia Hina, a lawe aku la. Mamua ae o ka lawe ana o Niheu ia Hina, ua hai aku o Hina ia Kolea laua o Ulili i ko Niheu wahi e ikaika ai, o ia ka wili lauoho o ke poo o Niheu, o Wilikalinoamohalaikaekaeka ka inoa; e lalau a paa ka wili lauoho, alaila, haalele ia’u, pela e nawaliwali ai o Niheu.","When Niheu came up to the fence he beat down the ti-leaf and ulei with his war club, causing the wind to enter Halehuki. As the wind blew into the house, Kapepeekauila asked: “What has caused the wind to enter here?” “There is a boy outside with a war club. He has beaten down the fence.” Hina then spoke up: “It must be Niheu, our brave son. He is without fear. We shall be killed.” While she was speaking, Niheu came in and taking hold of Hina started off with her. Before Niheu came into the house, Hina had told Kolea and Ulili the place wherein the strength of Niheu laid; it being in the strands of his hair, called Wilikalinoamohalaikaekaeka, and at the same time told them to take hold of the strands and pull on them which will cause Niheu to let go of her, for this would cause him to lose his strength."
"A ike o Kolea a me Ulili, ua lilo o Hina, lele iho la laua a paa i ka wili lauoho o Niheu; a ike o Niheu ua paa kona lauoho, haalele iho la ia ia Hina, a hopu iho la i kana laau palau, a hahau ia Kolea ma laua o Ulili; ia ia i lilo ai i laila, holo aku la o Hina a hiki i ka hale, me ke kane o Kapepeekauila.

Ma keia oni ana o Kana, ua hiki i ka lanikuakea, ka lani lipolipo, ua punawelewele nae ke kino o Kana, no ka pololei i ka make a ka ai, a me ka ia.","When Kolea and Ulili saw that Hina was being taken away, they flew and held Niheu by the hair. When Niheu saw that his hair was being held, he let go of Hina, took up his war club and struck at Kolea and Ulili. While he was doing this, Hina ran back to the house, to her new husband Kapepeekauila; Niheu, therefore, walked back to the canoe, and he was questioned by Kana as follows: “How about our mother?” Niheu replied: “I had her and we were on our way here when I was attacked; my hair was pulled by the two birds, Kolea and Ulili. While I was beating them off, Hina ran back again.” Kana then said to Niheu: “You stay here on our canoe while I go after our mother.” With this Kana stood up in the canoe and peeped over the hill of Haupu. At this the hill extended on up and Kana also extended on upward too. In doing this [ ] Kana had to go up to the highest heaven, in the deep blue sky and his body was in the form of a spider’s webb, for he was in great need of food and meat."
"Nolaila, nana ae la o Niheu ma na wawae o Kana, i ka punawelewele a me ka wiwi loa, a noonoo iho la ia, he make pololi.

When Kana heard the call of Niheu, he bent himself over across Molokai, over the top of Haleakala, over the mountain whereby a groove was formed across Haleakala which can be seen to this day."

[ ]","When Kana reached Kona and the home of Uli his grandmother, he laid down by the doorway until Uli awoke in the morning, and when she came out she saw Kana, her grandson. She then woke him up and began feeding him. When Kana was satisfied, the increase of his body began to come down until it reached his feet which were in the canoe, where Niheu was still waiting. When Niheu looked and saw that the legs were increasing he arose and cut off one, for he was angry with Kana for eating till satisfied. The numbness from this cut went up until it reached the head of Kana, and upon informing his grandmother of this fact, Uli said: “Your younger brother Niheu got angry with you because you partook of food [without remembering him], so he has cut off one of your legs.” After this Uli said to Kana: “You have conquered over your opponent. When you rise up you must extend upward until you tower above the Haupu hill, then make eyes at the hill and when it extends up to meet you, you reach down and break off the flippers on the right side; then break off the flippers on the left side; then it will have no more strength.” After these instructions had been imparted, Kana arose and stood upright until he towered over Haupu, when he made eyes at the hill. At seeing this Haupu extended upward to meet Kana; Kana then reached down and broke off the flippers. As soon as the flippers were broken, the power of Haupu ceased. Kana then stepped down on the hill and it fell to pieces, and as the pieces fell into the sea, they were left there in the form of small hills, which can be seen to this day, at the mouth of the Waikolu Valley, overgrown with loulou palms. By the death of Haupu, the chief Kapepeekauila was conquered and Hina was recovered; and she was brought back to live with her first husband Hakalanileo. This ended the war between Kana and the Haupu hill. [ ]"
"O Alala ka makuakane, o Koukou ka makuahine, o Iole, o Opeapea na kaikuahine o Pikoiakaalala, he mau mua laua ma ka hanau ana no Pikoiakaalala. Olelo hoakaka.

The parents as well as the children were rats who sometimes changed into human beings, as this story will clearly show. Wailua in Kauai was the birthplace of Pikoiakaalala. The first child of Koukou was Iole, a daughter; then followed Opeapea, another daughter. These two were brought up by their parents until they were of age, when they moved to Oahu and married husbands who were connected to certain high chiefs and who were large land owners, during the reign of Kaulamawaho and Kekakapuomaluihi. As Iole and Opeapea had left Kauai for Oahu before the birth of Pikoiakaalala, therefore, they were not present at the birth of their young brother. After they had left, Koukou, their mother, conceived and gave birth to Pikoiakaalala, a son, to whom great care was exercised in his bringing up. In the course of time the child grew to be fine looking but with hair that resembled rat’s hair."
"I loko o ia wa he mea mau i na kanaka a me na keiki ka akoakoa ma kahi hookahi o Wailua e lealea, e makaikai no na mea e hana ia ana. Ia lakou e uwa ana me ka hookanikani pihe no ka olioli, komo aku la keia leo ma na pepeiao o Pikoiakaalala, alaila, ninau oia i ko lakou makuakaue ia Alala: “E, Alala, heaha keia leo e uwa nei o kai o Wailua nei?” “He olohu,” wahi a Alala. “Pehea ia mea?” wahi a Pikoiakaalala. “Penei: olohu iho la na mea elua a oi ka olohu a kekahi, uwa aela, kani ka pihe, oia kela leo au e lohe la.” I aku o Pikoiakaalala: “E iho au e nana ia mea?” “Aole oe e iho e nana,” wahi a Alala, a hala keia la.

Ninau hou ia ia Alala, o ka lua ia: “Heaha keia uwa hou o kai?” “He pahee; pahee iho la a holo loa aku la ka pahee a kekahi uwa ae la.” “E iho au,” pela aku o Pikoiakaalala. Hoole mai o Alala: “Aole oe e iho.”","At about this time it was customary for the people to gather at Wailua to join in and to witness the different athletic sports. One day while the different games were going on, the shouts and yells to encourage the different contestants were heard by Pikoiakaalala. He therefore asked his father Alala: “Say, Alala, what is the cause of that shouting down at Wailua?” “They are playing olohu,” answered Alala. “What is that?” asked Pikoiakaalala. “It is played in this way: there are two contestants playing; when one has rolled his stone disk farther than the other’s, the multitude would shout. That is the noise you hear.” Pikoiakaalala then asked: “Let me go and witness the games?” “You cannot go and see them until after today,” said Alala. After this the multitude shouted again. When Pikoiakaalala heard the commotion, he again asked Alala, this being the second time: “What is that renewed shouting down there?” “They are playing at a game called pahee. When the stick thrown by one contestant slides farther than the one thrown by the other the people would yell.” “I must go down,” said Pikoiakaalala. Alala refused, saying: “You cannot go.”"
"Uwa hou ka pihe o kai, o ke kolu ia, ninau hou ia Alala: “Heaha keia leo hou e uwa nei?” Hai mai o Alala: “He koieie i ka haki wai ana, penei ke ano: he wahi papa pokole i hana ia a maikai, lawe a kahi o ka wai-kahe e ili ana mehe ale la o ka [ ] moana ke opu ae a haki aku, ilaila e lana malie ai me ke kauaheahe. A o ka mea e lana ana peia me ka lilo ole i ka wai, oia kela pihe e uwa maila.” “E iho au?” pela aku o Pikoiakaalala ia Alala. “Ae.”","Again there was yelling at the place, this being the third time. Pikoiakaalala again asked: “What is that fresh shouting that is going on?” Alala replied: “They are playing koieie, at a place in the river near the rapids. The game is played in this [ ] way: it is a short piece of smoothed board which is thrown in the river at a place just near the rapids in such a way that it would float steadily in one place without being carried down the rapids. The one whose piece of board floats the steadiest and is not carried down the rapids wins. The shouting which you have just heard is for the winner.” “May I go down?” asked Pikoiakaalala. “You may,” said Alala."
"Hana iho la o Alala i koieie na Pikoiakaalala a hookuu aku la e iho i kai o Wailua, i kahi o na kanaka e piha ana. A hiki o Pikoiakaalala me kana koieie, nana mai la na mea a pau ia ia nei me ka haohao.

Me ke awa o Kou nei kona pae ana a noho iho la ma ka ae one, he olulo ke ano, no ka mea ua pololi i ka make a ka ai a me ka ia.","Alala then proceeded to make a koieie for Pikoiakaalala, and after it was finished, the boy started down for Wailua where the people were gathered at the games. On the arrival of Pikoiakaalala with his koieie the people all looked at him in surprise. Not very long afterwards the people began throwing their koieie boards into the Wailua River; so Pikoiakaalala threw his into the river also. When the people saw how his koieie floated the steadiest, some of the boys got jealous of him and one of them reached down for Pikoiakaalala’s koieie and threw it into the rapids which carried it into the sea. As soon as his koieie was thrown into the rapids, Pikoiakaalala jumped in after it and he too was carried into the sea by the force of the current for two days and two nights when he landed on Oahu at the harbor of Kou (Honolulu), where he sat on the sand like a castaway, weak from want of food."
"E noho ana laua me ka laua mau kane koikoi ai ahupuaa, aia malalo o laua, he kanaka malama waiwai, o Kauakahi ka inoa. Hele aku la o Kauakahi ma kahi a Pikoiakaalala e moe ana, ninau iho la: “Mahea mai oe?” “Ma ke kai mai nei,” pela aku o Pikoiakaalala. “E hoi kaua i ka hale,” pela aku o Kauakahi.","The two [sisters] were at this time living with their husbands who were men of note, being large land owners, and who had under them a man by the name of Kauakahi as their chief steward. When Kauakahi saw Pikoiakaalala lying there he came up to him and asked: “Where are you from?” “From the sea,” answered Pikoiakaalala. “Come to the house with me,” said Kauakahi."
"A hiki laua i ka hale, olelo aku la o Kauakahi ia Iole a me Opeapea, na kaikuahine o Pikoiakaalala: “He keiki ka’u eia la, loaa aku nei ia’u e moe ana ma ka ae one; nolaila lawe mai nei au i ka hale nei e noho ai me a’u.” Ninau aku la o Iole me Opeapea ia Pikoiakaalala: “Mahea mai oe?

Lele aku la laua uwe, a hai aku la i ka pili ana ia Pikoiakaalala.","Upon their arrival at the house, Kauakahi spoke to Iole and Opeapea, the sisters of Pikoiakaalala: “I have a boy, here he is. I found him asleep on the sand and brought him to the house to live with me.” Iole and Opeapea then asked Pikoiakaalala: “Where are you from? Where were you born and who are your parents?” Pikoiakaalala answered: “Wailua in Kauai is my birthplace. Alala is my father and Koukou is my mother.” When Iole and Opeapea heard these answers given by Pikoiakaalala they knew that he must be their brother, as the names of their parents were correctly given; they therefore sprang on him crying, and at the same time informed Pikoiakaalala of their relationship."
"O ka laua mau kane aia i ka mahiai me na kanaka, hoouna aku la laua ia Kauakahi e kii, me ka olelo aku ua hiki mai ko laua kaikoeke. A hiki o Kauakahi, olelo aku la: “I kauoha mai nei na ’lii wahine ia olua e hoi olua i ka hale, ua puka mai ko olua kaikoeke mai Kauai mai, e kalua puaa a me ka ai.” Ia wa, makaukau na mea a pau a hiki i ka hale, kalua ka puaa me ka ai. Kaha hele aku la o Pikoiakaalala, a puka aku la i kahi o na ’lii o Oahu nei e noho ana, a hiki ia, e pili ana na ’lii i ka pana iole.","The husbands of the sisters of Pikoiakaalala were out in the fields working with the men, so Kauakahi was sent to bring them home and to tell them that their brother-in-law had arrived. When Kauakahi came up to them he said: “You have been sent for by your two wives to return home because your brother-in-law has arrived from Kauai, and to kill a pig and prepare some food.” The food and pig were gotten ready and as soon as they arrived at home they were cooked in the ground."
"Na ’lii. O Kaulamawaho ke kane, o Kekakapuomaluihi ka wahine, e pili ana laua i na waiwai. O Mainele ka ke kane pana iole, a o ka wahine alii aole ana pana [ ] iole; nolaila, olelo hooioi o Pikoiakaalala imua o Mainele, penei: “He mea liilii wale no ia mea, aole ia he mea nalowale.” Lohe ke ’lii wahine i keia olelo a Pikoiakaalala, kahea mai e hele aku a kokoke, a hiki ia, ninau mai ke ’lii wahine: “He ike no oe?” “Ae,” pela aku o Pikoiakaalala.

When he arrived he found them betting on rat shooting. Kaulamawaho the king and Kekakapuomaluihi [ ] the queen were betting their possessions. Mainele was the king’s rat shooter, but the queen had no one to do the shooting for her; so when Pikoiakaalala saw this he boasted in the presence of Mainele in the following manner: “That is simple enough, anybody can do that.” When the queen heard this she called for Pikoiakaalala to come near to her. As he stood in the presence of the queen she asked him: “Do you know how?” Pikoiakaalala answered: “Yes.” “If you know how to shoot rats,” said the queen, “then I will stake my property on your skill and you can compete with Mainele.” As soon as they agreed on the conditions the bet was made."
"No Mainele. He kanaka kaukau alii o Mainele, a he kanaka akamai loa ma ka pana iole, nana wale no ke eo ke pili, he umi iole e ku i ka pua hookahi, i ka pana hookahi ana. No ka pili ana.

Ma keia wahi e ike ia ai, he ano kino iole na makua a me na kaikuahine.","Mainele was a high chief and was an expert in the art of rat shooting; he was known to win all the contests in which he took part. He could hit ten rats with one arrow at one shot. In regard to the wager: the king staked his property on Mainele, while the queen staked her property on Pikoiakaalala. The condition was that whoever could shoot and hit ten rats with one arrow would win, the one failing to do this would lose. Mainele took the first shot, and when the people looked they saw that the arrow had entered into ten rats, so they shouted, “Mainele has won! Mainele has won!” Pikoiakaalala then sarcastically remarked to Mainele: “How awkward! It is easy enough to hit the rat in the body because the object is large. I thought you were going to shoot at the whiskers in order to prove your great skill, but I see I am mistaken.” Mainele answered: “You are a deceitful boy. From the day I first began shooting rats until this day, I have never seen a man who could shoot at the rats’ whiskers.” Because the two were arguing over the matter so long, bets were again made about hitting the rats’ whiskers. After the new bets were made, Pikoiakaalala took his shot. At this time there were no rats to be seen, the brush in the near neighborhood was without rats; so Pikoiakaalala prayed his Kalokalo prayer. By this we can see that his parents and sisters must have had the forms of rats."

Mainele, Pikoiakaalala’s opponent, then said, together with the people who were present: “It is a draw! It is a draw, because you have hit ten rats and one bat with your [ ] arrow, and Mainele has hit ten rats with his arrow. The bat should not be counted as it is not a rat.” Pikoiakaalala replied: “That bat should be counted as a rat, as I have hit it with my arrow, and according to the old saying, which is as follows:"

So Mainele and the king, Kaulamawaho, were beaten. Therefore we can see plainly that the sisters of Pikoiakaalala, Iole and Opeapea, were rats."

This call for a universal gathering was made in order to find Pikoiakaalala. When the people were gathered Pikoiakaalala was not recognized as he stood among them as he had grown larger after partaking of that one meal; for at the time he had his contest with Mainele he was but a mere boy. He was, however, later on recognized by means of his great skill at shooting rats."
Iloko o ke anaina kanaka e noho ana he luahine haumakaiole ua hele a liilii na maka a like me ko ka iole. Kahea o Pikoiakaalala: “Ka iole nui e! Ka iole nui e! Makau ole i ke kanaka keia iole.

When Pikoiakaalala saw her, he shouted out: “See that big rat! What a large rat!! It is not afraid of the people. My arrow will hit you! My arrow will hit you!”"
"I keia kahea ana a Pikoiakaalala, lohe o Mainele a me na ’lii; i aku o Mainele: “Kanaka hoopunipuni oe; aia i hea ia iole holo mai i loko o keia anaina kanaka nui?

A rat!” continued Pikoiakaalala. Mainele replied: “Let us make a wager.” In this new wager the king and queen again took part; the king backed up Mainele while the queen supported Pikoiakaalala. As soon as the wager was decided on, Pikoiakaalala made ready to shoot. Before his arrow left the bow, however, Mainele remarked: “If the actual rat is hit then the wager is won and Pikoiakaalala can [ ] have the stakes.” He said this because they all felt sure that no rat would be seen in the crowd of people."
"Pana o Pikoiakaalala i ka pua, ku ka luahine haumakaiole. Hoole o Mainele a me na kanaka a pau aohe ia he iole, he kanaka ia.

Aole ia he iole? He iole ia.” Eo o Mainele.","When Pikoiakaalala let fly his arrow, it hit the old woman whose eyes were dim and had grown small because of her great age. At seeing this Mainele and the people refused to give up the stakes as the old woman was not a rat, but a human being. Pikoiakaalala answered that the object hit by his arrow was a rat, saying: “When a baby is born it is called a child; when it grows bigger it is called a youth; when it stops growing it is called a full-grown man; when he walks with a cane he is called an old man; and when his eyes grow small he is likened to a rat ‘ haumaka-iole ,’ a rat. Is not that a rat? It is a rat.” Mainele was therefore beaten."

Look at that big rat sitting there!!” At this Mainele remarked: “You are a deceiving man. Where is the rat to come from that you could see there? You are the greatest liar I have ever seen. You have no equal.” Pikoiakaalala said: “There is a rat. If I should shoot and hit a rat, what would you do?” “All right, we will make a bet, if you shoot and hit a rat I lose and if you don’t hit one you lose,” said Mainele. The bets were then made, the king and queen doing the betting, consisting of articles of value and land. After the bets were made, Pikoiakaalala let fly his arrow which flew and hit the top-most batten Kuaiole. At this Mainele looked on and said: “That is not a rat, that is a batten, you have not beaten me.” Pikoiakaalala replied: “That is a rat, for the common expression is this: ‘Put on and bind down the rat-backed batten.’ Is not that expression connection with the word rat? I say it is; therefore, I have won.” At this everybody present decided that Mainele was beaten. When Mainele was beaten this time, his skill and fame began to wane, while the skill and fame of Pikoiakaalala as a shooter of rats was established."
"Maanei, e nana kakou no ke ’lii nui o Hawaii no Keawenuiaumi.

While Keawenuiaumi was on his way with his canoe makers to the forest of Hilo one day, for the purpose of cutting down a large koa tree for a canoe, two birds flew on to the very top of the tree and called out in a loud voice: “Say, Keawenuiaumi, you cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe; a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”"
"A lohe o Keawenuiaumi i keia leo o na manu, haalele i ke oki ana i ke koa, no ke kahea mau o na manu pea i na la a pau loa; nolaila, uluhua o Keawenuiaumi, a manao iho la oia e imi i kanaka akamai i ka pana pua i make na manu.

As the birds kept up this calling continually Keawenuiaumi became vexed and thereupon made up his mind to go in search of a skillful archer to come and kill the birds. About this time the fame of Mainele as an archer reached Hawaii, so Keawenuiaumi made a vow, “That if Mainele would kill the birds he should receive the king’s daughter in marriage together with a portion of the island of Hawaii.” Upon the arrival of Keawenuiaumi’s messengers in Oahu, Mainele was informed of the wish of the king. As soon as Mainele heard that he was wanted on Hawaii, he immediately prepared his double canoe and got together his men who were to accompany him. [ ]"
"O Kauakahi, ke kanaka nana i lawe o Pikoiakaalala, ia ia e moe ana ma ka ae one mahope o kona pae ana mai Kauai mai, olelo aku la ia ia Pikoiakaalala: “E holo ana o Mainele i Hawaii e pana ai i na manu, ua hiki mai nei na elele a Keawenuiaumi.” “Ae, ina oe e manao e holo au, e pii oe i ie, a ulana hokeo, i wahi no’u e noho ai, i ole au e ike ia e Mainele, a e olelo no hoi oe, he hokeo akua nou. Pela au e hiki ai.” Hana iho la o Kauakahi e like me na olelo a Pikoiakaalala, a makaukau ka hinai ie, a me ka holo o Mainele.","When Kauakahi, the man who found Pikoiakaalala sleeping on the sand, heard of the contemplated trip to be made by Mainele to Hawaii, he went to Pikoiakaalala and told him of what he had heard, saying: “Mainele is going to Hawaii to shoot birds for Keawenuiaumi; the messengers have just arrived from Hawaii.” Pikoiakaalala answered: “If you wish me to go along you had better go up and get some ie vines and make a basket in the shape of a calabash for me to hide in, so that I may not be seen by Mainele, and you can say that it is a basket for the safe keeping of your god. This will be the means of getting me to Hawaii.” Kauakahi then followed out the instructions given by Pikoiakaalala and had the basket made, and the trip with Mainele arranged."
"I aku o Mainele ia Kauakahi: “E holo kaua i Hawaii.” Ae mai o Kauakahi: “Ae, he ae no ko’u i ka holo me oe i Hawaii, aia nae a ae oe i ka’u olelo.” “Heaha ia ia olelo?” wahi a Mainele. “He hokeo akua no’u, he kapu kona waa e kau ai, aohe kanaka e kau ma kona waa, owau wale no.” Ua pono ia olelo ia Mainele. I ka la o lakou i holo ai i Hawaii, kau aku la o Mainele ma kona mau kaulua, me na ohua a me na hoewaa; o Kauakahi me Pikoiakaalala i loko o ka hokeo ie ma ko laua waa, mahope ka hokeo, mamua o Kauakahi.","When Mainele’s preparations were finally completed, he approached Kauakahi and said: “Let us sail to Hawaii.” Kauakahi replied: “All right, I am willing to go to Hawaii with you providing you give me your consent to do what I want.” “What is it you want?” asked Mainele. “I have a basket where my god is kept. The canoe in which this god is to be taken, as I want to take it along, must be tabued and no one must be allowed to take passage in it outside of myself.” This was satisfactory to Mainele. On the day agreed on for the voyage to start for Hawaii, Mainele, his followers and paddlers boarded their double canoe, while Kuakahi and Pikoiakaalala, who was in the basket, boarded their canoe, the basket in the after part and Kuakahi in the fore part of the canoe."
"Olelo hoakaka no ka hokeo ie. No ka hakahaka o ka ulana ana, komo ka makani i loko, aole e pau ke aho, nolaila i komo ai o Pikoiakaalala i loko e noho ai. A hala o Oahu nei mahope o lakou, hoalulu na waa o lakou mawaho o ka pali o Kaholo, i Lanai, a ahiahi, hina ke kehau o Kahalapalaoa mahope o na waa, holo aku la lakou mai ia ahiahi a owakawaka kai ao o ke kakahiaka nui, nana aku la lakou i ka wailele o Kawaikapu i na pali hulaana, e kupono ana i Makaukiu ma Kohala i Hawaii. Aia hoi, he hulaana, o Kuukuunaakaiole ka inoa e hamama mai ana kona waha i kahi a na waa e holo aku nei. I aku o Pikoiakaalala ia Kauakahi: “E olelo aku oe ia Mainele e pana aku i ka waha o ka iole e pouliuli mai nei.” A lohe o Mainele i ka olelo a Kauakahi, hoole maila: “Aohe iole, he pali ia; he kanaka lalau oe.”","A few words of explanation relating to the basket. This was made with several openings which allowed a free current of air and enabled Pikoiakaalala to sit therein. After leaving Oahu to their rear, the canoes after a quick passage, were laid to off the cliffs of Kaholo, at Lanai, on the afternoon of that same day. In the evening the breeze from Kahalepalaoa which came directly from behind them sent their canoes flying along at such a rate of speed that by dawn of the next morning they were able to make out the waterfall of Kawaikapu on the steep cliffs of Makaukiu, Kohala, Hawaii. At this place is a sort of a bay surrounded by high cliffs which opens directly to the sea and which was right ahead of the canoes as they were approaching land; the name of the place is Kuukuunaakaiole. Pikoiakaalala upon seeing where they were said to Kauakahi: “Tell Mainele to shoot at the mouth of the rat which is dimly seen ahead of us.” When Mainele heard this he replied to Kauakahi: “That is not a rat, that is a cliff, you are mistaken.”"
"A haalele lakou i na pali hulaana, po a ao hiki lakou ma Hilo a pae ma ke awa o Kaipalao; pii na mea a pau a hiki i kahi o Keawenuiaumi, koe o Kauakahi me ka hokeo ie ana. I aku o Mainele: “E pii kaua.” Olelo mai o Kauakahi: “Aole au e pii a hiki kuu hokeo akua. Ia lohe ana o Mainele, kauoha aku la o Mainele ia Keawenuiaumi i kanaka no ka hokeo akua e hiki ai i uka. Kena mai la o Keawenuiaumi eha kanaka, amo aku la i ka hokeo ie a hiki i ka hale, olelo aku o Kauakahi ia Mainele: “Aole kakou e pono ke noho ma ka hale hookahi me ke ’kua o kaua, e aho e olelo oe ia Keawenuiaumi i wahi hale no maua.” Olelo aku la o Mainele ia Keawenuiaumi, i [ ] hale no ke akua o laua me Kauakahi; mahope oia lohe ana, aohe i upuupu iho paa ka hale, haawale o Kauakahi me ka hokeo ie. O keia mau hana a pau loa, na Pikoiakaalala wale no, i ole oia e ike ia e Mainele a me na kanaka.","Upon passing the cliffs they continued on their way to Hilo, at which place they arrived the next day and landed at Kaipalaoa. Everybody upon landing proceeded to the place where Keawenuiaumi was at that time residing with the exception of Kauakahi and his basket. When Mainele saw that Kauakahi was left behind he asked him: “Let us go on up?” Kauakahi replied: “I will not go on up unless the basket which my god is in goes with me.” When Mainele heard this, he requested of Keawenuiaumi that men be furnished to carry the basket along up to the house, whereupon Keawenuiaumi ordered four men to pack the basket to the house. Upon their arrival at the house, Kauakahi spoke to Mainele: “I don’t think it right for us to live in the same house with our god; it is best that you ask Keawenuiaumi that a small house be given me where I can live with the god.” Mainele therefore requested of Keawenuiaumi for [ ] a house for the god and Kauakahi. As soon as the king heard this, orders were given that a small house be built, which was finished in no time, where Kauakahi moved in with his basket. This request was really made at the wish of Pikoiakaalala, in order that he might not be seen by Mainele and the people."
"Lohe na mea a pau loa, pana o Mainele i ka pua, aohe launa ae i na manu. Hana ke olokea he alanui e pii ae ai a waena o ke koa pana ae, aohe no he launa ae i na manu. Hawanawana aku o Pikoiakaalala ia Kauakahi: “E ninau alu oe ia Mainele a me Keawenuiaumi heaha keia ku ole o na manu? He pana ole ia paha i ka pua, ina paha e pana ia ku na manu.” A lohe o Mainele i keia olelo a Kauakahi, i mai la: “Aole no la hoi e pana ae; aia no hoi ka manu ke kau mai la, eia ka pua, pana ae no hoi paha, malama o ku ia oe.” I aku o Kauakahi: “Ae, e olelo ae au i kuu akua a nana e pana na manu.” Ia wa ku ana o Pikoiakaalala mai loko ae o ka hokeo ie me kana pua pana iole. Alaila, ike o Mainele a me na kanaka o Oahu aku nei he kanaka ko loko o ka hokeo ie.

Ia pana ana, ku na manu a elua, pahu ana i lalo, uwa ka aha kanaka i ke akamai o Pikoiakaalala.","As soon as the people heard the call, Mainele shot at the birds, but his arrow did not come anywhere near them on account of the height of the tree. A staging was then built up which reached about half way up the tree, but even then Mainele’s arrow did not reach the birds. Pikoiakaalala then whispered to Kauakahi: “Ask Mainele and Keawenuiaumi why the birds are not hit. Perhaps Mainele was not shooting at them, if he did he would hit them.” When Mainele heard the remarks of Kauakahi, he replied: “Why don’t you shoot at them yourself? There are the birds, here is the bow and here are the arrows, go ahead and shoot, may be you will hit them.” At this Kauakahi replied: “All right, I will ask my god to shoot the birds.” Pikoiakaalala then came out of the basket with his rat shooting arrows to the surprise of Mainele and the Oahu people that accompanied him, for they had not known that a man had been in this basket all this time. Upon coming up to Keawenuiaumi, Pikoiakaalala requested that a basin of water be brought and made to stand under the tree. As soon as this was done Pikoiakaalala came and stood over the basin; while he looked into the basin at the reflection of the birds in the water, he held his arms above his head with his bow bent and his arrow aimed at the birds; as soon as he saw that the birds were in line he let fly his arrow which flew true to the mark hitting both birds and they came tumbling down to the ground. The people upon seeing this great skill shown by Pikoiakaalala gave a mighty shout."
"Lilo ke kaikamahine a Keawenuiaumi ia Pikoiakaalala a me kekahi aoao o Hawaii waiwai o Kauakahi, hilahila o Mainele a hoi mai i Oahu nei. [ ]","Keawenuiaumi, true to his word gave his daughter to Pikoiakaalala to wife and also gave him a portion of Hawaii, which made Kauakahi a very rich man. Mainele was so ashamed that he immediately returned to Oahu. [ ]"
"Oka aina i noho ai o Kalelealuaka a me Keinohoomanawanui, o Lihue e waiho ana malalo hikina o ka mauna o Kaala i Oahu. O ke kahua hale nae, o Oahunui.

The ground upon which the house stood is “Oahunui”. At this time Kakuhihewa was the king of Ewa and of the districts adjoining; while Pueonui was the king of the district of Kona, embracing that stretch of country from Moanalua to Makapuu. At this time these two kings were contending in war with each other whereby Pueonui was acquiring the Ewa lands. Kalelealuaka was a very brave and fearless man in battle and in fighting. Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui often spent their time wishing for certain things. The house in which they lived faced directly towards Ewa."
"He kanaka koa loa o Kalelealuaka ma ke kaua a me ka hakaka. O ka laua hana me Keinohoomanawanui, o ke kuko. O ko laua hale, ua kupono ka puka i kai o Ewa, o ko laua manawa e kuko ai, o ka wa pau o ka paina ana o ke ahiahi e pupuhi ana kukui, aia a hoi e moe, kau ke poo i ka uluna, huli ke alo iluna nana i kaupoku o ka hale.

That is my wish, I want you to know.”"
"I aku o Kalelealuaka: “Aole kau he kuko; o ka’u no ke kuko.” “Pehea kau kuko?” wahi a Keinohoomanawanui. “O na ilio nahu maka o Kakuhihewa na kaua e ai; ka puaa kea o ka niho, na kaua e kalua; ke awa nui o na loko na kaua e ai, na puawa ona na kaua e inu.

Helelei, he keu mawaho o ka umi; oia ke ano ma ka olelo kahiko o Hawaii nei. Eia ke ano o keia mau inoa.","Kalelealuaka would then reply: “That is no wish, I have the proper wish.” “What is your wish?” Keinohoomanawanui would ask. “That we may eat the dogs of Kakuhihewa that bite the face of people; that we may bake the hog whose tusks are crossed; that we may eat the fat awa of the fish ponds; that we may drink of the best and most intoxicating awa; that Kakuhihewa himself shall chew the awa, strain it into the containers, pour it out into the cups, place the cups to our lips; and after we have slept off the effects of the awa, that he bring his daughters and make them our wives. That is my wish, I want you to know.” Keinohoomanawanui then replied: “Say, we will get killed. I thought we were to wish on other subjects; but I see your wish is in relation to the king. If that is your wish we will surely get killed.” This was carried on by these two for ten nights and over."
"No keia a mau o ke kukui i na po a pau, uluhua o Kakuhihewa, kena i ke kiu e pii e nana i keia kukui a o ke aumoe.

As the [ ] spy arrived and stood on the outside of the house he heard Keinohoomanawanui name his wish, which was followed by Kalelealuaka, after this the two became quiet. The spy then stuck a short wooden dagger in the ground at the entrance of the house and returned to the king. At his arrival the king asked: “What was that lamp burning for that you went up to see?” The spy then repeated all he had heard. While the spy was repeating what he had heard to the king, a priest was at this time with the king. At the conclusion of the recital, the king turned to the priest and asked him: “What about that man Kalelealuaka? Do you think his wish proper or not?” The priest replied: “What he has said should be carried out, because he will be the man to gain the conquest for you, so that you will own the whole island. You must, however, carry out every detail of his wish with your own hands.” On the advice of the priest, Kakuhihewa proceeded to carry out in detail the wish made by Kalelealuaka. The priest had, however, instructed the king to build two houses, one to serve as an eating house and the other a sleeping house; both to be built and completed in one day and then Kalelealuaka was to be sent for and brought down."
"Ia laua e kamailio ana no ka pahoa i kukulu ia ma ka puka o ka hale, nana aku la laua i ka moe mai o ke kaoo huakai kanaka, mai kahi o ke ’lii a kokoke i ko laua nei wahi, me na koi lipi mai mua a hope o ka huakai. “Aia hoi paha ka make o kaua la,” pela aku o Keinohoomanawanui ia Kalelealuaka; makau wale. O keia huakai, he poe ooki laau hale, e like me na olelo a ke kahuna i ke ’lii, hookahi la ua paa na hale elua.","While they were discussing the dagger found at their door, they looked down toward Ewa and saw a company of people coming up toward them from the king’s house all armed with stone axes from front to rear of the procession. At the sight of the people Keinohoomanawanui remarked: “There perhaps is our death coming?” Kalelealuaka replied: “You coward.” The company they saw coming was on their way to cut timber for the erection of the two houses as advised by the priest. These houses were completed in one day."
"NO KE KII ANA IA KALELEALUAKA A ME KEINOHOOMANAWANUI, E LAWE I KAI O EWA IMUA O KE ’LII O KAKUHIHEWA.",HOW KALELEALUAKA AND KEINOHOOMANAWANUI WERE SENT FOR AND HOW THEY WERE TAKEN TO KING KAKUHIHEWA AT EWA.
"Ia po a ao ae, nana hou aku la o Keinohoomanawanui i nei huakai nui e pii mai ana mai kai mai o Ewa, me na pololu, me ka ihe me ke kuia, me ka elau, me na mahiole, me ka ahuula, me ka manele auamo.

Eia hoi ka manele la kau mai iluna.”","On the following day Keinohoomanawanui again saw a large company of people coming up from Ewa, all armed with spears and other instruments of war; some had war helmets and feather capes while some had a litter for carrying people. Upon seeing the people Keinohoomanawanui turned to Kalelealuaka and said: “Our death is now close upon us.” Kalelealuaka replied: “Keep your eye on them.” Kalelealuaka all this time was lying down with his war club, showing no fear and acting as though willing to fight. When the people arrived outside of the house, six of them surrounded the house all armed with death weapons. Soon after this Kalelealuaka got up, stepped [ ] outside with his war club in hand, raised it and struck it on the house cutting it in two and scattering the grass and timbers in all directions. The officer in command of the soldiers spoke up saying: “We did not come here to inflict death, but we have been sent to bring you to Ewa by the orders of Kakuhihewa, the king. Here is the litter, get in.”"
"A hiki lakou nei i kai o Ewa, ua hoomakaukau ponoi o Kakuhihewa ke ’lii i na mea a pau, e like me ka olelo a ke kahuna i olelo mua ia ma ka hoomaka ana o keia kaao.

Lilo ae la o Kalelealuaka i hunona na ke ’lii a me Keinohoomanawanui, hookahi hana a Kalelealuaka he hiamoe i loko o ka hale me ka wahine, ke kaikamahine a Kakuhihewa.","Before their arrival at Ewa, Kakuhihewa had in the meantime prepared with his own hands everything as advised by the priest, as already set forth in this story. The reason why Kakuhihewa had followed the instructions was because he wanted to gain possession of all of Pueonui’s lands, and also because the priest had advised him so. Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui were from this time on taken as the king’s sons-in-law. All Kalelealuaka did after this was to retire with the daughter of Kakuhihewa in one of the houses prepared for them."
"I loko o keia wa a lakou e noho nei, hoomaka ke kaua o na ’lii, o Kakuhihewa a me Pueonui. O Keinohoomanawanui lilo ae la ia i luna koa, oia kekahi i hele i ke kaua, ua lanakila ko lakou aoao ma ke kaua ana me Pueonui.

Keinohoomanawanui was at once made one of the king’s officers and he went out to take part in one of the battles, and in which Pueonui was beaten. Kakuhihewa and his men went out to fight during the daytime and they slew a great many of Pueonui’s men. Keinohoomanawanui always gained the victory in these battles so that in time the king began to give Keinohoomanawanui the credit of such splendid results."
"No Kalelealuaka. I ke ao, moe oia a kani ka moa kuakahi o ka wanaao, hele e pepehi i na ’lii koa o Pueonui.

He would run from Ewa to Kapukaki, the heights looking down at Halawa, where he would meet the officers of the opposing army and fight them single handed, striking on the right and then on the left. After slaying the enemy by the use of his war club he would carry off their war helmets and feather capes. This was carried on by him for several nights without the knowledge of anyone. One night as he was returning a farmer at Halawa saw him. Kalelealuaka had slain several of Pueonui’s men, and secured some feather capes and war helmets and was on his way home; but he was traveling at such speed that the farmer was unable to make out who he was. On the night following the farmer thought he would lie in wait for this man; sure enough he saw Kalelealuaka going along at a very great rate of speed, so taking up his spear whose point was fixed like a hook, he threw it and hit the man in the arm just above the wrist; the spear point entered and was made fast. Kalelealuaka seizing the spear tried to pull it out, but was unable on account of the peculiar point, so he broke it, leaving the point still in the arm."
"O Pueonui ua pio kona aoao, a ua pau loa kona aina ia Kakuhihewa, ua manao hoi o Kakuhihewa na Keinohoomanawanui keia pio o Pueonui, a me keia make o na kanaka. No ke kanaka mahiai.

Kakuhihewa all this time thought Keinohoomanawanui was the cause of these victories over Pueonui and the slaughter of the men. In the meantime the farmer refused to give Keinohoomanawanui the credit of these victories and declared that the final defeat and death of Pueonui was the work of a different man altogether, who went out to fight only in the early morning. He described this unknown man as a very fast runner of whom he knew no equal; the man always carried a war club, and on his return would come with war helmets and feather capes. “I have wounded him in the arm and I think [ ] the spear point is still in his arm. It will be the means by which the man could be recognized.”"
"A lohe o Kakuhihewa i keia mau olelo kukala aku la ia i kana olelo kuahaua: “Aohe kanaka noho, aohe wahine, aohe keiki.

[ ]","When Kakuhihewa heard this, he issued a call for everybody to come together, no man, woman or child to remain at home, excepting those who when they fell down were unable to get up again, and those who were so sick that they could not walk. After everybody had come together, the farmer proceeded to look for his man by looking at their arms; but he was unable to locate him. He then asked Kakuhihewa: “Is there no one left?” “None,” said the king, “except my son-in-law who is asleep at home, and has done nothing requiring him.” “Send for him and let me see [his arm],” said the farmer. When Kalelealuaka came up to the farmer and held up his arm the point of the spear was found. The farmer then remarked: “Surely, this is the man that slew all of Pueonui’s men, and this is the very man whom I saw coming in the early morning while I was on my way to work and at whom I threw the spear, the point of which is still in his arm. I also saw him returning with war helmets and feather capes, and I am certain his house must be filled with those articles; let someone be sent to fetch them.” When the man that was sent returned, he brought with him several war helmets and feather capes which made a huge pile, proving that it was Kalelealuaka that caused the overthrow and final defeat of Pueonui. So Kalelealuaka was made chief ruler, while Kakuhihewa served under him. [ ]"
"O Pukoula e pili la me ka waiahao kahi noho o Pumaia, ma Kona, Oahu. O kana hana he hanai puaa ma kana wahine. Aia ia laua he umi pa puaa, a hookahi puaa punahele loa ia Pumaia, he puaa anana, he puaa lilo ole ia hai, he puaa hanai a make pu me Pumaia.","On the land of Pukoula which adjoins Waiahao in the district of Kona, Oahu, was the home of Pumaia. His chief occupation with that of his wife, was hog raising. They at one time had as many as ten hog pens; but amongst his whole herd [of hogs] there was one he thought a good deal more of than all the others; one that measured over a fathom in length which he had vowed he would never part from. This hog was to be kept until the death of Pumaia when it was to be killed."

A makaukau lakou e hele mai e kau me Pumaia.","Kualii who was king at this time, was building the temple called Kapua, which was situated to the east of Leahi Hill overlooking Mamala. At the completion of the temple, Kualii ordered that a hog be brought from Pumaia. Upon the arrival of the messengers, Pumaia asked them: “What is the object of your call?” “We have been sent by Kualii to you for a hog for the temple. You give us one.” “Yes, you can have one,” said Pumaia. “There is the pig pen.” This request was kept up until all the ten hog pens were exhausted and there remained but the one hog he thought so much of. After a time Kualii sent his men for another hog. Upon their arrival in the presence of Pumaia, they were asked: “What has brought you here?” “We have been sent by Kualii to come for the hog that is left.” “You shall not have it. He is only seeking trouble. I thought he was really in need of swine, but no.” The men then grabbed the hog and fought with Pumaia for its possession, many against one. In this fight [ ] sometimes Pumaia would get possession of the pig and again the others would get it. This was kept up for some time when at last a regular fight was had. Pumaia then struck out one blow on the right and one on the left with his fists, killing all the men except one, who ran to the king, Kualii, and reported to him, saying: “We have all been killed by Pumaia and I alone am left to bring the tidings to you.” Kualii then ordered his soldiers and officers to arm themselves with their spears and other implements of war and to dress in their war helmets and feather capes and when ready to go and make war on Pumaia."
"Haalele iho la keia ia Pukoula, nee aku la ia a Kewalo, o kahi ia i hoouka ai me Pumaia, malaila i luku ia ai na koa, a me na ’lii o Kualii a pau loa i ka make ia Pumaia.

Ma keia hoomainoino ana ia Pumaia, ua wali ka iwi auwae, a ua weluwelu no hoi.","After this fight Pumaia left Pukoula and moved on to Kewalo where he was met by the soldiers and a regular battle was fought in which Pumaia slew all of Kualii’s warriors and officers. One of the men, however, managed to escape and carried the result to Kualii. When Kualii heard that his warriors and officers had all been killed, he called all his chiefs and warriors to come together, with his god, Kanemuka. Pumaia in the meantime had moved on to Pawaa, where he was met by Kualii and his men, and another battle was fought in which Pumaia again slew all the chiefs and warriors, with the exception of Kualii and his god. When Kualii saw that his men and chiefs were all slain he prayed to his god to capture Pumaia, and so through the power of this god Pumaia was caught and bound. Kualii was so incensed at Pumaia that he was immediately killed and was dragged to Kapua where his dead body was thrown into the pit with the men he had killed. In the course of the ill treatment given his body, the jaws were crushed and cut up into fragments."
"No ka wahine a Pumaia. Noho iho la ia me ka laua kaikamahine opiopio i ka hale, e kali ana i ka hoi mai o ke kane, mai ka aui ana o ka la a ke aumoe kupono i ke kau.

At this long absence of Pumaia the mother remarked to the daughter: “Your father perhaps is dead. In all his travels before this he generally returned home before dark.” While the two were talking they heard a shaking noise outside the house and an indistinct call to open the door. The mother then rose and opened the door, and lo it was the spirit of Pumaia. Relating to the spirit of Pumaia: It is told in this legend that the spirit is always much stronger than the living body and that several people have been killed by spirits; the following narrative will show this."

Akahi no au a lohe ua make.” A lohe na elele, maopopo aole i kii ka wahine, hoi aku la lakou.","As the jaw bones of Pumaia were so crushed his words were indistinctly heard, so the spirit had to resort to whispers and gesticulations of the hands, like a deaf and dumb person, in order to be understood. Pumaia then said to his wife: “I struck out right and left and killed them all.” The wife asked: “You killed them all?” “Yes, yes,” at the same time bringing the hands together and making the negative motion to indicate that nothing was left. Pumaia then said to the wife: “Let us go and get my body.” The wife assented and took a piece of kapa cloth in which to wrap the body. The blazing spirit then went ahead, the wife following until they reached Kapua, the temple of Kualii and the pit where the body had been thrown. The spirit of Pumaia then flew and landed right in the center of the pit and flamed; the night guards were fast asleep, as it was then well on towards midnight, the Milky Way being plainly seen. The wife then approached the hole and felt of the dead bodies. The [ ] spirit then whispered and at the same time making motions with the hands to remove the dead bodies and pointed down in the bottom of the hole. The wife followed the instructions until she found the body of Pumaia beneath, all ragged and torn. She then collected the pieces and put them in the kapa cloth, in the form of a bundle, put it on her back and returned home. Upon her arrival at the house Pumaia’s spirit told the wife, at the same time pointing at the floor of the house, to remove the mats, dig a hole and conceal the body, before the arrival of the people who would search for the body the next day. The wife did as she was told. On the next day a searching party arrived looking for the body of Pumaia. The searchers asked Pumaia’s wife: “Did you not go and remove the body of your husband last night?” “I do not know anything about it nor have I removed it. Is Pumaia then dead? This is the first that I have heard of his death.” When the searchers heard this they were certain that the wife could not have removed the body, so they returned [to the king]."

The spirit of Pumaia flew to this cave and lit there flaming. The wife with the bones of Pumaia and the daughter then climbed up the cliff until they arrived at the cave, where they made their dwelling. At the end of the fourth day, the last finger of food for the daughter was eaten up when the mother said: “I am distressed at your fate, the one having bones that need blood. Here we are following after the bones that have no blood, and have left food and meat.” When they woke up the next morning they saw food, meat and other articles such as kapas, skirts and various other things. All these things had been brought by the spirit of Pumaia from Waikiki. In that one night the spirit had traveled over the whole district. This was carried on for several nights and the food and animals, the fish in the ponds and the growing food were brought to the cave. The spirit of Pumaia kept up these raids until at last it began to raid Kualii’s own lands. All the different properties were taken, even the canoes, mats, war helmets, feather capes, calabashes, water gourds and various other things of the house and the land. At night, while the people were asleep, Pumaia’s spirit would enter the house, carry out the sleepers and then empty the house of their valuables. Upon waking up in the morning the people would find themselves out of doors and their houses robbed of all the things of value; even the growing crops in the [ ] field were stolen by Pumaia’s spirit. By these raids the wife and daughter were able to have all they wanted and far more than their needs. One day the wife sighed and said: “Yes, we have all we need, but there is one thing lacking, we have no servant to do our work for us.” When Pumaia’s spirit heard this, it went off and brought back a servant for the wife and daughter."
"No Kualii.

A priest who was living with him at the time then told Kualii who the thief was in the following manner: “This thief is no other person than your enemy Pumaia; his body is dead, but his spirit is at large and is much stronger than when the body was alive. You will soon be killed; if you act rightly you will then be saved.” “What must I do to be saved?” asked Kualii. The priest replied: “You must build three houses; one house for the wife and daughter; one house for the property and servants; and one house for the bones of Pumaia. After the houses are completed go and bring your enemy back and take good care of his bones; he may then take compassion on you and you will then be saved.” Kualii then consented to do all the things advised by the priest."
"Ma keia olelo a ke Kahuna ia Kualii, ua akaka wale no ia ia Pumaia. A makaukau o Kualii i na mea a pau loa, ia wa, pane aku o Pumaia i ka wahine a me ke kaikamahine, e hoi i kai.

[ ]","While this conversation was being carried between the priest and Kualii, Pumaia was amused as he heard the advice of the priest and the consent given by Kualii. He then advised his wife and daughter to return to the shore. The wife in obedience to the instructions made ready for their return. While on their way back to the old home they met Kualii’s men who had been sent to bring them to the king. Upon their arrival at the king’s house, they found everything prepared for their reception and they lived with the king ever after this. [ ]"

The duty of this spirit, Hanaaumoe, was to meet all the canoes that arrived from other lands and through his cunning and flattery urge the people to land. In this way several people were killed and eaten by the spirits. As this spirit had no equal in the art of flattery, he was delegated by Halalii the king of the spirits to guard all the points along the coast of Oahu. While he was on duty one day he saw canoes approaching Oahu from the west. In the double canoe was Kahaookamoku the friend of the king of Kauai, several men and Kaneopa a lame fellow. These people were from Kauai and were on their way to Hawaii to make a visit. Hanaaumoe upon seeing these people invited them to come ashore: “Come ashore, land your canoe. Don’t go to Hawaii for that island is filled with spirits. Hawaii has spirits for Kanikaa lives there. Maui has spirits for Keoloewa lives there. Lanai has spirits for Pahulu lives there. Molokai has spirits for Kaunolu lives there. Here is the island that has no spirits; land the canoe. There is food ashore, there are houses, [ ] there are women for each, the paddlers shall have two apiece, as wives, and your chief Kahaookamoku shall have five wives.”"

Late that evening Hanaaumoe came to the door of the house where the strangers were sleeping, scattered here and there like castaways, being very tired from the effects of the sea trip, and called out:"
"Kahea ana o Hanaaumoe, moe ea? Halahala kau e, Halahala kau e, Ua moe oukou?","Asleep are you? Piled on one another, Scattered here and there, Are you all asleep?"

Upon hearing the call, Kaneopa answered: “We are not asleep, we are still awake waiting for the food, and meat and our wives.” Hanaaumoe then resorted to falsehood: “The things cannot arrive in a hurry as the road from Nuuanu down is long, the climb from Kapukaki is long and the plain Kulaokahua is also afar off.” Hanaaumoe soon after this returned to Halalii and to the rest of the spirits who asked him: “How is it, are they asleep?” Hanaaumoe answered: “No, they are not asleep yet?” At midnight Hanaaumoe again returned and called, the second time:"
"I mai o Kaneopa: “Aole makou i moe; ke kali aku nei no i na wahine palua a na hoewaa, palima a ke ’lii a Kahaookamoku.” Pane mai o Hanaaumoe e like me na olelo maluna, a hoi aku la; maopopo iho la iaia aole i pau i ka moe.","Kaneopa answered: “We are not asleep, we are waiting for the two wives apiece for the paddlers and the five wives for the chief Kahaookamoku.” Hanaaumoe again answered as he did before and then departed, being certain that the people were not asleep yet."

After studying the matter for a while he at last decided to dig a hole under the door sill; for he reasoned that the king would, upon entering the house, naturally sit on the door sill. All this time the rest of the people were in a deep sleep, no one was awake except Kaneopa. Kaneopa was sorry for the chief Kahaookamoku because he would surely be eaten up by the spirits and Kaneopa was at a loss to know how he was going to save him. Kaneopa tried to keep himself awake, but could only last until the crowing of the first cock, when he too became so overcome with sleep and moved under the door sill and sat in the hole. Just as soon as he entered the hole, Hanaaumoe arrived and he again called as before, for the third time. There was no answer. He called again, again there was no answer. Hanaaumoe then said: “You will surely be all killed. Why didn’t you sleep at Kauai instead of coming and sleep on the island of Halalii where the spirits live? You are as good as dead, there is no escape; your flesh, your bones, your bowels, your blood, your eyes, will all be eaten up.” During all this talk by Hanaaumoe, Kaneopa was listening. At the end Hanaaumoe [ ] returned to Halalii. Halalii then asked him: “How is it, are they asleep?” “Yes, they are asleep, let us be going,” said Hanaaumoe to the rest of the spirits."
"A hiki lakou i ka hale o Kaneopa ma e moe nei, komo ke akua a pau loa i loko o ka hale, noho iho la o Halalii ke ’lii ma ka paepae o ka puka.

The spirits were so numerous that they were without number. They made but one smack and the people disappeared, all eaten up by the spirits. The spirits then began digging up the floor of the house except that portion under the sill where Halalii was sitting. At the approach of day the spirits all returned to their home and Haneopa came out of his hiding place and limping to the canoe he pushed it into the sea and set sail for Kauai."
"Ia Kaneopa e holo aua i loko o ke kai, ku ana o Hanaaumoe ma ka lae kahakai, peahi ana ia Kaneopa: “E pae! e pae ka waa!” I mai o Kaneopa me ka olelo huhu: “E akua ai lepo o ke kanaka, kai no ua pau ko makou alii ia oukou; aole au e pae aku ana.”","While Kaneopa was on his way to Kauai, Hanaaumoe appeared on the coast and beckoned to Kaneopa, inviting him to land, saying: “Come ashore. Let the canoe come ashore.” Kaneopa then answered angrily: “You are a filthy old spirit. Didn’t you eat up our chief? I will not come ashore.”"
"A hiki o Kaneopa i Kauai, hai aku la i ke ’lii a me na kanaka, i ko lakou pau i ka ai ia e ke akua o Oahu nei, a koe ia ma kona maalea.

The king then asked the priest: “What must we do?” The priest, Hanakapiai, answered: “Proceed and hew out a countless number of wooden images that will look as near as possible to human beings.” After the images were ready, the king, the priest and a large number of followers set sail for Oahu and in course of time hove to directly off Leahi, when they saw Hanaaumoe appear on the coast and called out as he did the other time. Kaneopa, who was in the company on this second visit, said to the people who were with him: “That is Hanaaumoe the great flatterer. That is the spirit who deceived us and got us to land.” The king and priest in answer to the invitation replied: “Yes, we will land.” The people then all came ashore and approached the long house where Kahaookamoku and his companions had stayed and were eaten up by the spirits."

Let everybody be supplied with lights with which to set the house on fire as soon as all the spirits have entered the house.” Late that evening, the flatterer, the spirit Hanaaumoe came to the house and called out:"
"Aohe leo pane o loko, kahea hou, o ka lua ia, aole no he leo pane mai. Olelo iho ua o Hanaaumoe: “A ha ha! Ihea no la ka moe i Kauai, moe aku; lawe ia mai ka ka moe a ka moku akua o Halalii. Make!

Hanaaumoe then spoke to himself: “Ha, ha! Why didn’t you sleep on Kauai instead of coming here and sleep on the spirit island of Halalii? Dead, you will not be saved.” While Hanaaumoe was calling the people were listening. At the end of his call Hanaaumoe returned to Halalii and reported to him that the people were all asleep. Upon hearing this report Halalii issued a call that all the spirits be brought together; after this they proceeded to the long house at the beach. Upon coming up to the house the spirits all entered and Halalii sat on the door sill. The spirits then took up the wooden [ ] images and began eating them. “Oh, how tough!” was heard from one of the spirits. “So is the one I am eating,” said another. It was customary in days gone by for the king to receive the choicest portions of the meat, so these portions were given to Halalii by the spirits. Upon taking a bite at one of these choice portions, Halalii remarked: “Very tough.” The rest of the spirits answered: “All these people are very tough, not one of them is fat, they are all thin and tough. They are not at all like the first lot that came.”"
"Ia lakou e walea ana i ka ai i ke kii, hoopuni ia ae la ka hale a puni e na kanaka me ka momoku ahi, o ka manawa ia i puhi ia ai ka hale i ke ahi, a pau loa ke akua i ke ahi, a lilo aku o Hanaaumoe a pakele aku la.

Eleio was a very fast runner, faster than the wind, and could make three complete circuits of the island of Maui in one day. Because of his great speed, he was made runner to King Kakaalaneo. It was his duty as runner to bring (awa ) fish from Hana for the king. When a meal was about ready, Eleio would set out for Hana to bring fish and he would always return before the king sat down to eat. Once while he was on his way back, he met on the road Kaahualii, a spirit, who asked him for some fish. Eleio answered: “Take the hairs on your behind for the fish and your urine for water.” When Kaahualii heard this, he chased Eleio. Upon coming by Kamaalaea, Eleio’s sister who was residing at this place saw that her brother was out of breath, so she took down her pau and exposed herself to the spirit. This action so shamed the spirit that it abandoned Eleio. The name of this sister of Eleio was Pohakuloa. Being chased by this spirit on three different occasions along this same road, Eleio upon his next return trip went around the west side of Hana by way of Kaupo. Upon his arrival at Kaupo one day he found a woman by the name of Kanikaniaula sitting by the roadside, but he passed right along without noticing her. Kanikaniaula at this want of respect on the part of Eleio called out after him: “Say, are you going to pass right along without greetings?” When Eleio heard this call he turned back and greeted her. Kanikaniaula then invited him to the house which invitation was accepted by Eleio."
"Ia ia i hiki ai i Kaupo, e noho ana keia wahine i ke alanui, o Kanikaniaula ka inoa; kaha loa mai o Eleio hele ma ke alanui, kahea mai o Kanikaniaula: “Ea! Hele loa no ka, aole ka e aloha mai.” A lohe o Eleio i keia leo, huli aku la ia a aloha aku la. I mai o Kanikaniaula, e hoi ma ka hale, ae aku o Eleio.

Ua huna loa ia me ka ike ole o kana kane a hiki i kona la make, aole no hoi oia i olelo i kona alii ana.","Let us here take up a short sketch of Kanikaniaula. Kanikaniaula at the time when this conversation was taking place was dead. Although she appeared in the form of a live person it was really in spirit. Kanikaniaula was a very fine woman and came from a line of high chiefs of Hawaii. She, however, upon coming to live in Kaupo, Maui, married a person of low rank who lived in [ ] the back country. Their time was spent chiefly in the tilling of the soil and the preparation of food, stock raising and fishing. This was kept up until the death of Kanikaniaula. Upon her death the husband built a tomb, a small house of poles in the form of a pyramid, in which he placed the dead body of his wife. When she came to Maui to live she brought along with her from Hawaii a feather cape which was the insignia of a very high chief, but which article she had hidden up to the time of her death, nor had she ever once alluded to her rank as a high chiefess."

Ae mai o Kanikaniaula: “Ae, o ko’u haku ia; eia nae kahi makana au e lawe aku ai ia ia, he ahuula.” Ia wa ike ke kane, he ’lii o Kanikaniaula. “E hoi oe, a na po o Kane kii mai oe ia’u; e holo au i Hawaii i ko’u wahi, i keia mau la a hoi mai.” Hoi mai la o Eleio, me ka ahuula i kona a-i, e aahu ana. O ka ahuula, aole i loaa ia Kakaalaneo ko Maui alii.","When Eleio arrived at the house he saw a man occupying it but the woman was not to be seen. Eleio then asked the man: “Where is my companion?” The man asked in turn: “Who is your companion?” Eleio answered: “My companion was a woman.” “ She is dead, my own wife, she is laid in that small house yonder,” said the man. Eleio then asked the man: “How many days has she been lying there?” The husband answered: “Two days already, this is the third day in which we are speaking.” “Yes, I will undertake to bring your wife to life again,” said Eleio. Eleio then proceeded, and at the end of the fourth day Kanikaniaula was brought back to life and in all respects became as she was before her death. Kanikaniaula then asked Eleio: “What indeed shall I give you as a recompense? Shall it be myself?” Eleio answered: “I will not take anything in payment from you, but I wish you to become the wife of my lord, Kakaalaneo.” Kanikaniaula consented to this, saying: “Yes, he shall be my lord; but here is a present which I wish you to take to him; a feather cape.” At this the husband for the first time was made aware that Kanikaniaula was a chiefess. “You may now return and in the nights of Kane you may come for me. I am going to my place on Hawaii, and shall return in a few days.” Eleio then returned [home] wearing the feather cape tied around his neck. Feather capes at this time were so rare that even Kakaalaneo the king of Maui did not have one in his possession."
"Ma keia hele loihi ana o Eleio, ua huhu ke ’lii o Kakaalaneo, a kena ae la ia i kona mau ilamuku, e hoa ka umu a enaena, i umu e kalua ai ia Eleio ke hoi mai. Ua hoonoho aku o Kakaalaneo i na kiu e kiai i ka hoi mai o Eleio i ka pali o Aalaloloa, a ike i ka hoi mai, alaila, e hoa mai ko laila ahi i ike ko Lele nei poe, alaila, hoa ka umu i enaena mamua o ka hiki ana o Eleio. A hiki o Eleio ma ka pali o Aalaloloa, hoa ke ahi, ike ko Lele poe hoa i ka umu.","As Eleio had been absent a number of days, Kakaalaneo became very angry and ordered his chief officers to start an umu and make it very hot, in which to bake Eleio upon his return. In the meantime Kakaalaneo had posted spies along the Aalaloloa cliffs to watch for the return of Eleio, and when seen to start a fire as a signal to the people at Lele of his approach when the umu was to be started and made hot before the arrival of Eleio; so when Eleio arrived at the Aalaloloa cliffs, the fire signal was started and the people at Lele started the umu."
"Ma keia holo ikaika ana o Eleio me ka aahu i ka ahuula ma kona kua, a hiki i Lele, kahi o ka umu e hoa ia ana, e noho ana o Kakaalaneo ke ’lii.

When the king saw something red and pretty on Eleio’s shoulders, he called out to the men: “Seize Eleio! Seize Eleio!!” At this the people got ahold of Eleio and he was pulled out of the umu and was saved; but the feather cape was torn to pieces: a small piece, however, was saved in the hands of Eleio. Kakaalaneo then called Eleio to come to him and when he got in the presence of the king, the king asked him: “Where did you get this beautiful thing?” Eleio replied: “This was the cause of my delay. Kanikaniaula, a very handsome woman was dead and I brought her to life again. I have told her that you are to be her husband.” Kakaalaneo [ ] then asked Eleio: “Why didn’t you bring her along with you then?” Eleio replied: “I am to go and bring her in the nights of Kane.”"
"A hiki o Eleio i Kaupo, i na po o Kane, ua hoi mai o Kanikaniaula mai Hawaii mai, me na ’lii, me na kanaka, me na aahu ahuula.

When they reached Lele and stood before the king Kakaalaneo then took Kanikaniaula and they dwelt together, husband and wife. Not very long after this Kanikaniaula conceived a child."
"O keia hookauhua ana o Kanikaniaula, ke ’lii wahine, o ka loaa ana ia o Kaululaau, ka mea nana i huhuki ka ulu o Lele a hiki i keia la.

"A nui o Kaululaau, nui pu me na keiki a pau loa (i loko o ia kau e noho ana no kona makuakane o Kakaalaneo i alii no Maui a puni), pii ke kino o Kaululaau i ka nui pii pu me ke kalohe.

The intention of the king being, to procure servants and playmates for the coming heir. In due course of time the queen gave birth to a baby boy and he was called Kaululaau. All the children who were born on the same day on Maui were brought to the king and reared with the prince Kaululaau. As Kaululaau grew to manhood, so also grew his playmates, and as he grew older he became more and more mischievous. His father Kakaalaneo was then still king of Maui. In those days it was customary for the boys with him to climb the breadfruit trees and pick the fruit; and when the fruit got fewer and beyond their reach, Kaululaau would then pull up the trees with his hands. This was done so often that the trees became scarce in the district of Lele. At last the father Kakaalaneo, took pity on the people knowing that they would some day go hungry; so he ordered that all the boys be sent home to their parents, believing that this would make his son less mischievous; but instead of improving he grew worse. After considering the matter for some time, the father at last hit upon a course of action and thereupon told the queen and attendants to take Kaululaau and abandon him on Lanai with the spirits. This was agreed on by the chiefs and people and preparations were immediately made; the food and meat were cooked, kapa and other things were gotten ready and the canoes set out with Kaululaau. Upon their arrival at Lanai, Kaululaau was put ashore with all the things prepared for him and the canoes returned."
"A noho o Kaululaau i Lanai, komo aku la ia i loko o ka moku akulikuli a moe iho la. I loko o ka moe, olelo mai la kona aumakua ia ia: “E Kaululaau e!

Ninau mai la ke akua: “I hea kou wahi i moe ai i keia po?” “ I ka nalu uuku, i ka nalu nui ae oukou,” pela aku o Kaululaau.","When Kaululaau landed on Lanai he entered a patch of reeds and slept there. While in his sleep his god came to him and said: “Say, Kaululaau, get up and enter the cave with all your belongings.” When Kaululaau woke up he looked about him and saw a cave opening near by; so he got up and entered it in obedience to the instructions given him in his sleep. Lanai was an island of spirits. No people could live on this island as the spirits killed and eat everybody who came there. Kaululaau was, however, an exception to this as he was not eaten up; but this was because he was too cunning in telling falsehoods, just like Punia. [ ] That night Kaululaau slept in the cave and at daylight he left it and returned to the patch of reeds where he was found by the spirits who asked him: “Say, Kaululaau, where did you sleep last night?” Kaululaau replied: “In the small patch of thistles.” “Is that so? No wonder you were not found last night,” remarked the spirits. On the approach of the next night he again entered the cave, when the spirits went about looking for him the whole night. At daylight Kaululaau went to the beach on the dry sand and sat there where the spirits came and asked him: “Where did you sleep last night?” “In the patch of thorny vines growing there. That is the place where I slept.” The spirits again asked him: “Where are you going to sleep tonight?” Kaululaau replied: “In the large surf where it rolls as high as a house. That is where I will sleep.” On the approach of night Kaululaau would again retire to the cave, and at daylight go out on the sand where he would be met by the spirits who would ask him: “Where did you sleep last night?” “In the small surf; you were all at the large surf,” Kaululaau would reply."
"Ma keia hana hoopunipuni a Kaululaau, ua pau loa ke akua i ka make, a koe kakaikahi ke akua. O Pahulu ke akua i pakele, no kona holo ana mai Lanai aku a Kahoolawe; o Kaululaau hoi, e hoa mau ana ia i ke ahi i na la a pau loa o kona noho ana ma Lanai.

[ ]","Through these deceiving answers the spirits got so overworked that they mostly all died off, leaving but very few of them alive. Pahulu was one of the spirits that was saved, because he left Lanai and went over to Kahoolawe to live. Kaululaau after this kept a fire burning all the time he remained on Lanai. Kakaalaneo upon seeing the fire burning on Lanai so continuously, asked the people: “Say, Kaululaau could not have been killed by the spirits?” “No,” replied the people. Therefore, Kakaalaneo sent some people in a canoe to go to Lanai and see if Kaululaau was indeed still alive or not. When the canoe arrived at Lanai, the people saw that Kaululaau was indeed still alive and he was still keeping the fire burning. The canoe then returned to Lele and the people told Kakaalaneo, the king, of what they had seen. When the king heard this he remarked: “Yes, he was sent to Lanai to be devoured by the spirits, but no! What does it mean? Well and good.” He then ordered a double canoe to go and bring Kaululaau home. This is how Kaululaau was saved and his history and life on Lanai has become famous even unto this day. [ ]"

The name Nihooleki was given to his spirit body; his name during his life time was Keahaikiaholeha, a chief, and was the greatest fisherman over all the whole country of Waianae. It was he that owned the mother-of-pearl fish-hook called Pahuhu that could catch so much aku. He was at one time king of Waianae and had fished from all the head lands round about that country. He knew all the fish and fishing grounds in the ocean around that region. After a time he left his parents and young sister in Waianae and set sail for Waimea, Kauai, where he settled; for this was where his wife had come from, being her birthplace. [ ]"
"Ia Kaehaikiaholeha i hiki ai ilaila, lilo ae la no ia i alii no Kauai a puni, no ka mea, he ’lii kana wahine no Kauai a puni. O kana hana o ka lawaia i na la a pau loa, me ua pa ai nei ana o Pahuhu.

O kona mau waa e holo ai i ka lawaia, he mau kaulua, he umi ka loa, he iwakalua hoewaa, oia no hoi na kaohi.","When Keahaikiaholeha arrived at Waimea he became the king of the whole of Kauai as his wife was its high chiefess. It was his custom to go out fishing every day. This mother-of-pearl fish-hook, Pahuhu, was a great hook; every time it was let down into the sea and pulled up the aku would follow it into the canoe until the canoe was filled with them. The canoe in which he used to go fishing was a double canoe ten fathoms in length, and was manned by twenty paddlers who were its complement to steady the canoe while he fished for aku."
"A make o Kaehaikiaholeha, hoihoi ia mai a Kuukuua, i Waianae, waiho ia kona kino kupapau; i loko o ka hale puoa, o na makua, hana iho la laua ma ke ano hoomana o Hawaii nei, a ikaika ka uhane i ka hele mehe kanaka ola ala.

The parents then proceeded to worship the spirit, as was the custom in those days of Hawaii, until it became so strong that it could go about in the form of a live person. After the spirit of Keahaikiaholeha had waxed strong, it returned to Waimea, Kauai, and again took his former wife and lived with her as her husband. The wife was not aware that this was her husband’s spirit, fully believing that it was her husband in real flesh. It was while in this spirit form, that he was named Nihooleki. All he did during the day time was to sleep, not even taking food; the wife being the only one that took food. When the wife got hungry she would go to her brothers for food and meat. On one of her calls for food and meat the brothers asked her: “Where is your husband?” The sister replied: “He is at home asleep.” “You have a queer husband. All he does is to sleep at home. How is he to satisfy his wife’s hunger? Except we help you, you will not be able to live.” While this conversation was going on between them, the husband heard all that was being said and when the wife arrived home Nihooleki asked his wife: “Have your brothers any mother-of-pearl fish-hooks?” “They have some.” “Go and bring one.” When the sister arrived at her brothers’ they asked her: “What have you come for?” “I have come for a mother-of-pearl fish-hook for your brother-in-law.” “That is right, that will get you something to live on. Here is a hook for the use of which we will charge ten aku. Here is another one for twenty aku,” etc. The wife took one of the hooks and returned. When she entered the house and approached where her husband was sleeping she called out:"
"E ala e Nihooleki, E ala e Nihooleki, Kaihele ka po, Kaihele ke ao, He mau maka hia-a ko ka lawaia, E ala eia ka pa a kaua.","Wake up Nihooleki, Wake up Nihooleki, The night comes and goes, The day comes and goes; The fishermen have sleepless eyes. Wake up, here is our mother-of-pearl fish-hook."
"Ninau aku ke kane: “Heaha ka pa?” “He lalakea,” pela mai ka wahine. “He pa ai ole.”","The husband asked: “What kind of a mother-of-pearl fish-hook is it?” “It is one resembling the glitter of a white shark,” answered his wife. “It is the one the fish will not bite at.”"
"Elua no aku, Na ke ’kua kane, Na ke ’kua wahine, O na lima o na kaohi ke oopa. Auhea la kahi pahuhu iki, A kane i ai a koe koena, [ ] E kau ana ma ka hakala, E kiai ana ka Noio, E lawe ana ke au i Makaena? Kahi i laha mai ai ke aku, Kuhi ka lima lea ka haawi, Ai ka mauwale, Ai ka pehu o uka o Waiahulu e.","It will catch but two aku. One for the male spirit, One for the female spirit. The arms of the paddlers would become uselessly lame. Where is the small pahuhu, The one partly eaten by Kane? [ ] Hanging there at the gable end Being watched by a noio. The current is flowing towards Makaena Where swarm the aku, Where the giving would be a pleasure, When the worthless could have a share, When the hungry up at Waiahulu could also have a share."
"Hele hou ka wahine a hiki i na kaikunane: “Heaha kau?” “I olelo mai nei kuu kane, aohe ai o ka pa, elua no ka aku, aole e lea ka haawi.” I mai na kaikunane: “A auhea ka pa ai?” Olelo mai nei kuu kane aia ka i ka hakala o ka hale kahi i kau ai, he Noio ke kiai.

A hiki ka wahine me ka pa i ko laua hale, e moe ana no ke kane, kahea iho la: “E ia ka pa, he Pahuhu,” olelo ae o Nihooleki.","At this the wife again returned to the brothers. “What is it you want?” [they asked]. “My husband says the fish-hook is no good; it will catch but two aku and one cannot at that rate give any away willingly,” replied the sister. The brothers again asked: “Where is the fish-hook that would induce the fish to bite more freely?” “My husband said that it is the one hanging up at the gable end of the house being watched by the noio.” When they made a search sure enough they found a mother-of-pearl fish-hook that was being watched by the small black bird; it was Pahuhu. The noio was the supernatural bird sister of Nihooleki. Upon the arrival of the wife at their house, the husband was still asleep. She then called: “Here is the mother-of-pearl fish-hook.” “It is a Pahuhu,” Nihooleki answered."
"He pa ai ia, Kuhi ka lima, Lea ka haawi, Ai ka mauwele, Ai ka pehu o uka, O Waiahulu e.","That is the mother-of-pearl fish-hook that the fish want, You can then point with the hand, You can give with pleasure. The worthless can share, The hungry can also have a share Up at Waiahulu."
"Kiola iho la ka wahine i ka pa a ka poho lima o ia nei; ala ae la keia honi, a uwe iho la; o ke kumu o keia uwe ana, o kona kaawale ana i loko o ka make, a kaawale kana mau oihana lawaia.

He then rose, kissed it and wept over it. The reason why he wept was, because of his death he was thus kept away from his one great pleasure, fishing. After the fish-hook was secured, Nihooleki said to his wife: “Go and get a canoe from your brothers. Not the one of five fathoms in length, nor the single canoe, but get me the double one that is ten fathoms in length. After you have secured the canoe, ask for twenty paddlers.” When the wife arrived in the presence of her brothers, they asked her: “Here you are again, what do you want?” She replied: “I want a canoe.” “Yes, you shall have one, take the one that is five fathoms in length.” “That is not the one he wants. He wants a double canoe that is ten fathoms in length.” “That cannot be. There is no double canoe of that size, nor would he be able to make use of it.” The sister replied: “He said there is such a canoe. It is in the canoe shed.” When a search was made they found one."
"A loaa na waa, kau na kanaka he iwakalua, hoe a hiki imua o Nihooleki, ike iho la no ia o kona mau waa no i ka wa e ola ana. I aku ia i ka wahine: “He punahele no oe i ou kaikunane?” “Ae.” “O hele a olelo aku, o na kanaka he iwakalua i mau kaohi na’u.” [ ]",When the canoe was secured the twenty paddlers jumped aboard and took it to Nihooleki. When Nihooleki saw the canoe he knew at once it was the same one that was owned by him when he was alive. He then asked his wife: “Are you a favorite with your brothers?” “Yes.” “Go and tell them that I want twenty men to steady the canoe with.” [ ]
"A makaukau na hoewaa, a me ka waa, oioi mai la lakou a kokoe i ke awa, no ko lakou manao i ke kani-hana-moa e holo ai i ka lawaia, e like me ke ano mau o na lawaia, aole ka ’uanei peia.

At the first crow of the cock the men got to the canoe; at the last crowing of the cock they pushed the canoe out. By this time all the other fishermen were out at sea. The men, however, still waited until daylight. When it became light enough to distinguish the features of the men they went back to the house feeling indifferent."
"O Nihooleki, ke moe nei me ka noonoo no. Hoala iho la ka wahine: “E ala, e holo, o ka wa oluolu keia o ka lawaia ana, aole e ohea i ka la.” “Pela a ao, a puka ka la.” Ala ae la o Nihooleki, a ke ka, a ka hokeo, hume i ka malo, hele aku la a na waa panee aku la, hookahi lima, lana ana na waa i loko o ke kai, holo mai la na hoewaa a kau iluna.

The wife aroused him: “Wake up and make a start; this is the coolest time for the fishermen, when one is not made lazy by the heat of the sun.” He answered: “Wait until it is light; at sunrise.” Nihooleki then arose, got the bailing cup, reached for the calabash in which were kept all the fishing utensils, affixed his malo, then went out to the canoe and with one hand pushed it out into the sea. The paddlers then came down and jumped aboard. As soon as they got under way Nihooleki took out the fish-hook and began fishing. The aku came in such large numbers that in no time the canoe was loaded. They took this catch and threw it ashore. They went out and got a second canoe load and again it was thrown ashore. This was kept up until six canoe loads had been landed. By this time a large mound of fish had been piled up. The wife proceeded to give away, feed the pigs, give some to the loafers, sell some, and salt some, but a large number were still left over, there being so many. The people from the uplands came down with food, sugar-cane, bananas and everything else good to eat and all went home with fish, even those that came down without anything went home with their share. Those who were still in the uplands when they heard of the fish came down and returned with their share."

When his brothers-in-law saw his well-formed body they called out, “Puipuiakalawaia,” making this his third name. Upon their arrival at Makaena, off Waianae, the men looked up and saw that they had reached the island of Oahu. Nihooleki again fished until the canoe was filled with aku. He then ordered his men to eat. After their meal when every one was satisfied the remaining fish were thrown out until the canoe was bare, when they set off until they landed at Kaunolu, in Lanai, where they again caught some fish and eat till satisfied. Again they set sail until they reached Keauhou, at Kona, Hawaii, when Nihooleki told his men: “You may all go ashore here while I remain with our canoe. When you go ashore, take each of you one aku apiece. There are twenty of you, making twenty aku. When you get to that shed of coconut leaves in front of that house, where women are seated, throw down the fish, but don’t look back.” The men then went ashore while Nihooleki turned the canoe around. On the return of the men they immediately set sail for Kauai, and the same day reached the Kauai waters where the brothers-in-law were fishing. Nihooleki produced the hook and again the aku came tumbling into the canoe until it was sunk deep in the water with fish. When the brothers-in-law looked up they saw the canoe and the fish; the canoe was so full that the men had to stand up. Upon their return to shore Nihooleki took up two aku for the male and female spirits, [ ] took a bath and went home, and told his wife: “Go to the paddlers and give them that canoe load of fish.” He then went in and laid down. The fish from the first catch were beginning to get spoiled."
"Hoi aku la no keia moe. O ka ia mua, ua pilau. Pela no ka lawaia ana a loihi na la, kui aku la keia pihe ia a lohe o Kamapuaa, i uka o Waiohulu, olelo iho o Kamapuaa: “Na’u ia ia o kuu hiki ole i kai.” O Kamapuaa, he aikane na Nihooleki, a o Kamapuaa hoi, he pehu kona mai, aohe hiki i ka hele; nolaila, auamo na kanaka, a o ke kaumaha haalele, pela no ka iho ana a hiki i kai. Mamua o ka holo ana o Nihooleki i ka lawaia, olelo aku i ka wahine: “I iho mai auanei ke kanaka pehu, o ko kane ia kahea ia aku, o kuu aikane ia.”","This was kept up for many days and everybody had fish. One day the news about the great catches was carried to Kamapuaa in the uplands of Waiohulu. Kamapuaa upon hearing the great catches said: “I could get some of that fish if I can only get down to the coast.” Kamapuaa was the friend of Nihooleki; he was afflicted with the dropsy and was not able to walk; therefore some people carried him down to the beach; but being very heavy the men could only carry him a little ways at a time. By constant begging he however managed to get to the seashore. Before Nihooleki set out on a certain day to fish he gave his wife the following instruction: “In case a man with the dropsy should come, call him in as he is my friend.”"
"A hala aku o Nihooleki i ka lawaia, hiki o Kamapuaa a kiai ana i ka puka o ka hale: “Kanaka pilau, hele pela,” pela mai ka wahine.

Kamapuaa with the men that carried him down, went over to the hog pen and there waited for the return of Nihooleki his friend. When Nihooleki returned with the fish, he came and kissed his friend, and then turned to his wife and said: “You are indeed strange. I told you to take good care of my friend, but you have not done so. Never mind, you may stay, but I am going along with my friend.” He then told his friend to give some of the fish to the men who brought him down. The men took all they could carry away, but still many fish were left."
"A makaukau laua e haalele ia Waimea a me ka wahine, i aku o Nihooleki i ka wahine: “O ke keiki au e hapai nei, kapa iho oe i kuu inoa, o Kaehaikiaholeha; eia ka hoailona ke imi ae ia’u, o kuu laau a me kuu ahuula.” A lohe ka wahine i keia kauoha, uwe iho la.

[ ]","When Nihooleki and Kamapuaa were ready to leave Waimea and the wife, Nihooleki addressed his wife saying: “When you give birth to the child within you, call him by my name, Keahaikiaholeha. Here are the tokens by which I shall know him should he search for me, my club and my feather cape.” When the wife heard these instructions she wept: by these words the wife knew that this was her own husband, Keahaikiaholeha. When the chiefs and his brothers-in-law heard that this was the king, they came chasing after him. He and his friend then dove into the sea and swam under water until they came up at Kuukuua, at Waianae. One of the Kauai chiefs, however, came following behind them named Pohakuokauai, the same being that rock which is seen at Waianae even to this day. As they drew near to the house where the parents and sister of Nihooleki were living and near to the tomb where his dead body was laid, Nihooleki then turned to his friend and said: “Where are you? When you reach our parents ask them: ‘Where is my companion that came along with me?’ They will then give you an answer. Then ask them where certain things that belonged to me are. Proceed and take up the threshold where you will find my war helmet; under the place where our sister sleeps you will find a feather cape; at the foot of her sleeping place you will find the lei palaoa; and at the corner in the house is a kahili. Take our sister and make her your wife as she is fair to look upon and is also of proper age.” At the close of his friend’s instructions, Kamapuaa continued on his way until he came in the presence of his friend’s parents and sister. After proving himself a friend of Nihooleki’s by producing the different articles in obedience to the instructions given him by his friend he was married to the sister of Nihooleki. Keahaikiaholeha, who was Nihooleki, entered the tomb and disappeared. Thus ends this story. [ ]"

Kuaikalolo and Aiakoake were the elders of Kepakailiula. Kiinoho and Kiihele were the brothers of Hina. All Kiinoho did was to sit in one place and very seldom moved around; he was, however, a very great fortune teller and could predict coming events that happen in the very near future as well as events afar off. All that Kiihele did was to travel. He was a great runner and could make the circuit of Hawaii in one day, starting from home in the morning and arriving home before sunset of the same day. These people were chiefs of the district of Puna, of very high rank, as were their ancestors before them."

Kiihele was, however, very indifferent about the matter and did not believe in what Kiinoho told him. Shortly after this they both had the same dream repeated to them. At daylight they talked the matter over and decided that they must accept the invitation and go and live in Paliuli. They then made their preparations and procured certain things by the lau (four hundred), such as hogs, awa, fish, fowls, kapas and malos. That night they retired early and at the second crowing of the cock in the early dawn, while it was still dark, they got up and started for Paliuli without the knowledge of their sister or people."
"Ua olelo ia ma keia kaao, o ka mua keia o ka loaa ana o Paliuli i ke kanaka, mai ke ’kua mai, a mahope hoi hou i ke ’kua, nolaila, nalo o Paliuli a hiki i keia la.","It is said in this story that this was the first time that Paliuli was found by man, through the direction of the gods. Afterwards it was again taken away from man by the gods and it has been hidden ever since."

They began to cultivate the soil, raised different animals until the place was filled with everything imaginable. The sugar-cane grew until it fell over and rose again, the bananas fell scattering, the hogs grew until the tusks were long; the chickens until their spurs were long and sharp; and the dogs until their backs were broadened out."
"I aku o Kiihele ia Kiinoho: “Kupanaha kaua, nawai la auanei e ai keia mau mea a kaua e hana nei?” I mai la o Kiinoho: “Na ke keiki a kaua na Kepakailiula. [ ] E kii kaua.” Iho aku la laua mai Paliuli aku a hiki i Keaau, kahi o ko laua kaikuahine, o Hina e noho ana.","One day Kiihele said to Kiinoho: “How queer of us to care for all these things! Who is going to eat them?” Kiinoho replied: “Our son Kepakailiula. Let us go and [ ] bring him here.” They then proceeded from Paliuli and went down to Keaau, where their sister Hina was living."
"Eia hoi, mamua aku o ko laua hoi ana i Paliuli, e hookauhua ana o Hina i ke keiki, a hiki hou laua, ua hapai o Hina, aole nae i hanau. A pau ke aloha ana a me ka uwe ana, eu ae la o Hina e hele i waho e hoolualu ai. I aku o Kiinoho ia Kiihele. “E kii aku oe i ke keiki.” I mai o Kiihele: “Aia ihea?” “Aia i kahi e noho la o Hina.” A hiki o Kiihele i kahi o Hina i noho ai, e waiho ana he huamoa. Lawe ae la keia a wahi i ka ahuula o ka manu. Hoi aku la laua a hiki i Paliuli, hana iho la o Kiinoho ma kona mana, a hala ke anahulu oia he umi po, wehe aku la i ka ahuula, ua kino, he keiki maikai loa, a nana iho la laua aohe ona lua e ku ai. Waiho hou laua a hala na anahulu eha (oia he kanaha po), nana hou laua, he keu o ka nani a me ka maikai. Aohe puu, aohe kee, pali ke kua, mahina ke alo; o kona ili a puni, ua like me ka ahuula ka ula o ka ili a me na maka. Ua lilo o Kepakailiula i ahi no Paliuli, ka ula mau i ke ao a me ka po, no kona maikai loa, a o kona lua e like ai, o ka pele o Kilauea.

Nolaila, ua kapaia o Kepakailiula: “O ka hiapo o ka Hiwahiwa o Paliuli.”","Before these two went to Paliuli, however, Hina showed signs of being with child. Upon their return she was almost ready to be confined. After greetings were exchanged and their weeping ended, Hina rose and went out to relieve herself. As Hina rose to go out, Kiinoho requested Kiihele to go out, saying: “Go out and get the child.” Kiihele asked: “Where is it?” “At the place where Hina is sitting.” When Kiihele came to the place he saw an egg lying on the ground. He took it up and wrapped it in a feather cape; and they returned to Paliuli, where Kiinoho exercised all his powers and at the expiration of ten days and nights he unwrapped the feather cape and saw the egg had formed into a beautiful child; after inspecting it they concluded there was none like him. The child was again wrapped up in the feather cape and left for a period of forty nights before they again looked at it. When they did they saw that the child had grown more beautiful; no pimples, no deformities, straight back, open face; its skin and eyes were as red as the feather cape which enwrapped him. Thus did Kepakailiula become the fire that lighted up Paliuli by day and by night, whose only equal was Pele of Kilauea. Pele gave light from the crater of Kilauea, while Kepakailiula gave light from Paliuli, giving Puna and Hilo two red objects to view by day and by night. Kepakailiula was therefore called “The first-born of the beloved one of Paliuli.” Kepakailiula would not touch either ordinary food or meat; all he eat was bananas, one bunch for each meal."
"Aohe ai o Kepakailiula i ka ai a me ka ia, hookahi ana mea ai o ka maia, hookahi ahui, hookahi ai ana. Nana aku o Kiinoho a me Kiihele i ke keiki, a o ka wahine ole, i iho: “U!

He looked her over and admired her beauty; yes, she was indeed good looking, but she had one fault, her eyes bulged out like the nut of the kukui. He therefore gave up Kukuilauania and continued his search, passing from Hilo into Hamakua. Failing to find one to his liking, he passed on into Kohala where he was still unable to find a woman. After looking over the dark rocks of Kaniku he decided to return. Upon his arrival at Paliuli, Kiinoho asked him: “How was your journey?” Kiihele replied: “I have found no wife.” On this same day, he [again left Paliuli and] continued his search into Puna, until he met a woman by the name of Kahala. She was very beautiful, except that her posterior resembled the pandanus fruit of the present day, so he passed on into Kau where he found Manienie. She too was very beautiful, but her lips were deformed so he discarded her and continued his search, Kiihele left Kau and passed into Kona where he found Makolea, a woman who was as faultless as the full moon. Kahaluu was her father and Keauhou was her mother. Makolea, however, had been pledged to marry Kakaalaneo the king of Maui, for Makolea was a princess, her parents being the king and queen of Kona. [ ] When it was reported that Kakaalaneo was so expert a spearsman, that he could hit a blade of grass, an ant, or a flea, at one throw of the spear, the parents became afraid and gave Makolea to Kakaalaneo."
"Hele aku la o Kiihele a ku ma ka puka o ka hale o Makolea, aloha aku la keia: “Aloha olua.” Aloha mai la o Makolea a me kona kahu. Ma ko laua ike ana mai ia Kiihele, he kanaka maikai loa imua o ko Kona poe iho, a hoohie, a hookohukohu mai la ka laua la kamailio. Kahea mai la laua la: “Komo mai,” komo aku la o Kiihele a ma ka nio o ka puka noho iho la. Ninau mai la o Makolea: “Mahea mai oe?” I aku o Kiihele: “Maanei mai nei.” “Heaha kau huakai o keia la hao?” “He imi wahine.” “Nau no?” pela mai o Makolea. I aku o Kiihele: “Na ka maua keiki.” I mai o Makolea: “Me oe iho la no ka maikai?” “Aole, he ili wawae ko’u maikai no kona maikai.” A lohe ke ’lii wahine i keia olelo a Kiihele, ua hakui kona puuwai e launa koke. I aku ia Kiihele: “O kii hoi ha i ka’u kane a lawe mai, mai lohi oe.”","Kiihele approached the house in which Makolea was living and stood by the door and saluted the two people within, which salutation was returned by Makolea and her attendant. At the sight of Kiihele, Makolea and her attendant were much impressed with his manliness and beauty, being much superior to that of the people of Kona; so they were over anxious to please him and his call was made very pleasant. The two then invited Kiihele to enter, which invitation was accepted and Kiihele entered and sat down by the door. Makolea then asked him: “Where are you from?” Kiihele answered: “I came along the road.” “What is the object of this unannounced visit?” “I am in search of a wife.” “For yourself?” asked Makolea. “For our son,” answered Kiihele. “Is he as handsome as yourself?” continued Makolea. “No, I am but as the skin on his feet.” When the princess heard the answers made by Kiihele, she became excited and wanted to meet the young man right away; so she told Kiihele: “Go and bring the man whom you wish to be my husband and don’t be slow.”"
"Hoi aku la o Kiihele a hiki i Paliuli, ninau mai o Kiinoho: “Pehea kau huakai?” I aku o Kiihele: “Ua loaa ka wahine no Kona, o Makolea.” Ae mai o Kiinoho: “Ae, he wahine maikai na, ua palama ia a na Kakaalaneo ke ’lii o Maui.” (Ma kona ike kilokilo keia olelo.) “A hea hele kakou?” “Aia a apopo, a kela la aku, pela wau i olelo aku nei.” Hookahi no keia la a Kiihele, e hele nei a hoi i Paliuli.","Kiihele at once returned to Paliuli and upon his arrival, Kiinoho asked him: “How was your journey?” Kiihele replied: “I have found a wife in Kona, Makolea by name.” Kiinoho said: “Yes, she is a handsome woman; she is betrothed to Kakaalaneo the king of Maui (he was able to know this through his knowledge as a fortune teller). When are we to go to her?” “I told her we were coming on the day after tomorrow.” Kiihele did this all in one day, going and returning to Paliuli."
"I loko o ia mau la, uwe paiauma o Kiinoho a me Kiihele ia Paliuli, i ka haalele, honi i na mea a pau loa, pela laua i aloha ai ia Paliuli. A hiki i ka la e hele ai o lakou, haawi o Kiinoho a me Kiihele ia Paliuli no ke ’kua, oia ka nalo a hiki i keia la o Paliuli, aole ike hou ia.","During the two days before they were to leave Paliuli, Kiinoho and Kiihele wailed and mourned because of their deep attachment for Paliuli and they kissed every object in their beautiful home. When the day of their departure arrived, Kiinoho and Kiihele left Paliuli in charge of the gods; hence the disappearance of Paliuli until this day; no one has ever seen it since."
"A hele lakou, ku ae la o Kiihele me Kepakailiula a hele, me ka paa o ke keiki i ka ahuula, ua wahi ia a paa. O Kiinoho, noho iho la ia, huli hope aku o Kiihele a olelo aku: “Ka!

Kiinoho, however, would not move, so Kiihele turned back and said: “How strange of you, are you to remain when our son is to leave the place?” Upon hearing this Kiinoho followed. On this same day, they reached Kona and the home of Makolea, where Kepakailiula and Makolea became husband and wife. Kepakailiula then spoke to his foster parents: “Here is your wife, Makolea’s attendant; you two must take her as your wife. After you are gone from here, give attention, should I die, continue on; but if I am still alive, then all will be well.” * * *"
"Noho aku la laua hookahi hana o ka moe, a haohao na makua i ka ike ole ia aku o Makolea, no ka mea he wahi kaawale ko laua. Hele mai la laua e nana, a ike iho la laua, he kane ke kumu o ka nalo ana.

Ala mai la o Kepakailiula [ ] a na makua, hele mai la mauka a Kohala, makai na waa me ka wahine. A hiki i Kohala, holo loa na waa i Maui, noho lakou i Kohala.","After Kepakailiula and Makolea had become husband and wife, they did nothing but sleep, so that the parents of Makolea wondered at the continued absence of their daughter; as she lived in a separate house, they decided to come and learn the cause of this absence. When they entered the house they found that a husband was the cause of her disappearance. They immediately took her, placed her in a canoe to sail for Maui, leaving Kepakailiula behind still asleep. When Kepakailiula woke up he went to his foster parents and informed them of what had happened. They then went overland [ ] to Kohala, his wife going by sea with canoes. Upon their arrival there, the canoes continued on to Maui, but they dwelt in Kohala."
"O Kukuipahu ke ’lii o Kohala ia wa, a he wahi kaikamahine hookahi kana, o Kapuaokeonaona kona inoa, aole nae i nui loa, aka, he helehelena maikai kona ke nana aku. Nana mai la o Kukuipahu ia Kepakailiula, a o ke kanaka maikai, lawe ae la ia i keiki ponoi nana, a malama iko la, a olelo aku la o Kukuipahu: “Eia kau wahi wahine kou poohiwi o ka po e moe ai.”","At this time Kukuipahu was the king of Kohala, who had an only daughter named Kapuaokeonaona; she was not very big, but had very pretty features to look at. When Kukuipahu saw Kepakailiula, that he was handsome and manly, he took him to be as his own son, brought him to his home and said: “Here is your wife, your pillow to rest on at night.”"
"Ekolu la i hala i ko lakou noho ana i Kohala, po iho, a moe loko o ka hale, hele aku la o Kepakailiula a ka lae kahakai, ilaila he wahi waa, holo aku la ia i Maui ma Hana, ilaila o Makolea, me Kakaalaneo e noho ana. A pae i uka, nana aku la ia, ua ona o Kakaalaneo i ka awa, i loko o ia ona awa o Kakaalaneo, kahea mai la i ka wahine:","After they had been in Kohala for about three days, on the night of this third day while everybody was asleep, Kepakailiula went to a point on the seashore where a canoe was lying, boarded it and set sail for Hana, Maui, where Makolea was at that time living with Kakaalaneo. Upon landing, he looked and saw that Kakaalaneo was drunk with awa. In his intoxicated condition he called out to Makolea:"
"Makolea, Makolea, Hoi aku oe a ka aleo, Haliilii i ka moena Hoholo ke kapa, ka uluna, Hoi aku kaua ilaila e moe ai.","Makolea, Makolea, Return to the house. Spread out the mat, The bed clothes and pillow For we shall sleep there."
"Hele aku la o Makolea me na wahine, haliilii a paa, hoi mai la. Hiki o Kepakailiula, hana lepo iluna o ka moena a paele. Lawe aku la o Makolea ia Kakaalaneo a luna o ka moena, paele i ka hana lepo. “Kupanaha oe; ua ike no hoi paha oe he lepo ko keia wahi, haliilii no oe. E lawe ka moena a na hope o na waa haliilii, ilaila kaua e moe ai.” Hoi aku la lau a ma ka hope o na waa moe, ke pee nei o Kepakailiula.

Kepakailiula then entered the house and besmeared excrement on the mat. Soon after this Makolea and Kakaalaneo entered and sat on the besmeared mat, when Kakaalaneo said: “How strange of you to spread out the mats on this place knowing that it is covered with filth. Take the mats and spread them at the end of the canoe, where we will retire for the night.” After they had retired thither, Kepakailiula who was in hiding, came out, and when Kakaalaneo was sound asleep, took Makolea in the bushes and there they enjoyed themselves till near dawn. Kepakailiula returned to Hawaii without being seen and, landing at Kohala, went home, entered the house and slept by his young wife. When the king’s breakfast was ready he was called; he rose and took breakfast."
"I ka lua o ka po, pela no ka ia nei hana. A hiki keia i Maui, ma Hana, e moe ana no o Kakaalaneo me Makolea ma hope o na waa, lalau iho la no keia i ka wahine lawe. O ke kane, o Kakaalaneo, lawe aku la keia a ke kiona hana lepo, kukulu i ke poo ilalo, o na wawae iluna, aohe eu ae, ua ona i ka awa. Moe laua a kokoke i ka wa hoi o ia nei, uwe mai o Makolea:","On the second night, he again repeated his visit to Hana, Maui. Upon going ashore he found Kakaalaneo and Makolea asleep back of the canoes; he took his wife away, while he took Kakaalaneo and stood him up on his head on a dung heap, where he remained all night, being drunk with awa. They slept together till it was about time for him to return, when Makolea cried saying:"
"Aloha wale oe i ka make; O kuu kane, he akamai i ka o ihe, Aoe hala ka puamauu, Ka naonao, ka ukulele.","How sad I am of your coming fate. My husband is a skillful spearsman, He never misses a grass blade, An ant, or a flea [ukulele]."
"He hua kona, he hua ko’u. He laho kona, he laho ko’u. He keiki kane ia, he keiki kane au. Aole i akaka na ai, nana paha, na’u paha. [ ]","He has fruit, I have fruit. He has testes, I have testes. He is a male child, I am a male child. No one can say who will win out, whether he, or I. [ ]"
"Olelo aku la o Kepakailiula: “E hoi au, e kali oe, elua la e hala ia’u, i ke kolu hiki au, kukulu oe i lepa nou,” a hoi kela i Kohala.","Kepakailiula then continued, saying: “I am going [home] and you must remain. After two days have passed, on the third day I will be back again. You must put up a flag to show me your whereabouts.” He then set out for Kohala."
"Ala ae la na mea a pau i ke kakahiaka nui, e ku mai ana o Kakaalaneo i ke kiona hoolei lepo, kii ia aku la. O Kakaalaneo, he wahi ike kona ma ke ano kilokilo, e like me Kiinoho. Olelo mai la: “U!

I aku ke kane: “Ke uwe la oe i ko kane ia Kepakailiula; e make ana ia’u kau kane ke ike aku au.”","When everybody woke up in the morning they saw Kakaalaneo standing in the dung heap [head down]: so they hastened and removed him from his uncomfortable position. Kakaalaneo being also a fortune teller, like Kiinoho, after coming to himself, said: “Yes, you have escaped me this time because my eyes have failed me, for my spear never misses a blade of grass, an ant, or a flea, while your shadow is much larger. I will kill you [yet].” When Makolea heard the boast of Kakaalaneo, she wept for Kepakailiula. Her husband upon seeing her weeping said: “You are weeping for Kepakailiula your paramour. I shall kill him when I see him.”"
"A hiki o Kepakailiula i Kohala, moe a hiki i ka wa ala, ninau aku keia i kahi wahine opiopio, ia Kapuaokeonaona: “He punahele no oe i ko makuakane?” Ae mai kela: “Ae, ma ka’u e olelo ai malaila kela.” “Ae, e olelo oe i ko makuakane, o na kanaka a pau o Kohala nei, e holo i ka makaikai me a’u i Maui; aohe kanaka a noho, o ka mea ku ae a hina iho ke noho; o na kane, o na wahine, na keiki e hele; o na waa a pau loa o Kohala nei.”","When Kepakailiula reached Kohala he immediately retired. Upon waking up in the morning, he asked his young wife, Kapuaokeonaona: “Are you much thought of by your father?” She answered: “Yes, he will do whatever I ask him.” “All right then, go to your father and tell him that you wish all the people of Kohala to go to Maui with me on a visit. No one shall stay behind except those that are unable to walk. Ask for all the men, women and children and let all the canoes of Kohala be furnished for this voyage.”"
"A lohe o Kukuipahu, holo ka luna e kala, hookahi la, i ka lua akoakoa, a i ke kolu o ka la holo i Maui. Ua uhi paapu ia ka moana e na waa, aohe ike ia o ka ale. Ma keia holo ana o Kepakailiula me kahi wahine opio, o Kapuaokeonaona, o na makuakane elua, o Kiinoho me Kiihele, a me ka laua wahine, ma ko lakou waa, o Kukuipahu ma kona waa, mahope na waa a pau loa.

On the second day the people came together and on the third day they started for Maui. The ocean was so entirely covered with the canoes that it was impossible to see the waves. On this voyage Kepakailiula and his young wife Kapuaokeonaona, his two foster fathers Kiinoho and Kiihele and their wife were in one canoe; Kukuipahu was all by himself in his canoe, while the rest of the people in their canoes followed behind. The entire distance from Kohala to Hana was covered with the canoes making the Alenuihaha channel look red: hence the old saying, “Kohala is crowded to its uttermost ends with people.” When the canoes reached Hana, Kepakailiula’s canoe was the only one that landed while the others laid to in the offing. Kepakailiula upon jumping ashore was urged upon by his fathers, Kiinoho and Kiihele, that they be permitted to follow him, but their son would not consent to their coming ashore, saying: “No, you two must remain on the canoe, in case of my death in this encounter, you will have your means of escaping to Hawaii, but in case I live then come ashore.”"
"Ua piha o Hana i na ’lii a me na kanaka, ua makaukau no ke kaua a Kakaalaneo ko lakou alii. A lele o Kepakailiula a ku i ke one maloo, uwa ka aha, no ke kanaka maikai.

[ ]","Hana on this occasion was filled with the chiefs and men, who were ready to fight for Kakaalaneo their king. As Kepakailiula stood on the sand, the crowd shouted in admiration of his beauty and manliness. He then walked further inland until he reached solid ground, where he stood twirling his war club called Oleloikahie. Kakaalaneo upon seeing Kepakailiula came up to meet him, holding two spears, one in his right hand and one in his left. Kakaalaneo was noted as a spearsman from Hawaii to Kauai. No chief or soldier equaled him for his great strength. He could hit a blade of grass, an ant, and even a flea with his spear. Because of this great skill and strength, the kings of Hawaii, Oahu and Kauai were afraid of Kakaalaneo. [ ]"
"Olelo mai o Kakaalaneo: “Ia wai ka mua, i ka malihini i ke kamaaina?” I aku o Kepakailiula: “I ke kamaaina ka mua, i ka malihini ka hope.” Ia wa pahu o Kakaalaneo i ka ihe, me ka manao ua ku o Kepakailiula, a kokoke ka ihe, wehe o Kepakailiula i ka poaeae akau, a komo ka ihe, maloko, puliki ae la i ke kino o ka ihe.

Manao iho la o Kakaalaneo ua ku o Kepakailiula i ka ihe ana. Paha iho la:","As Kakaalaneo drew near he said: “Who shall have the first chance? Shall it be the stranger or the son of the soil?” Kepakailiula replied: “Let the son of the soil have the first chance and the stranger the last.” As soon as this was said, Kakaalaneo threw his spear with the full belief that he would hit Kepakailiula. As the spear neared Kepakailiula, he made a quick motion of the right elbow outward and allowed the spear to enter in between his arm and body and then closed his arm again on the spear, as the wind whistled by and the point of the spear quivered. The spear was held this way for a moment and was then thrown onto the dung heap. Kakaalaneo believed he had surely hit Kepakailiula, so expressed his delight in the following chant:"
"Ku aku la i kuu ihe, Aole e hala ka’u ihe ke o; Ku ka puamauu Ka naonao, ka uku, Me oe hoi he aka nui, Make, a o e ola.","I have hit him with my spear, My spear never misses its object when thrown At a blade of grass, At an ant, at a flea, Why should it miss you a larger object? Die, you shall not escape."
"A kiola o Kepakailiula i ka ihe, nana mai la o Kakaalaneo, a olelo mai:","When Kepakailiula threw the spear away, Kakaalaneo looked on and said:"
"Heaha la ka mea i hala ai kuu ihe, I kulaina paha e ke Kona, I oniu ia paha e ka lauawa, Pakele oe i kuu akau Loaa oe i ka ihe o kuu hema. Make oe aole oe e ola.","Why did my spear miss the mark? Was it pushed from its course by a southern storm? Or warded off by the lauawa? You have escaped my right, You shall be caught by the spear in my left. You shall die, you shall not escape."
"Pahu hou o Kakaalaneo, wehe o Kepakailiula i ka poaeae hema, komo ka ihe a paa ke kino ia ia nei, a pau ka ikaika, pahu keia i kahi hoolei lepo, e like me kela ihe mua.

Kepakailiula opened out his left elbow and allowed the spear to pass between the arm and body, when he closed his arm on it and held it there for a moment, then threw it on the dung heap after the first spear. When Kakaalaneo saw that he had again failed and having no other weapon, he turned to flee. Kepakailiula then called out: “Is the mighty one then about to flee?” With this he swung his war club Oleloikahie upwards and struck his opponent between the legs which cut him in two. Kakaalaneo with his last gasp then cried out: “Ye chiefs of Maui, are you then to see me thus die without rendering me some assistance?” At this the Maui chiefs and warriors jumped on Kepakailiula. Kepakailiula dropped his war club and met them with his hands, catching those that came near him and breaking them in two, allowing none of the chiefs to escape. The soldiers when they saw this turned and fled. Kiinoho and Kiihele then jumped ashore and entered into the fight thus making three on their side. Kepakailiula led the fight uprooting the trees and rocks on his way and rolling them onto the enemy. When Kukuipahu saw his son-in-law causing a great slaughter amongst the people he took up the young wife in his arms, ran in front of Kepakailiula and stood her up. When Kepakailiula saw it was his young wife, Kapuaokeonaona, he took her up, placed her on his back and retraced his steps, thus putting a stop to the useless slaughter of the people."
"A ike o Kukuipahu i ka luku a ka hunona i na kanaka, hopu iho la ia i ka wahine opio, holo aku la a mamua o Kepakailiula kukulu iho la. A ike aku la ia, o kahi wahine opio, o Kapuaokeonaona, lalau aku la ia a kau ae la i ke kua, hoi aku la, pau iho la ka luku ana i na kanaka. Lele mai la na kanaka o na waa, pae i uka, kalua ka puaa, ka ai, noho iho la i na hale. I aku o Kepakailiula: “Ina oukou i manao e noho i Maui nei, noho no; ina no hoi e hoi i Kohala e hoi no.” O keia holo ana, ka [ ] hoomaka ana e noho ko Kohala i Maui, nolaila, kamaaina ko Kohala poe ia Maui a hiki i keia la.","The people from the canoes then came ashore, baked the pigs and food and dwelt in the abandoned houses. Kepakailiula after calling the people together addressed them saying: “If you wish to reside on Maui do so, and if you wish to return to Hawaii [ ] you may return.” This voyage to Maui was the commencement of the exodus of the people from Kohala and they became children of the soil of Maui, even to this day."
"I aku o Kepakailiula ia Kukuipahu: “Eia ka aina, o luna, o uka o kai, o oe ke ’lii, o ka moa ko’u.” Lilo ae la o Kukuipahu ke ’lii o Maui a puni. Ua kui aku la ke kaulana o Kepakailiula a hiki i Oahu, a lohe o Kakuhihewa ke ’lii, makau iho la, no ka mea, ua make o Kakaalaneo ka mea akamai i ka o ihe, ke ’lii a Kakuhihewa i makau ai. Nolaila, lawe ae la o Kakuhihewa i ka inoa o Kepakailiula i keiki ponoi nana; olelo aku la ia i kona mau kahu: “E kii oukou i kuu keiki a lawe mai i Oahu nei, e komo i ka aina ona.”","Kepakailiula then turned to Kukuipahu and said: “Behold the land and everything in it. From the mountains to the sea it is yours. You shall be its king, only reserving to myself the rights due a conqueror.” Kukuipahu thus became the king of the whole of Maui."
"A hiki na waa i Maui, a pae ma Hana, i Kapueokahi, ninau lakou: “Auhea ke ’lii o Kepakailiula?” “Aia i kela mau halau nui.” A hiki lakou nei ilaila, ninau no. I mai o Kepakailiula: “Owau.” I aku lakou nei: “I kii mai nei makou ia oe, e holo kakou i Oahu, pela mai ko makuakane o Kakuhihewa, e komo i ka aina.” Ae mai ke ’lii, holo lakou nei; o Kepakailiula, o na wahine elua, o na makuakane elua me ka laua wahine. A hiki lakou i Oahu, a pae ma Waikiki, malaila o Kakuhihewa kahi i noho ai. Haawi mai o Kakuhihewa ia Oahu a puni, ia Kepakailiula. Hoonoho iho la ia i na makuakane i mau alii no Oahu nei; o luna, o lalo, o uka, o kai, o ka moa kona a me Kakuhihewa. Noho iho la laua he mau alii.","The tidings of this great victory of Kepakailiula were carried to Oahu, and when Kakuihewa the king heard of it, he became afraid, because Kakaalaneo the most skillful spearsman, the king greatly feared by him, had been killed by this man. Kakuhihewa therefore took the name of Kepakailiula and made him his son and told his immediate attendants: “Go and bring my son to Oahu that he may enter into his land.” Upon the arrival of the canoes at Maui and landed at Kapueokahi, Hana, the messenger asked: “Where is the chief Kepakailiula?” “In those long large houses.” When the messengers arrived at the houses indicated they again asked for the chief, Kepakailiula answered: “I am he.” The messengers replied: “We have come to take you to Oahu upon the request of your father, Kakuhihewa, that you may enter the land.” The chief consented to this and sailed for Oahu, taking with him his two wives, and his foster fathers with their wife. Upon their arrival at Oahu they landed at Waikiki, where Kakuhihewa was residing at the time. Kakuhihewa then gave the whole of Oahu over to Kepakailiula. Kepakailiula then in turn made his foster fathers the joint kings of Oahu, to have possession of everything on the land, under the land, and from the mountains to the sea, reserving to himself and Kakuhihewa their rights as rulers. The foster fathers thereupon became the joint kings [of Oahu]."
"A hala eha la o ko lakou noho ana ma Waikiki, he mea mau na na kamaaina ka heenalu i na la a pau loa. O Makolea kekahi ma keia heenalu ana, ka wahine a Kepakailiula. O ka nalu o Kalehuawehe ka nalu e hee ai o Makolea. Ia ia malaila e heenalu ana, hiki mai la o Keaumiki, a me Keauka mai Kauai mai, a lawe aku la ia Makolea lilo.","After they had been in Waikiki for about four days they joined with the people of the place in their daily pastime surf-riding. In this day’s sport Makolea, the wife of Kepakailiula also joined in with the bathers and went in surf-riding. Makolea upon joining the bathers took the surf breaking over that place known as Kalehuawehe . While she was enjoying her rides, Keaumiki and Keauka arrived from Kauai and took Makolea away with them."
"O ke ’lii o Kauai o Kaikipaananea, he ’lii ikaika i ka hakoko, i ke kulakulai, i ka honuhonu, aohe ona kanaka e hina ai, he akamai loa i ka nane, nana wale no ke eo. Aole nae ana wahine; o Keaumiki a me Keauka, he mau kiai, a kahu no hoi no Kaikipaananea. A hiki o Makolea i Kauai, lilo ae la i wahine na Kaikipaananea ke ’lii.","The king of Kauai at this time was Kaikipaananea. He was noted for his great strength in wrestling, both in the open way, catch-as-catch-can, and in the style where they get down on all fours. No man at the time was found that could throw him. He was also very skillful in giving and solving riddles; he was known to win on every occasion. He was, however, without a wife. Keaumiki and Keauka were his guardians and immediate attendants. When Makolea arrived at Kauai, she became the wife of Kaikipaananea the king."
"Haohao iho la na mea a pau loa i ka nalowale honua o ke ’lii wahine, manao iho la ua make i ka nalu, a ua lilo i ka moana loa. I aku o Kepakailiula: “Aole i make, ua lilo i ke ’lii o Kauai, ia Kaikipaananea, na Keaumiki a me Keauka i kii mai.” Noho [ ] iho la ia me Kapuaokeonaona, kahi wahine opio, akahi a launa hana laua ma ke kino. Ekolu la i hala, olelo aku o Kepakailiula ia Kakuhihewa: “I wahi waa no’u, no ka mea ke kii aihue hoi kona i ka’u wahine, pela hoi au e holo aihue aku ai.”","Upon the disappearance of Makolea the people were greatly excited and began to think that she must have been killed by the surf and carried out to sea. Kepakailiula, however, said: “No, she is not dead, she has been taken by Keaumiki and Keauka, by the order of the king of Kauai, Kaikipaananea.” He [Kepakailiula] remained with [ ] Kapuaokeonaona, the young woman, with whom he for the first time cohabited. On the third day after the disappearance of Makolea, Kepakailiula asked Kakuhihewa: “I want a small canoe. Since he has come and taken my wife in the way of a thief, I too will adopt the same course.”"

He then started off until he came to a man of note, who was very wealthy, a high chief under Kaikipaananea. When Kepakailiula met him he was taken in and made the friend of this chief. On the next day he asked his friend: “What is the cause of the shouts in that house where the people are gathered?” His friend replied: “That is our king, Kaikipaananea, he is wrestling. After that they will have a boxing match, and then they will give and answer riddles; no one can beat him, he is always the winner.” Kepakailiula again asked: “Can it be seen?” “Why not?” “Let us go there then?” When they arrived the place was packed with people. Kaikipaananea upon seeing Kepakailiula called out: “Say, will the stranger join in the wrestling matches?” “I am not versed in such sport.” “Let us box then.” At this Kepakailiula gave his consent saying: “All right, I know something of that game, but not very much. I am, however, willing to try with the son of the soil.” Upon taking their positions, Kaikipaananea after a while hit Kepakailiula which stunned him and caused him to stagger, but he did not fall. Kepakailiula then struck a blow at Kaikipaananea which knocked him down. He laid on the ground for a period of time long enough to cook an oven of food when he arose and said: “Yes, that was certainly good, you make an interesting opponent.”"
"A kokoke o Kukaea ma kahi a Kepakailiula e noho nei, kahea aku la, e hele mai. I mai ke aikane: “He kanaka ino, he pilo, o ka lepo o ke ’lii kana ai a hiki i keia la. ” I aku ke aikane: “E kahea aku oe.” A hiki o Kukaea, olelo aku la ia Kepakailiula a me ke aikane: “He kanaka ino wau, he lepo ka’u ai, he pilo wau e noho aku la.” I mai la o Kepakailiula: “E hamama ko waha.” Hamama kela, nini ka wai, pau ka pilopilo o ke kino, aahu ke kapa hou, hanai ka ai me ka io o ka puaa, ai keia a maona.

On the day following they again resorted to the king’s games where another boxing match was had in which Kaikipaananea broke an arm. At the close of the games they came home. Soon after they reached home, the king’s public crier, named Kukaea (this man lived on the filth of Kaikipaananea, never having tasted food or meat from his childhood), arrived crying: “Everybody is commanded to be at the king’s audience on the fourth day to answer the king’s riddles. No man, woman or child shall stay at home, excepting those who are unable to walk.” As Kukaea approached the house where Kepakailiula was staying, Kepakailiula called out to the public crier: “Come.” His friend spoke up: “He is a filthy man, he lives on nothing but the king’s excrement.” Kepakailiula answered: “You call him.” When Kukaea came up to them, he said: “I am a filthy man, I live on filth. I am offensive to the smell.” Kepakailiula ordered: “Open your mouth.” Kukaea opened his mouth when water was poured into it and he was requested to wash himself, then new clothes were offered him. Then food and pork were given him and he sat down and eat until he was satisfied. Then he turned to Kepakailiula and said: “What shall I give you in return for your kindness, in giving me food and meat. I have traveled around Kauai but no one ever fed me as you have done this day. Here at last I have found that food and pork are pleasant to the taste. I will pay you by giving you the answers to the king’s riddles, for no other person [ ] knows them but myself, the king’s personal attendant.” Kepakailiula then asked him: “What are his riddles and the answers to them?” “They are these:"
"“Oia ka nane mua. Eia ka haina, he hale a koe ka puka komo.","“That is the first riddle. The answer is house , reserving an opening for the doorway."
"O kanaka i ku, O kanaka i moe, O kanaka i pelupelu ia.","The men that stand, The men that lie down, The men that are folded."
"“Oia ka lua o ka nane, eia kona haina, he hale no, o ka laau e ku ana, o ka aho e moe ana, o ka mauu i pelupelu ia. E hoi au, a hiki ia la, pii ae oe, a na’u no auanei e hoa ka umu, a enaena, hai oe i ka nane mua; a ulu, a lele ke a ma kapa, hai oe i ka lua o ka nane; a pau ia na’u e lalau mai i ke ’lii a hoolei i ka umu.”","“That is the second riddle. The answer is, house , again. The timbers that stand, the battens that are laid down and the grass that is folded. I must go home now. When the day arrives, you must come up. I will prepare the oven and when it is heated you answer the first riddle; and when you see the stones thrown out onto the sides, answer the second riddle; after that I will take ahold of the king and throw him in the oven.”"

As they came in the king saw them and called out: “Let the stranger be seated here.” As soon as he sat down, the king said: “Will the stranger join in the fun?” Kepakailiula replied: “Yes.” “I have two riddles,” said the king. “If the right answers are given to them, I will be baked in the oven. If they are not answered correctly, you will be baked in the oven. These are the conditions.” The king then gave the first riddle."

It is thatched all around, reserving the door way.” “Yes, you have given the right answer to my riddle; my second one is yet to be answered. If you fail, I shall kill you.” Kepakailiula looked at the oven and when he saw the stones being thrown to the side he answered the second riddle:"
"He hale no; He laau ke ku ana, He aho ke moe ana, He mauu ke pelu ana.","It is also a house. The timbers that stand, The battens that are laid down, The grass that is folded."

Who has told you?” While he was expressing his wonder he was thrown in the oven by Kukaea. At this time, the chiefs and men of Kauai jumped in to help their king, but Kepakailiula, his friend and Kukaea fought so well and bravely [ ] that great numbers were slain, forcing the Kauai people to flee to the mountains. Makolea the wife of Kepakailiula was soon after found and they returned to the home of his friend. Upon arriving at the house, Kepakailiula gave Kauai over in charge of his friend with Kukaea under him. They then remained on Kauai for many days. Thus ends this legend. [ ]"
"O Wahanui ke ’lii, o Kilohi ke kaula, o Hawaii ka aina, holo mai la kona mau kaulua mai Hawaii mai, a Kaunolu i Lanai.

Boarding his double canoe, he left Hawaii and set sail for Kaunolu, Lanai. The reason of this journey made by Wahanui was on account of an oath made by him, “When I step on the breasts of Kane and Kanaloa, then will I return to Hawaii.” Before Wahanui sailed from Hawaii, Kane and Kanaloa, together with their younger brother Kaneapua, were living at Kaunolu, Lanai. They were three gods who sometimes changed into other forms. Kane and Kanaloa taking the form of birds, while Kaneapua very often had a human form."
"Noho iho la lakou a make i ka wai, olelo aku o Kane a me Kanaloa ia Kaneapua, ko laua pokii: “E pii oe i wai no kakou, i uka o Lanai,” o Nanaihale ka inoa o ka wai.

Upon the arrival of Kaneapua at the spring with his water jug, he urinated by the edge of the spring before he stooped down to fill his jug; he did not know that his urine had run into the spring. When he arrived home and met Kane and Kanaloa, they reached out for the water jug and each took a drink. When they had satisfied their thirst they discovered that it was urine instead of water, so they flew off and left Kaneapua on Lanai."
"Ia Kaneapua e noho ana ma ka lae o Kaunolu, holo mai ana ka waa o Wahanui, kahea aku o Kaneapua mauka: “Nowai he waa?” “No Wahanui,” pela ’ku ke kaula o Kilohi. “O Wahanui ke ’lii, owai ke kaula?” “O Kilohi.” Ninau hou o Kaneapua: “He waa e holo ana i hea?” “He waa e holo ana i Kahiki, hehihehi i ka houpo o Kane a me Kanaloa.” I aku o Kaneapua: “Pehea la hoi owau kekahi?” Olelo mai o Kilohi: “He komokomo ka waa.” “I ka iako au.” “He komo no.” “I ke ama au.” “He komo.” Pela no ka ia nei olelo a pau luna o ka waa. I aku o Kaneapua: “E hoi he ino.” I mai o Kilohi: “O oe no ka mea e hoi ai ka waa o ko’u haku?”","While Kaneapua was one day seated by the seashore on the Kaunolu point, he saw the double canoe of Wahanui passing by, so he called out from the shore: “Whose canoe is that?” “It is Wahanui’s,” replied the prophet Kilohi. “Wahanui is the chief, who is the prophet?” “Kilohi.” Kaneapua again asked: “A canoe, sailing where to?” “It is a canoe sailing to Tahiti to step on the breasts of Kane and Kanaloa.” Kaneapua called out: “Why not let me come too?” Kilohi answered: “The canoe is already loaded down.” “If the canoe is loaded down, let me ride on the sticks connecting the canoe to the outrigger.” “They are also overcrowded.” “Let me ride on the outrigger then.” “That too is overcrowded.” This conversation was carried on until every part of the canoe was requested for. Kaneapua then called after he had been denied a seat on any part of the canoe: “Return, it is going to be stormy.” Kilohi replied: “Who are you that shall cause my lord’s canoe to return?”"
"Holo mai la lakou mai Kaunolu a ka lae o Kaena, loaa i ka makani, ka ino, kahuli na waa, opili ke ’lii o Wahanui, pulu na ukana, hoi aku la a pae ma Lele, i Lahaina.

Wahanui the chief got a severe cold and the things in the canoe were wet: so they returned and landed at Lele, in Lahaina. After spending the night at this place they again set out the next day. Upon passing by Kaunolu, Kaneapua again called out as before, and again the prophet, Kilohi, refused to allow him to come aboard. Not very far from this place they again were caught in another [ ] storm and were forced to return a second time. On this return Wahanui began to realize how true the boy Kaneapua predicted and that he was much smarter than his prophet, Kilohi. On the next trip Kaneapua was given passage and the journey was then resumed. There were two sailing masters aboard, Hookele i Hilo and Hookele i Kau. Kaneapua sat behind the sailing masters. As soon as Kaneapua took his seat a thick fog was seen to approach them and before very long a thick darkness enveloped them; so thick indeed that those in the aft part of the canoe could not see those in the fore part. This darkness prevailed until they arrived at the land of Kanehunamoku, a land which appeared to them in the form of a dog. Kilohi said to Wahanui that it was a dog and begged him that they return to Hawaii and kiss the children and wives ere they be eaten up by the man-eating dog of Hina. At this it was made evident to Wahanui, that Kilohi was not the great priest that he had all along thought him to be, and that they would all have been killed if Kaneapua had not been allowed to join them."
"Olelo Hoakaka. Ua maopopo, aohe ike o Kilohi ma keia olelo ana; mai make lakou, ina aole o Kaneapua e kau pu me lakou.

Upon seeing you to be a stranger the land is hidden from view, when it becomes clear [it will be seen]. There are people on the land as you can hear their voices.” When they drew nearer to the place they saw that it was land, they also saw a man who was gathering coral for food, a death-dealing food. Soon after this they left the land of Kanehunamoku and continued on their way. After they had sailed for some time they looked up and saw two hills, Paliuli and Palikea which appeared to be moving and towering above and ahead of them. These two hills were two demi-gods sent by Kane and Kanaloa who desired their destruction. Kaneapua said to Wahanui and Kilohi: “That is death, if those hills should crumble and fall on us we shall all be killed. They have been sent by Kane and Kanaloa.” Kaneapua then called out to Paliuli and Palikea: “Return down below else I shall be killed and you two will be ashamed.” At this call the two hills were shamed and the travelers were saved. Kaneapua then said to Wahanui: “You float here while I dive down below. Honunuikuaeaea my grandmother is down there; if her back is turned up it will mean our death, but if it is turned down, we will be saved.” He then dove down and called out: “Honunuikuaeaea, turn your face upward.” She then turned her face upward and called out: “Whose offspring art thou?” “Yours.” “What is your name?” “Kaneapua.” The grandmother then fell on him and wept, and then asked him: “What is the object of this journey that brings my lord here?” “I want a rope to moor the canoe with.” She then gave Kaneapua her intestines and Kaneapua rose to the surface and tied the rope to the canoe."

The wind came up, a storm arose, the sea became rough, the waves beat down and broke over them causing the coral to be thrown up on the shore. This storm lasted ten days. When the storm abated the travelers once more thought of safety and that all their troubles were about over; but there yet remained one more object to be encountered, a dog that belonged to Kaneapua. They then landed and [ ] moored their canoe. Kaneapua then said to Wahanui: “Go until you find three men who are lying down face up; they are Kane and Kanaloa, and the third one is Mauli. Step on the breasts of all three of them and return, but don’t look backward.” Wahanui then went on his way and after carrying out the instructions he returned. Kaneapua then instructed his companions, saying: “You must now wrap me up and make me appear to be striped and say that I am your god, Kaneapua.” When Wahanui heard this he went down on his knees before Kaneapua and offered him all the things of value brought by him; this being the first time that he was made aware that this person who had been with them all this time was Kaneapua. Shortly after this all manner of spirits gathered and asked: “Where is your god?” “Here it is standing.” “Yes, you have a large god indeed.” “Yes, you could all be devoured [by him] without satisfying his hunger.”"
"Olelo aku la o Kaneapua: “Ea, i komo oukou i ka hale, mai noho oukou ma kahi maikai, he make ia, ma kahi inoino he ola ia.” Hiki aku la lakou i ka hale.

They lived here until after the expiration of some months when they made their preparation to return home. On leaving, Kaneapua gave Wahanui an image of a double-bodied giant, the bodies being joined together by means of the ribs growing into one another. It had two heads, four hands and feet and four eyes. If one was called to obey the laws of nature, the other accompanied without such desire, and so in all their movements. Upon accepting this present Kaneapua said to him: “Don’t show this image until you reach Hawaii for otherwise you will get killed.”"

[ ]","On the return voyage Wahanui first landed at Kauai, where they met a great crowd of people together with the king Kupakoili and his prophet Luluupali. Because of the shouts made by the people ashore Wahanui went ashore with his present. When the people saw this strange object they gave a mighty shout. When Kupakoili heard the shout, he inquired of his prophet, Luluupali: “How can I get possession of that image?” Luluupali answered: “Kill the king and his people and burn up the canoes.” This advice was carried out by Kupakoili, and Wahanui was killed and his image taken away. One man, however, escaped; he was one of the bailers; he dove into the sea and escaped. After a time he took unto himself a wife, a Kauai woman and settled there, taking up fishing as his occupation. It was this man’s usual custom while on his fishing trips to carry a large quantity of food along with him . After he had done this for some time his wife began to be inquisitive and at last asked him why he took so much food; he answered: “What fault is there in taking this food? Food is easily brought back again.” Shortly after this while out fishing, a storm came up and he was blown out to sea, and after a number of days he managed to land on Hawaii. When he met the people he told them that Wahanui and his followers had all been killed in Kauai, and that he was the only one who escaped. A proclamation was then issued calling the people of Hawaii to come together and to make preparations for avenging the death of [ ] their king. A double canoe was then sent to Kauai to invite Kupakoili and his people to come to Hawaii and get all the canoes and all the property on that island. The invitation was as follows: “Let no man, woman, or child remain, all must sail for Hawaii.” This invitation was accepted and all the people sailed for Hawaii where they were all killed; no one escaped.

Kaeha was the first-born, Kamano was the second, and Kaulu was the youngest of the three. Kailua in Koolau [was] their birthplace. Kaeha the oldest brother loved and esteemed Kaulu; while Kamano hated and ill-treated Kaulu the youngest of their family. Kaulu was in his mother’s womb five years before he was born; at birth he already had a full set of teeth; his hair was long, and his buttocks covered with hair."
"O ko laua kaikuaana o Kaeha, ia ia i lohe ai i ka make o Kaulu ke hanau ae, olelo aku ia ia Kamano: “Heaha ka mea e make ai ko kaua pokii?” A lohe o Kaulu i keia olelo a Kaeha, olelo iho ia i loko o ka opu: “Aia ua ola, o oe ka ko’u mea e ola ai; heaha la hoi, i ola au ia oe, alaila, malama aku au ia oe.” Hanau o Kaulu, he pauku kaula aohe kino maoli; nana ke kaikuaana huhu o Kamano, aohe kino, olelo iho ia, ina he kino kou make oe ia’u.

On hearing this Kaulu stayed in the womb. When Kaeha the oldest brother heard that the next child was to be killed, he asked Kamano: “Why should you kill the next child?” When Kaulu heard Kaeha say this he said to himself while still in the womb: “There, I see I will live. You will save me. Well and good, if you save me then I will take care of you.” When Kaulu was born he was in the form of a piece of rope, having no human form. When Kamano, the angry brother saw that it had no human form, he said: “If you had a human body I would kill you.” Kaeha on the other hand took up the piece of rope, Kaulu, and put him up on a shelf, where he remained until all of thirty days had gone by without being once looked at. Kaeha in the meantime had been carried off by the spirits and was left in a certain place in the sky, or heaven, called Lewanuu and Lewalani where Kane and Kanaloa had their home."

This shelf was used for the purpose of stowing away kapas. When he awoke he looked around the inside of the house and saw that his oldest brother Kaeha was missing. He then proceeded out of the house and looking up he saw that his brother had been carried up by the spirits to the Lewanuu and Lewalani . At this he started off in search of his brother Kaeha. Upon coming to where the heavy surf was beating he inquired of the surf: “I say, this high surf are you strong?” The surf replied: “Yes.” Kaulu asked: “What is your strength?” “I strike from above and when I catch them I give them a good soaking,” said the surf. Eight surfs then struck Kaulu, but he was not injured. Kaulu then asked of his hands: “Say, Hakaukahi my right hand and Limapaihala my left hand.” “What is it?” asked the two hands. “Flamed is the upper jaw, flamed is the lower jaw.” Kaulu then reached for the surf and broke it into small pieces, thus making the surf small unto this day. He then continued on his way until he met other [ ] demigods, the small and large waves to whom he said: “You are only making the ocean look white, you have no strength.” The waves replied: “We are strong and also brave.” A fight was then had in which he killed both of his opponents; therefore the waves are small to this day. After this he continued on his way until he met Kuililoloa, a dog that was guarding the land and the sea. Another battle was fought in which Kuililoloa was torn to pieces, therefore the dogs are small to this day."

At dusk that evening the spirits asked Kaeha: “Let us prepare some awa.” They then all got some awa and prepared the awa to be pounded. After pounding a sufficient quantity, Kaeha went out to cool himself. Upon seeing Kaeha Kaulu came out of his hiding place and met his brother. At seeing this small fellow Kaeha asked: “Who is this small boy?” “I am Kaulu, your youngest brother, whom you placed on the shelf. Because I love you I came to look for you.” Kaeha then said: “We are going to drink awa with the spirits.” Kaulu said: “Yes, tell the spirits to drink their awa first and you take yours after them. Before you drink yours offer a little to me as your god by repeating the following words: “Here is our awa.” I will then answer back: “Drink it and let me have the portion that is intoxicating.” At the close of the conference held by the two Kaulu returned to the palm leaf, while Kaeha returned to the house to join the spirits. Upon entering the house the spirits said to Kaeha: “Drink your awa first.” Kaeha replied: “No.” The spirits then drank theirs up. After the spirits had finished, Kaeha said to the spirits: “Now you be quiet until after I have taken my awa.” Kaeha then took up his cup of awa and offered up a prayer:"

Upon the arrival of Kolea and his mate in the presence of Makalii, Makalii asked them: “What do you two want?” “We have been sent by Kane and Kanaloa to ask you about the loud-voiced god that calls out at night.” Makalii replied: “That is Kaulu the youngest brother of Kaeha. He is all-powerful and strong and he is hiding in the palm leaf.”"

[ ]","Upon the return of Kolea and his mate in the presence of Kane and Kanaloa, they repeated what they had been told by Makalii. On hearing the report, the spirits went out and searched for Kaulu in the palm leaf, but could not find him. After this it became a general thing for the spirit to get intoxicated on awa. One night Kaulu brought in some large stones and placed them on the place where the spirits slept at night. In the middle of the night the spirits woke up and bumped their heads against them. The gods called to one another regarding these stones."

When Kaulu saw Kaeha going from place to place he knew what he wanted so he took Kaeha with him and flew to Manowaikeoo, a land owned by Kane and Kanaloa, where all the food belonging to the spirits was raised. The place was guarded by four men, Uweliki, Uweleka, Maalaka and Maalaki. These men watched in pairs. In the watch of Maalaka and Maalaki Kaulu and Kaeha were seen so they turned the face of the land downward causing a deep depression in the land whereby Kaulu and Kaeha fell off the land into space. When Kaulu saw that they were in trouble he called out:"
"E Kaulu-e, awa ia, E Kaulu-e, kikoo-lia. E Kaulu-e, pupuu-lia. Eha kaukahi, eha kaulua.","Say, Kaulu, turn down; Say, Kaulu, stretch out; Say, Kaulu, double up. [There are] four single ones [And] four double ones."

As soon as this was done Kaulu propped it open while he called for his brother to come out. Kaeha then came out. His hair had all fallen off making him bald headed. Kukamaulunuiakea was thereupon slain by Kaulu and its spirit flew up to heaven and it turned into the Milky Way as seen at midnight, from ancient time to the present day. Kaulu and Kaeha then returned and Kaulu vomited out the sea water. Kaeha was in front and Kaulu in the rear, as the ocean was restored. It is said that owing to this action of Kaulu the sea water became salty to this day."

So the spirits and Kaeha proceeded to where a swing was rigged up, when they remarked to Kaeha: “You take the first ride while we push the swing for you.” While this conversation was going on, Kaulu arrived and in a cunning way said: “Say, if you all wish to take a ride on the swing, I will pull the [ ] rope.” He then proceeded to instruct them how to ride the swing. “In my country we ride the swing by sitting facing one another to the full length or top of the rope; then the swing is pulled and the pleasure begins.” In this way all those spirits were killed, by the swing breaking. When the remaining spirits saw this trick played on them by Kaulu, they thought they would get even with him by again enticing Kaeha to go with them for rod-fishing. On this fishing excursion Kaeha was killed and he was put in the shell of a bitter opihi, the kind that sticks to the smooth boulders. On missing Kaeha, Kaulu went in search of him until he discovered him in an opihi; but on account of its smooth surface he was unable to get the opihi from the boulder, so he urinated on the opihi, which released Kaeha. This action caused all the opihi of this kind to become bitter to this day, and it has always been known from that day as the bitter opihi. After Kaeha was brought to life again by Kaulu they returned to live on Oahu. When they arrived at Papakolea, Moanalua, Kaulu left Kaeha at this place while he continued on his way to Kapalama in search of Haumea. Haumea was a spirit that lived at Niuhelewai, Oahu. It was a female spirit. Upon the arrival of Kaulu he found Haumea asleep. Kaulu then called: “Say, Haumea, why don’t you get up, cook your food and afterwards fight with Kaulu?” Haumea then sat up while Kaulu returned home and then flew up to Makalii who asked him: “What is it you want, Kaulu?” “I have come for the net. Give it to me so that I will be able to kill Haumea.” Makalii then gave him his nets, Maoleha and its mate. Kaulu then returned and again found Haumea asleep. Kaulu then surrounded the house with the nets, after which he called out to Haumea: “Are you to continue on sleeping? Why don’t you get up and let us fight?” Haumea then woke up and tried this way and that to get out of the house. Kaulu kept at some distance away from the house and ran around it. At seeing Kaulu running around, Haumea attempted to get after him and was entangled in the net where she was caught and killed. Kaulu then went for Kaeha and they returned to Kailua [Oahu] their birthplace where their parents were then living."
"O Lonokaeho ke ’lii o Koolau a me Kailua, nona ka lae oi o Piokeanuenue.

He had a very prominent forehead and was called Piokeanuenue. Soon after the return of Kaulu to Kailua he went to the king’s house and asked the king’s attendants: “Who is that man with the sharp forehead?” “Lonokaeho,” replied one of the attendants. They then called for Lonokaeho, saying: “Here is a youngster who is calling you names.” “What did he say?” “Who is that man with the sharp forehead?” Lonokaeho then said: “Are you strong, coming to Lonokaeho’s place in this way?” Kaulu replied: “I have a little strength but not much.” Lonokaeho’s forehead then ascended to heaven and came down again, with the idea of striking Kaulu and killing him; but Kaulu said:"
"E Kaulu e, awaa ia. E Kaulu-e, kikoo-lia. E Kaulu e, pupuu lia. Eha kaukahi, Eha kaulua. [ ]","Say, Kaulu, turn down. Say, Kaulu, stretch out. Say, Kaulu, double up. [There are] four single ones [And] four double ones. [ ]"
"Ninau ae na lima o Kaulu: “E aha la?” “O ke a luna i luna, o ke a lalo i lalo.” Paa ka lae o Lonokaeho i ka honua, ulu ka ohia, ka mauu i luna, a make iho la o Lonokaeho, ma kela puu kaulana o Olomana, e ku nei a hiki i keia la.","Kaulu’s hands then asked: “What is it?” Kaulu replied: “The upper jaw, hold it up; the lower jaw, hold it down.” Lonokaeho’s forehead was thus made fast to the ground; the ohia trees and the grass grew over him and Lonokaeho was killed on that famous hill of Olomana, which stands to this day."
"Noho iho la o Kaulu me Kaeha, a mahope make iho la o Kaeha, noho iho la o Kaulu a hoao me kana wahine, o Kekele ka inoa.

Kekele was a very handsome woman whose breath and skin were as sweet as the inamona. She was a very quiet woman. Her favorite flowers and vines were the hala, maile, ieie and all the fragrant leaves. When she retired at night she used to sleep with her hala wreaths and would wear them until they were dried up; therefore the hala at Kekele was planted for her and it grows to this day. They lived as husband and wife until their death without having any children. [ ]"

Her skin was like the covering of the young banana shoot; her eyes were like the weleweka blossom and her form was erect and faultless. Hooleipalaoa was the father, and Pili was the mother, and the land of [Hoamakeikekula’s] birth was Oioiapaiho in Kohala. Hooleipalaoa and Pili were of very high chief rank of Kohala in ancient time. Pili conceived and gave birth to a son Waikuaala by name. After he was grown up Pili again conceived and gave birth to the faultless one, Hoamakeikekula. Hoamakeikekula upon her birth was in the form of an ala (taro), and not having human form was thrown aside with a lot of sugar-cane trash by Pili the mother."

Kahea ana:","Makapailu, the mother of Pili who was a great fortune-teller, in a vision saw the spirit of Hoamakeikekula standing before her; and on being asked: “What does this beautiful young woman, whom I have not seen before, want?” Hoamakeikekula answered: “I am your granddaughter who has been thrown away by your daughter Pili. I am the younger child, next to Waikuaala, therefore I want you to come for me. I am in a pile of sugar-cane trash in the form of a taro bulb. Make haste or I shall be devoured by dogs.” When Makapailu heard this call from her grandchild, she rose and started on her journey, weeping. When Makapailu arrived at the pile of sugar-cane trash, she looked it over and lo she beheld a small rainbow in a thick fog, which moved toward her until it stood in her very presence. As she kept gazing thereon, her eyes grew dim and after a while she closed them. When she looked again she saw a taro bulb; she took it up and wrapped it in a red kapa and returned home. Upon arriving at her home, she told her husband, Hawaimake by name of what she [ ] had done. At the end of twenty days the outside covering of the package was removed and Makapailu looked and saw that the taro had changed and was in the form of a very beautiful female child, one without a blemish and very pleasant to look upon. The grandparents from this time on brought her up with great surveillance under very strict kapu. This was maintained until she was twenty years of age, without the knowledge of anybody, even her own parents. After she grew up it was her usual custom to go with her attendant in the woods to string lehua blossoms into leis, without the knowledge of any one. On their fourth day out in the woods to string wreaths of lehua, they reached a section in the thick woods, a place to them unknown where the lehua was plentiful. While they were picking the lehua there came Elepaio, the messenger of Kalamaula, the lizard king of Keawewai. Elepaio was a bird that changed at times into a human form. It called out:"
"I Waiaha ka wi, i Waiaha ka wi. Ono ka ia, ono ka ia.","The wi is at Waiaha, the wi is at Waiaha. The fish is good, the fish is good."
"I aku o Hoamakeikekula: “E, he manu hoi keia e hea nei.” I mai ke kahu: “He wi laau paha, he makani paha, e hoolohe kaua.” E kani hou ana ua wahi manu nei:","Hoamakeikekula said to her companion: “Say, there is a bird calling.” The attendant answered: “Perhaps it is the squeak of a tree rubbing one against another, or it may be the wind. Let us listen.” The bird again sang out:"
"I aku o Hoamakeikekula: “Aia hoi paha la, he manu.” Huli aku la laua e nana pono, ia laua i hoomau aku ai i ka nana, loli ae la ke ano o ka manu a lilo i kanaka.

While they continued watching the bird, it changed its form and assumed that of a human being. There stood a young man of handsome appearance who said: “My greetings to you two.” But when he saw the beauty of Hoamakeikekula he chanted and interpreted the following mele:"
"O Haili kula lehua, I wili ia e ka manu, O ka oo kani leo lea, I ka nahele o Hilo, O ka pololei kani kuamauna Ke lawe la ke awa, Kau laau o Puna.","Haili, the plain of lehua [flowers] Where the birds twine them into wreaths. The oo with its sweet note In the leafy dell of Hilo; Like the voice of the Achatinella Gathering the awa That grows on the trees in the forests of Puna."
"Ia wa, olelo aku ke kahu ia Hoamakeikekula: “E hoi kaua, ua pau ka wa kui lehua. E inoino mai auanei ka mano ou kupuna ia kaua i ka loihi loa.” Ia laua i eu mai ai e hoi, e olelo ae ana o Elepaio i ka ohu:","Upon hearing this the attendant said to Hoamakeikekula: “Let us return home; the time for stringing wreaths is ended. Your grandparents will be worried if we remain much longer. ” As they were about to return, Elepaio spoke to the fog:"
"E ka ohu kolo mai i uka E ka ohu kolo mai i kai, E kai pupuka, E kai hehena, E kai piliaiku. [ ]","Ye fog that creeps in the upland, Ye fog that creeps seaward; Ye ugly seas, ye mad seas, Ye kapu-breaking seas. [ ]"
"Ia manawa uhi ka ohu, paa ka nahele, kaawale ke kahu o Hoamakeikekula, kaawale kona haku kina ole.

In this separation Hoamakeikekula was enveloped in the thick fog and mist until she arrived at Keawewai, a place in the uplands of Kawaihae. The way was indicated by a colored cloud. At this time Kalamaula the high chief was living with his parents. Kaholeiwai was the father, Kekoolauwahineolalo was the mother and Kanaheleikaukawaokele was the sister. They were chiefs of Kawaihae at this time. Kalamaula was a handsome youth but was not in the same rank with Hoamakeikekula."
"A hiki laua nei i ka hale, ua molehulehu ahiahi iho la, komo aku la i ka hale o Kalamaula e noho nei, nana mai la lakou i keia wahine ui, nani loa.

Noho iho la o Hoamakeikekula me ka ai ole i ka ai, me ka puka ole i waho.","Upon their arrival at the house, the sun had set and darkness was approaching. They then entered the house where Kalamaula was living. When Kalamaula saw this beautiful woman coming in he greeted her; and Hoamakeikekula returned the greeting in a very low voice saying: “My greeting to you my lord.” Soon after this Elepaio related the way he found Hoamakeikekula. Then Kalamaula seized hold of Hoamakeikekula and drew her to him. Hoamakeikekula then said: “My lord don’t defile me, your maid servant, for it would be a wrong I would suffer from later in life. If you really desire that I become your wife, then allow me thirty days, possibly the response will arise within me during that time.” On hearing this reply Kalamaula was much impressed and agreed to the conditions. Hoamakeikekula remained there, but she would not touch the food placed before her, nor did she go out of the house."
"Ekolu la i hala ia ia, ike aku la ia ma ka moe uhane i keia kanaka e hele mai ana me ka newa, i ka lima akau, e paa ana olelo mai la: “Ua haawi mai ko kupunawahine ia oe na’u, a ua kakali au i loko o na la he nui lao, a ua maule wale iho kuu manao nou i ka hooko ole ia o ka haawi.

Aka, ua kau wale mai no ke ano o ka nahele ia ia.","At the end of three days, she saw in a dream a man approaching her with a war club in his right hand, who said: “Your grandmother promised me that you were to be mine and I have, therefore, waited many days for you until my spirit within me has fainted because that promise has not been fulfilled. Therefore, prepare yourself to go on a strange journey.” Hoamakeikekula replied: “I did not come here with the consent of my people, nor were my footsteps that led me here as a stranger bargained for, therefore, I shall take your words as a mantle and wear it over my shoulders at all times.”"
"Moe hou iho la ia, o ka lua ia o ka po, loaa hou ka moe, o ia mau olelo no nae. Ia wa puni ia i ke aloha i kela uhane; puoho ae la ia a uwe, puliki iho la i ke kino a paiauma.

She then tried to fathom the meaning of the dream but it was beyond her understanding. Her mind, however, seemed to dwell on the forests. On retiring the next night she again dreamed of the same person and held the same conversation. She then fell in love with the person in her dreams so much so that she woke up startled and cried. She then folded her arms, lamenting. When Kalamaula heard her weeping he asked her: “What are you weeping for? You have never done this before, not since the first day you arrived here.” Hoamakeikekula did not, however, make answer. Very early that morning just before dawn, the mountain clouds began to thicken; drops of rain began to fall one by one; the wind began to rise; the fog began to come creeping over the mamane; a rainbow appeared and stood before her. She was then entirely enveloped in a thick fog which hid everything from view."
"Lilo aku la keia i ke kula mehameha kanaka ole, a noho mauka o Pahulumoa, he aina mehameha kanaka ole; malaila ia i noho ai me ka ai ole i ka ai, o ka lehua [ ] kana mea walea o ka la e noho ai.

No loko o laila keia inoa o Hoamakeikekula, no kona noho mehameha ana.","She then rose and went out of the house and wandered over the deserted hills and plains until she arrived in the uplands of Pahulumoa, a place entirely uninhabited. She lived here without tasting food and spent her days picking and stringing lehua [ ] blossoms. At night she would retire and dream of the same person. Thus they were united in love, which became steadfast in Hoamakeikekula."
"A liuliu kona mau la ma ia wahi, loaa i kekahi kanaka huli laau hale, o Puuhue kona inoa. O kona kumu i ike ai, he ahi a i ke awakea i luna o ke kumu olapa.

After leading the life of a wanderer for some days, she was at last found by a man called Puuhue who was after some house timber. He found her in the following manner: On coming to an olapa tree he saw something bright at noon time, up in this tree. When he looked up the tree he saw a very beautiful woman hiding in the ieie vines; so he stood under the tree and called out: “Say, come down that I may fondle you and that I may speak to you.”"
"Iho iho la o Hoamakeikekula i lalo a hiki, lele aku la o Puuhue a ma ka poli wawae, honi iho la, a olelo aku la: “Pomaikai au i ko’u ike ana i kou mau maka a me kou helehelena.

When she stood on the ground, Puuhue sprang forward, lifted up and kissed the bottom of her feet and said: “I am indeed blessed in beholding your eyes and your face. I humbly beg of you that if in your goodness and beauty, I would be so fortunate as to please you my princess, that I offer you my noble lord, whose spirit you have often seen in your dreams.” This person was Puuonale, the king of Kohala, whose spirit Hoamakeikekula had so often seen in her dreams and for whom she already had a deep attachment. He was as handsome as she was beautiful, both were without blemish."
"A pau ka olelo a Puuhue, ua hoololi ia ka naau o Hoamakeikekula e ia olelo; nolaila, ua haalele ia ia Pahulumoa, a hoi pu mai la me Puuhue. A hiki laua ma Keolewa, e noho ana o Puuonale ke ’lii, a nana aku la keia, ua like me ke ano o ke kino uhane ana e ike ai ma ka moe, kulu iho la ka waimaka me ka haloiloi.","As soon as Puuhue ended, the heart of Hoamakeikekula was changed by his words, so that she left Pahulumoa and accompanied him. When they arrived at a place called Keolewa, they found Puuonale the king living there. When Hoamakeikekula looked on and saw the object of her dreams, she was unable to withhold her tears which flooded her eyes."
"Ninau mai o Puuonale: “E kuu haku, heaha ka mea i helelei iho ai kou waimaka i keia wa?” “He mea ano like me oe ka’u e uwe nei, ua launa me a’u i na la mamua aku nei, maloko o ke kino iwi ole. A no ia mea au i luuluu iho ai i ke kaumaha, a o kuu mea ia e hookaa nei i ka aie a ke aloha, he kulu waimaka.”",At seeing this Puuonale asked: “Why these tears from the eyes of my queen?” “I have seen some one like you in my dreams constantly during the past days in a form without bones for whom I am paying my debt of love with these tears; hence my sadness and tears.”
"Noonoo iho la o Puuonale a liuliu, pane aku la ia: “Pehea ke ano a me ka helehelena i kau ike.” “O kou ano a pau loa, oia kona, o kau mau olelo, oia kana, eia nae, he laau newa ma kona lima, a o ka aahu, he ahuula, a he mahiole ma kona poo.” Lalau aku la o Puuonale i ka newa, ka ahuula, ka mahiole, a waiho mai la imua o Hoamakeikekula, lalau iho la ia a honi iho la me na waimaka e hiolo ana mai na maka aku.","After pondering the matter over for a while, Puuonale asked: “Whom did he resemble?” “He looked just like you; your voice sounds just like his; he, however, carried a war club and wore a feather cape and a feather helmet.” Puuonale then took up his war club, the feather cape and helmet and placed them before Hoamakeikekula. She then took them up kissed them and wept over them."
"I kona naha ana, kui ka hekili pamaloo, lapalapa ka uwila, pio na anuenue ewalu, lana na kiowai o Kahoolana, i luna o Kahua, lalani ka ua koko ma ka moana, aaki ka ohu i na puu, uhi ka pohina hookahi anahulu, o ia na hoailona.",Puuonale then took Hoamakeikekula as his wife. At their union the thunder was heard; the lightning flashed; eight rainbows arched the heavens; the pools of Kahoolana on Kahua were flooded; red rain passed in procession on the ocean; the hills were covered with fog; and a thick mist covered the land for ten days. These were the signs [of recognition]. The two lived on happily as husband and wife.
"Noho iho la laua he kane a he wahine, a liuliu, hapai o Hoamakeikekula, a hana o Alelekinana, he kino kii, aohe keiki maoli, nolaila keia olelo: “I uka o Hookukekii, i [ ] kai o Kahua.” No keia keiki kii kela olelo, ua kaulana ia a hiki i keia la.

It did not have a human form but that of a wooden image; hence the saying: “In the upland is Hookukekii, in the lowland is Kahua.” [ ] The saying originated from this child image, and it is used to this day. This image gave the people of Kohala the idea of making idols, from which the worshiping of idols throughout Kohala in ancient time originated. The word Hoamakeikekula was also derived from the fact that Kohala is a rolling country and has plains, and because of this the people of Kohala have a fond attachment for the land of their birth. Therefore, Kohala is noted as the proud land with lonesome loving meadows. Such is the place of this legend obtained by me, which I have narrated. [ ]"

They had two children, Hookaakaaikapakaakaua a son, and Kapuaokaoheloai a daughter. Waiakea in Hilo is the country where these people lived. The brother was the first born and the sister the last. These people were of high chief rank of Hilo. These two children were brought up without knowing that they were brother and sister. They never saw each other although they lived in the same house. The brother had a male attendant and the sister a female attendant. They were brought up under a very strict kapu; they never went out of doors, not even for the calls of nature. Ku and Hina also left word with the attendants that if the brother sought the sister, then he and his attendant would be banished to Kuaihelani (a land in Tahiti), and so with the other. This manner of living was maintained for twenty years, without their seeing one another. One day the attendants as was their custom went to the uplands of Kaumana, directly above Punahoa to do farm work. After the departure of the attendants in the early morning, Kapuaokaoheloai arose and walked out of doors. Upon looking back at the house she saw a bright light within; so she again entered the house and began a search and found a door, which she opened. As she walked in she saw a red object lying on a bed. She removed the tapa from the face and saw a very handsome young man. They then slept together until the sun had passed the meridian, when she returned to her part of the house."

This conduct was kept up for ten full days. One evening Kapuaokaoheloai caught some chickens and brought them to her bed where they were concealed. That evening she and her attendant retired very early. Not very long after they had retired, Kapuaokaoheloai woke up and shook the chickens which caused the roosters to crow. She then said to her attendant: “It is daylight. It is now time for you two to go up and tend to our farm work.” The attendant replied: “How quickly daylight has come. It seems that I have just closed my eyes when I heard the cock crowing.” She woke up and went out of doors and looked up at the Milky Way which had not made its appearance: so she reentered the house and went to bed again. Kapuaokaoheloai after [ ] a while again reached for the chickens and shook them and the roosters again crowed. She woke her attendant and said: “It is daylight, the chickens are all crowing together.” Her attendant then rose and went over to the other part of the house where the male attendant was sleeping and woke him up. The two rose and started on their way to the farm lands. As soon as they left, Kapuaokaoheloai got up and went over to the other side of the house where her brother was and they slept together. When the two attendants were half way up to the farm lands, they sat down to await the approach of daylight. After waiting for some time and daylight not appearing they returned to the house and discovered their charges sleeping together. The male attendant then said to the female attendant: “I am going up to inform their parents in obedience to the instructions given us in the beginning.” The female attendant who was his wife replied: “Yes, you must go up.” When the male attendant arrived at the home of Ku and Hina, he told them of the conduct of their two charges. At this Ku gave orders to his men to go and kill the female attendant. When the men arrived they caught her to carry out the death order, but she spoke up: “Don’t kill me here, take me to the chief’s presence and there I will die. I want the chief to hear me first.” When they arrived in the presence of Ku and Hina, Ku asked the men: “Why did you save her? Why didn’t you kill her?” “She asked that after you have heard what she has to say then she will die.” Ku then asked: “What have you to say?” The attendant replied: “The chief said, that if my charge should make the first approach then I was to be banished with her to Kuaihelani. This was also your charge and command in reference to the other one of us and his charge. That is what I wish to say to the chief.” “Yes, you are right, you shall not die; you and your charge shall go to Kuaihelani.”"

[ ]","When she arrived in the presence of her charge, the double canoe was made ready and they sailed off; herself and her charge and two canoe paddlers making four of them. They sailed from Hawaii to Maui; from Maui to Oahu; from Oahu to Kauai and landed at Waimea. As they went ashore they saw a canoe on the beach from the king of Kuaihelani who was in search of a wife. When the two messengers saw Kapuaokaoheloai and her beauty, they said: “We are going to make an inspection of the whole group and if we fail to find a woman who will surpass your beauty, then we will take you as the wife for our king.” Kapuaokaoheloai and her companions, therefore, stayed at Waimea for over ten days, till the return of the messengers who reported that they had failed to find one equally as beautiful as Kapuaokaoheloai; so they embarked on their canoe and set sail for Kuaihelani. After they had been on their way for over forty days, the messengers of Kuaihelani said: “We will soon see land; we have yet, however, to smell the sweet perfume of the kiele.” After some days they caught the perfume of the kiele and soon after saw a beautiful country. The men then said to Kapuaokaoheloai: “When we reach land and arrive at the king’s house, and he should invite you to come up to him on the kapa cloth, don’t accept the invitation for it will mean death to you. If his daughter should invite you on the steps with her don’t go or it will be your death; only when they take you by the hand must you accept.” They then landed and proceeded to the place of the king. Upon seeing her the king greeted her, which greeting she returned. The king then invited her to come to him on to the kapa, this she refused. [ ]"

The name of his daughter was Kapuaokaohelo. The king desiring to know his daughter’s opinion sent word to her by a couple of birds with orders to come and look at this woman; and see if she intended making her a friend, or if she would advise him to take her as his wife."

The king’s daughter then came down and took her hand and led her up to the platform. When they were about half way up the steps, Kapuaokaoheloai slipped and fell behind; this was due to the dislike of the platform as she had lost her virginity. Her friend again reached out for her hand and led her to the top of the platform where they sat being ministered to by the birds."

When they reached the bathing pool, which was also a very sacred place, those having lost their virginity, or who were defiled, were not allowed to bathe in it, the friend said: “This my bathing pool is a very sacred place. The bathers must remove all covering before entering it.” Kapuaokaoheloai agreed to observe the rule, removed all her clothes and jumped into the water. Her friend then looked on admiringly seeing that she was indeed faultless; but detected the marks of a bite on one of her calves. The king’s daughter then climbed up the bank first when Kapuaokaoheloai followed after; but when she tried to climb the bank she slipped back , a sign that she had lost her virginity. At this her friend reached out her hand and helped her out of the water. When the king’s daughter saw the sign that her friend had lost her virginity she got angry and refused to speak to her, eat with her, or reside with her; she was so angry that she immediately sent some birds to go to her father and inform him of her discovery and to punish her with death."

If she is not of high rank then she must die.” The priests then gathered and inspected her and at the end they all agreed that her parents were not of high rank. They were of one mind with the king that she must indeed die, because she had climbed the sacred platform. There was, however, one amongst the priesthood who was not present at this time; so he was sent for by the king, to come and tell his knowledge concerning the stranger. When he arrived in the presence of the king, the king asked him: “Can you give a true interpretation concerning the rank of this woman? Whether she is of high rank or not?” The priest replied: “Yes.” The priest then continued: “She is of the highest rank and is a chiefess from the east; she is even more sacred than your daughter. The sacred platform is not for such as your daughter; it is the resting place of this one. She is far above your daughter in rank. She is none other, but is of your own blood; her mother, Hina, was the first-born and you came after. She [ ] originally belonged to Kuaihelani but moved to Hawaii where she now lives.” This saved Kapuaokaoheloai, and her friend once more joined her and lived with her as at first."

This was kept up for several nights in succession until ten full nights had passed when her friend became so much in love that she made up her mind to go in search of her lover. So one day she said to her friend: “Where abouts is your home?” “It is where the sun rises. If you should go, the first land you come to is Kauai, then Oahu, then Molokai, then Maui and then Hawaii. It is, however, at the first point where the sun comes up, called Kumukahi. The harbor Punahoa and Waianuenue is the first object to be seen upon landing. The large house which you will see in the upland is our home; my brother is still there with his attendant.” Soon after these instructions were given, her friend left Kuaihelani and set sail in her canoes until she arrived at Hilo and landed at Punahoa, where she saw a house standing in the uplands. When she arrived at the house she saw an old man sitting just within the door and a sick boy lying down. At seeing this she was puzzled, so inquired: “Is there no one else beside you two in this house?” “No, only us two.” She then returned to the beach leaving the two persons in the house."
"O keia keiki mai, o Hookaakaaikapakaakaua, ua hookii i ka ai, mai ka hele ana o ke kaikuahine a hiki i keia la; nolaila ua inoino ke kino, a wiwi loa, a ua haalele mai ka maikai i ke kino.","The sick boy was Hookaakaaikapakaakaua; he had refused to eat, from the day his sister departed from him even to this day. He therefore had grown ugly and very thin; and his once handsome face had lost its beauty."
"He mea mau i ua wahine nei, ka pii i na la ekolu e nana i keia hale, e makaikai, e ninau i ke kanaka; no keia hana, haohao ke kahu, a olelo aku i ka hanai. “E, nou paha keia wahine e makai mau nei i neia mau la ekolu, ua hoouna mai ko kaikuahine i wahine nau, e make auanei ko kaikuahine, ke hoi nele aku keia aohe kane.

As this happened for three days in succession, the old man began to grow anxious and asked his charge: “Say, I wonder if this woman is not yours who is inquiring after you these three days. I think your sister has sent her to you to be your wife. I am afraid your sister will get killed if this woman does not get the husband she is after. We must therefore coax your beauty back with food.” The attendant then proceeded and thatched a small hut and removed his charge to it; he then began to doctor him up, bathed him and fed him. At the end of two days and nights his beauty was restored and he again became as handsome as before."

[ ]","His intended wife at the end of the two days made her preparation to return to Kuaihelani; but before returning decided to make one more visit. When she was on her way up she saw a rainbow ahead of her and she also saw a thick rain cloud that was as red as blood. She then recalled the advice given her by her friend, that if she should see these things they would mean that her intended husband was there. When she arrived at the house she saw something red sleeping, so she asked the attendant: “What is that red object sleeping there?” “That is my charge who has just returned from a visit.” She then approached and uncovered him and laid down beside him. The man said: “We will not now lay together,” as his sister had forbidden it till she had lain with him. This occurring in a dream the ban was removed; in that way they came together. [ ]"

Ku was the king of Lihue at this time but had a different wife; Kaunoa also had a different husband. It was Ku’s custom to go traveling from place to place. One day while on one of his travels he saw Kaunoa bathing. At sight of her he halted on his way and looked at this beautiful woman. He was so overcome with her beauty that he approached her and asked her to be his wife while he remained in that neighborhood. To this Kaunoa assented. After they had lived together for a while, Ku believing that it was impossible for him to prolong his stay, told Kaunoa: “I am certain that you are with child. If you give birth to a boy call him Kalanimanuia, but if it should be a girl name her on your side. If, after you have brought up the child it wishes to come in search of me, here are my tokens: a loin cloth and a spear; with these things he may come until he find me.”"

She and her husband both brought up the boy until he was big and strong. Kalanimanuia was very handsome and pleasant to look upon. After he had grown into boyhood it was his custom to invite other boys to the house and give them all the food; when the father returned home and found the food all gone he would get angry and give Kalanimanuia a scolding. As Kalanimanuia continued to do this the father kept on scolding him and at times would whip the boy. One day while he was whipping the boy the mother, Kaunoa, upon hearing the boy crying, said: “Why do you whip the boy so constantly? He is not your son, he is somebody else’s son.” Upon hearing this Kalanimanuia asked his mother: “Who is my father then?” The mother denied this and said: “You have no other father, this is your own father.” The boy, however, was not satisfied with his mother’s answer and kept on asking her. This was kept up for over ten days, when Kaunoa finally said: “Yes, here are your father’s tokens, go in search of him.” She then gave him the loin cloth and the spear. Kalanimanuia then set out in search of Ku. Upon his arrival in the presence of Ku, Ku ordered his servants to seize the boy, take him to the sea and kill him; for Ku did not recognize the lad. Kalanimanuia was therefore killed and his body thrown into the sea. The exact place where Kalanimanuia was thrown was at the Kualoa point, in Koolau, Oahu. He was killed at this place."
"I ke ahiahi poeleele, lele mai la ka uhane a luna o ke ahua, olelo mai la:",Late that evening just about dusk the spirit of the boy flew up out of the water and rested on the rise above the point and called out:
"E Ku e, makua kina ino, I kau kama, Aohe nana iho o kona malo hume, Aohe kilohi iho o kana ihe, Anuanu koekoe Ka hale a ka makua e. E Kaunoa e. E Kaunoa e.

When they saw the spirit come into the temple every evening, with the voice of the child calling, they said to one another: “That must be the boy the king threw into the sea.” The old men after a time became deeply attached to the spirit of the boy; so they kept it and being priests they worshipped it. This was maintained for some days until the spirit assumed a real human form and was able to ask for its clothing and for food; so they gave him all the things they had in their possession."

Ku then began to think and after a while told the old men: “Yes, it is true that I had a son.” The old men then asked Ku: “Did you not take one to wife and when you parted from her, left with her certain things?” “Yes, I did take one Kaunoa to wife and I left with her certain things; a loin cloth and a spear.” “Then the boy you killed must have been your own son.” “Yes,” said Ku, “it must have been my own son.” Ku then inquired of the old men: “How am I to get my son?” The old men said: “Get a net, surround the house with three thicknesses and on the outside of that place a very fine net.” Late that evening the spirit of the boy returned to the temple as usual and fell asleep. While the spirit of the boy was sleeping the house was surrounded by three thicknesses of net. On the approach of day the spirit woke up and started to return to the sea. As it came out it saw that the house was surrounded by nets. The spirit then began to tear the nets. Daylight, however, found him entangled within the fine net. When the spirit was finally caught it had the form of a rat. It was then worked over until it almost assumed its human form again. A few days after this the daughter of Ku, Ihiawaawa by name, came to call on the boy, her half-brother."

After Kalanimanuia had again come back to life he asked her one day: “Which sweetheart is it that you go surf-riding with all day?” “It is Hala.” “Yes, Hala is a good enough fellow, but he has pimples on his back which make him ugly.” Ihiawaawa replied: “You are the handsome fellow having short thin hair. Kumunuiaiake is another sweetheart of mine.” “Yes, he is passable, but the fault with him is, he has only two hairs; pull them out and he will have none left which will make him look very ugly indeed.” “Aholenuimakaukai is another sweetheart of mine.” “Yes, he will appear to be very nice in the morning and in the evening he does nothing but catch flies. He is not a fit husband for you; he is ugly. Your beauty would indeed be thrown away on those ugly fellows.”"
"O keia mau olelo a pau loa a Kalanimanuia, ua olelo ia aku la ia mau kane nei ekolu, a ua lohe; nolaila, kukala lakou, e hoike i waho na maikai o lakou me Kalanimanuia.

The three then arrayed themselves in their best kapas scented with all the fragrant things and went forth to be viewed by the public. When the people saw them they gave a mighty shout."

[ ]","At daylight of the day when the public exhibition of all the sweethearts of his sister was to take place, Kalanimanuia came out on the palm of his attendant’s hand; the woods rejoiced, the winds, the earth, the rocks; rainbows appeared; colored rain-clouds moved, dry thunder pealed, lightnings flashed. When he reached the assembly where the chiefs and the people were gathered the three young men ran off ashamed. The sign of being the most handsome fellow was a suspended cord: if the cord fell to the ground of its own accord, then it was a sign that the person was the most handsome man. When Kalanimanuia approached the suspended cord, called Ahaula, it fell down without being touched. The other three were never able to do this. At this his father recognized him and everybody was permitted to come and see him. He was then made the king of Waianae. [ ]"

After they had lived together as husband and wife for some time, Hoeu left her and took unto himself another wife. Because of this, Kawaunuiaola became so overcome with sorrow, being greatly attached to Hoeu her husband, that she decided to resort to strategy in order to make him come back to her. After her husband had deserted her, she lived at their home all by herself. She then placed a kapu around her home, allowing no one to come to it and keeping herself entirely within doors: she thus lived in lonely seclusion."
"A hiki i kona wa ai, kaumaha ae la ia ia Hoeu kana kane i akua nona:","At meal time she petitioned Hoeu her husband, as her god, in the following words:"
"Eia ka ai e Hoeu, Eia ka ia, Eia ka wai, Amama ua noa,","Here is the food Hoeu, Here is the fish, Here is the water, Accept them all, they are free from restrictions."

"Ma keia olelo a Kawaunuiaola, oia wale iho no, kuhi na mea a pau loa he kane ka Kawaunuiaola, i ke kamailio mehe mea ala elua ka walaau.","In this conversation, she asked and answered the questions herself. People passing by who heard it were made to believe that Kawaunuiaola had a new husband. She also often used the following prayer:"

May the love that is beating within me fall. Say, Muki! Here is the food. The food is for Muki, The god that flies at night. Fall toward the upland, Fall toward the sea, Fall toward the froth of the ocean, Fill it to satisfy the craving within, Calling from the network within. Bind it fast The hair of the god, Not the binding that is loose and open But the binding that is tight and in a knot For the great knot that is within me is love. Paddle away! Paddle away! Like the paddling of the fishermen in the ocean, The husbandman cultivates in the field, Like the paddling of the god along the way. Oh, what must it be? Along the path trodden by you two From Kula to Hamakua. Like the game of hide and seek is the rain of Hamakua, The rain where one hides in the ti-leaf, Hide thou the object of my love there."

When those who heard her went on their way, they told others that Kawaunuiaola must have obtained a new husband. This was carried to Hoeu her husband one day in the following way: “Say, Hoeu, your wife, Kawaunuiaola acts in a very strange way; she must have obtained a new husband, for we have heard two voices talking; one in the voice of a female and the other in the voice of a man. It must be a new husband.” When Hoeu heard this from the people, he stood up and deserted the woman he was living with, the woman who enticed him away from Kawaunuiaola and he returned to his wife, at Kula. Upon his arrival at their home he asked his wife as to the rumors he had heard, which the wife denied, saying: “I have no husband, I am all alone.” They again made up and lived on as husband and wife. She was indeed cunning. [ ]"

They lived in Niolopa, Nuuanu. Kuula and his wife were great fisher folks, and they had in their possession a pearl fish-hook of great value called Kahuoi. This pearl fish-hook was in the keeping of a bird called Kamanuwai and it was kept at Kaumakapili. This pearl fish-hook was so enticing that every time Kuula went out for aku, outside of Mamala, upon seeing the hook they would jump into the canoes of their own accord. This fish was the food which this bird lived on. [ ]"
"I kekahi holo ana a Kuula i ka hi aku, i waho o Mamala, holo aku o Kipapalaulu, ke ’lii o Honolulu i ka lawaia, ike oia i ka pii o ke aku i na waa o Kuula, lawe aihue oia i ka pa, ia Kahuoi, lilo iaia, nele o Kuula i ka pa, a pololi no hoi ka manu i ka ai ole.

Upon seeing this he made up his mind to steal this fish-hook, Kahuoi, which in due time was carried out. This act not only deprived Kuula of his favorite hook, but the bird also hungered from loss of its food. Through this seizure of the pearl hook by Kipapalaulu the bird went without any food, it would fly on its roosting place and go to sleep. It was because the bird, Kamanuwai, closed its eyes from hunger was the reason why the place where it lived was called Kaumakapili, and the place is so called to this day."

At the birth of the child the parents threw it into the stream just below Kaumakapili. The water carried the child to a rock called Nahakaipuami, just below the Haaliliamanu bridge, where it is seen to this day (of writing), where it floated. Kipapalaulu was at this time living at Kapuukolo, where his palace was situated, with his daughter, Kauaelemimo by name. One day at noon she went in bathing with her maids and discovered Aiai by a large rock. Kauaelemimo took the child as her own and brought it up."
"A nui o Aiai, he keiki maikai loa ke nana aku, lawe ae la no o Kauaelemimo i kane nana, a moe iho la.

After a while she conceived a child and she began to have a longing for some fish; so Aiai went out rod fishing along the coast and after catching a few took the fish home and gave them to his wife. After the lapse of some twenty or thirty days, Kauaelemimo had a longing for aku; so she told Aiai to go out aku fishing. Aiai upon hearing his wife’s request asked her to go to her father, Kipapalaulu and ask him for a pearl fish-hook. The wife consented to this and went to her father. Upon coming in her father’s presence, he asked her: “What is it you want?” “I have come for a pearl fish-hook for my husband.” “Yes, here is a pearl fish-hook.” Kauaelemimo took it and returned to her husband. When Aiai saw the fish-hook, he said: “This pearl fish-hook is worthless, the fish will not bite it; it will weary one’s body for nothing.” The wife then asked him: “Where can I get another pearl fish-hook then?” Aiai replied: “You go to your father and tell him there is a pearl fish-hook that will enrich the fishermen. It is in the fishermen’s calabash of fishing utensils.” By this the husband wished to get possession of the pearl fish-hook Kahuoi which had been stolen from his father by Kipapalaulu."
"A hiki ke kaikamahine i mua o Kipapalaulu, nonoi aku i pa e haawi hou mai, hoole mai o Kipapalaulu: “Aohe pa i koe; o ka pau ae la no ia o na pa.” I aku o Kauaelemimo: “Ka!

[ ]","Upon coming to her father she asked for another pearl fish-hook. Kipapalaulu refused, saying: “There is none left to give; that was the last pearl fish-hook I had which I gave you.” Kauaelemimo said: “Aiai told me, you had another one; it is in the fishermen’s calabash of fishing utensils.” “Yes, certainly there is one. I now remember it for the first time.” The calabash was then brought to the king and when he looked in it he found the hook which he gave to his daughter. The wife then returned with it to her husband. Aiai took it and said: “My days of poverty are now [ ] over since you have come back.” Aiai then said to his wife: “Go back again to your father and ask him for a canoe; not one of five or eight fathoms in length, but get one that is ten fathoms in length; that is the size of the canoe that I want from your father.” When Kauaelemimo arrived in the presence of her father, she asked for the canoe described by her husband. When the canoe ten fathoms in length was brought the father asked the daughter: “Who will be able to paddle this canoe?” “My husband will.” When Aiai heard the answer made by his wife, he took the canoe and set out with the bird, Kamanuwai, taking the pearl fish-hook, Kahuoi, along. When he arrived off of Mamala he took out the hook and began fishing. The aku began to come and jump into the canoe of their own accord until it was loaded down deep. The bird then eat some of the fish and was again restored to its former self. When Aiai came home his double canoe was loaded down deep with aku. Upon arriving in the presence of his wife he gave her all the fish, but the pearl fish-hook was taken by the bird, Kamanuwai, its guardian. This is the legend of Aiai. [ ]"

After a while his master was kidnapped by Kanikaa, a spirit, so the dog went and lived with another master. It was the usual thing for the new master to go out fishing, so he took the dog with him, making it sit behind him in the canoe. Every time a fish was caught the dog would eat it up, and as the dog kept on doing this for some time, the master said: “Yes, I have no objections to your eating the fish, if you can only supply me with my favorite drink, the awa, then it would be all right for you to eat the fish.”"

In the evening the dog disappeared. This absence was because it went to steal awa down in the valley of Waipio. At this time Hakau the king was living at Waipio. He owned a large field of awa, just at the foot of the Puaahuku cliff. This was the field where Pupualenalena came and got awa. At daybreak he would reach home with his awa, when his master would take it, cut it up and prepare some and drink it. The master after this had all the awa he wanted and the dog kept him supplied for many days. The dog, however, went to the place so often that after a while very little of the field was left; so Hakau began to be suspicious and therefore set guards over the field. While the guards were watching one night, the dog came to the field and began pulling up the awa; when he had a sufficient amount for a load it took up the load and returned home. The guards then were sure that a dog was pulling the king’s awa, so they followed it. The dog being much faster than the guards it got away; but one fellow who was a good runner kept up the chase until Pupualenalena was finally tracked to Puako. When the guard saw the dog’s master he was covered with scales from the constant use of awa. The guard then approached him and asked: “Say, is this your dog?” The master replied: “Yes.” The guard then said: “You two have sinned [ ] against the king, Hakau. Your dog has been stealing the awa which belongs to the king.” The guard then took the man and his dog and brought them to Hakau in the valley of Waipio. When they arrived in the presence of Hakau, Hakau asked: “Is this your dog?” “Yes, it is mine,” answered the man. Hakau asked: “Have you been drinking my awa then?” “Yes, I have been drinking it. I thought that the awa came from some place nearer home. But I am mistaken, and that he has been getting it from Waipio, here.” Hakau replied: “Yes, I am going to kill both of you for taking my awa.”"

[ ]","During this time, in the reign of Hakau, there was a large shell used as a trumpet, called Kuana, that was owned by the spirits which lived above Waipio. This shell was blown every night and the sound from it made Hakau angry. So he said to the master of Pupualenalena: “I will, however, save you and your dog if you will get me the shell owned by the spirits.” While Hakau was speaking, Pupualenalena heard and understood the king’s wish. That night the shell was again blown by the spirits. At midnight the king of the spirits retired leaving the guards to keep watch; but later on they also fell asleep. Pupualenalena then stole in and jumped over the sleeping guards. Seeing the shell hanging over the king, it jumped over him, took the shell, stuck his head in through the loop of the string by which it was hung up and ran off with it. While in its flight and just as he was out of the house one side of the shell struck a rock and a piece of the shell was broken off. Upon hearing the crack of the shell the spirits woke up and gave chase, but they were unable to catch the dog. When the dog arrived in the presence of Hakau with the shell, he was so happy that he thereupon placed the master and his dog on a piece of land near by, and they became great favorites with Hakau.

The wise people are not all agreed as to the origin of these islands, and some have thought that they appeared or grew up from the sea. But according to the history of Hawaii, the ideas of the learned historians were entirely different from that theory. According to the traditions of Wakea and his wife Papa, these islands were the real children of this pair, being born of Papa and having Wakea for their father. Hawaii was the first child of Papa and Wakea, and some time afterwards Maui was born, and in this manner there were successive births of eleven islands. But Kahoolawe was not born of Papa and Wakea, but according to the tradition or legend of Haumea, Hina was the one who gave birth to this island and it was called Kahoolawe."

It is handed down in mele or poetic form:"

Then appeared the island, the land, The row of islands of Nuumea, The group of islands on the borders of Tahiti. Maui was born an island, a land, 2 A dwelling place for the children of Kamalalawalu. Kuluwaiea of Haumea as the husband, 3 Of Hinanuiakalana as the wife Was born Molokai, a god, a priest, The first morning light from Nuumea. Here stands the king, the heavenly one, 4 The life-giving water-drops, from Tahiti. Lanai was found, an adopted child. It was Keaukanai who had married, 5 Had married with Walinuu from Holani, [ ] The sacred albino of Uluhina. Kahoolawe was born, a foundling. Uluhina then was called upon, 6 The navel of the little one was cut, The afterbirth of the child that was thrown Into the folds of the rolling surf, The froth of the heaving sea, Then was found the loin cloth for the child. Molokini the island Is the navel string, the island is the navel string. Now stands forth Ahukinialaa, 7 A chief from the foreign land, From the gills of the fish, From the overwhelming billows of Halehalekalani. Then was born Oahu, a wohi, A wohi through Ahukinialaa . From Laakapu, who was the man, 8 From Laamealaakona a woman Who sickened of the child conception, Who sickened carrying the chief Nuupoki, At the sacred temple of Nonea During the lightning in the sacred night of Makalii. Then was born Kauai, a chief, a prince, a kingly scion Of the chiefly cluster belonging to Hawaii; Hawaii the foremost head of the islands That was spread out by Kalani. 9 The ships sailed freely to Holani, To the sacred precincts of freedom. Stand firm for the land of Kane Kanaloa, The barbed spear from Polapola, That pricked and uplifted Wanalia. Wanalia was the man 10 And Hanalaa was the woman, Of them was born Niihau, a land, an island, A land at the roots, the stem of the land. There were three children among them, Born in the same day, Niihau, Kaula, ending with Nihoa. The mother then conceived no more, No island appeared afterwards. It is Kalani who consecrates the islands, 11 Exalted in Nuumea Among the royal cluster of Kaialea. It is the conqueror who governs the islands. The thirds were joined together by Kalani; Hilo, and Puna, and Kau were thrown in. Kalani stands forth with the priest And inspected Maui of Kama. It was not long when he circuited the island Through the support given by Kalanimakahakona, The young brave that was foremost and highest, The great soldier of victories, The one who conquered Oahu, And the islands heard to their ends To the relief of Kauai through peace. All the islands were circled by Kalani, By Kalanialonoapii, From the royal stem of Haloa. Then Hawaii the island became prominent; Became prominent and victorious."

It is only the birth of the islands that is referred to and made plain by this history, tradition or recital of events, and it is well to look at the genealogy of the islands and see how they (the islands) became land according to the setting of historical events shown in the following chapter."

"“Ea mai Hawaiinuiakea, Ea mai loko mai o ka po. Puka ka moku, ka aina. Ka lalani aina o Nuumea; Ka pae aina i kukulu o Tahiti.”","“Now cometh forth Hawaiinuiakea, Appeareth out of darkness. An island, a land is born, The row of islands from Nuumea; The group of islands at the borders of Tahiti.”"

"“Hanau o Maui he moku, he aina, Na kama o Kamalalawalu e noho.”","“Maui was born an island, a land, A dwelling place for the children of Kamalalawalu.”"
"A o ka moolelo o ka loaa ana o Molokai i aina ai, ma ka nana iho i kona mau lalani mele e pili ana ia Molokai penei:",As for Molokai the birth of that island is referred to in the lines of the same song in this wise:
"“Na Kuluwaiea o Haumea he kane, Na Hinanuialana he wahine, Loaa Molokai he akua, he kahuna, He pualena no Nuumea.”","“It was Kuluwaiea of Haumea who was husband, It was Hinanuialana the wife, Then was born Molokai, a god, a priest, A yellow flower from Nuumea.”"
"Mehe mea la o Kuluwaiea he kane ia na Haumea nae, alaila moe aku, moe ia Hinanuialana, hanau o Molokai, he akua, a he kahuna.","It would seem that Kuluwaiea was a husband of Haumea, but went after Hinanuialana who conceived Molokai, a god and priest."

That is clearly shown in the mele of Kahakuikamoana in the fourth verse reading thus:"
"“Ku mai ke alii, ka lani, Ka haluku wai ea o Tahiti. Loaa o Lanai he keiki hookama.”","“Here stands the king, the heavenly one, The life-giving water-drops, from Tahiti. Lanai was found an adopted child.” [ ]"

A penei e heluhelu ai i ke mele ma ka pauku 5:","But in the tradition regarding Kahoolawe its origin is assured, it was born a foundling. Because Keaukanai was the man, he married with Walinuu, a woman from Holani, and Kahoolawe was the offspring of that union. And this is the way the mele runs in the fifth verse:"
"“Na Keaukanai i moe aku, Moe ia Walinuu o Holani, He keakea kapu no Uluhina, Hanau Kahoolawe, he lopa.”","“Keaukanai is the one who married, Married with Walinuu from Holani, The sacred semen of Uluhina. Kahoolawe was born a foundling.”"
"O ka mea kupanaha keia i ka nana ana i ka moolelo no Kahoolawe, mehe mea la no Hawaii nei o Keaukanai, a no Holani mai o Walinuu.

In the traditions of Molokini it is said, it was from the loin cloth of Uluhina, a very high chief. He was a chief who cut the navel of new born babes. And this is the legend concerning Molokini: “When Walinuu gave birth to Kahoolawe Uluhina was called upon to come and cut the navel of the child Kahoolawe, and when he came and had cut the navel he took the placenta and girt it on as a loin cloth. He then threw it into the sea and Molokini arose formed from the afterbirth of Kahoolawe and the loin cloth of Uluhina,” the very name Molokini being a contraction of the words malo and Uluhina and should read this way in the song, verse 6:"
"“Kiina aku Uluhina, Moku ka piko o ke kamaiki, Ka iewe o ke keiki i lele I komo i loko o ka ape nalu; Ka apeape kai aleale, Loaa ka malo o ke kama.

"“Ku mai Ahukinialaa, He alii mai ka nanamu; Mai ka ape o ka ia ; Mai ka ale poi pu o Halehalekalani, Loaa o Oahu, he wohi, He wohi na Ahukinialaa Na Laamealaakona he wahine.”","“Now stands forth Ahukini-a-Laa, A chief from the foreign land; From the gills of the fish; From the overwhelming billows of Halehalekalani. Then was born Oahu, a wohi, A wohi through Ahukinialaa By Laamealaakona, the wife.” [ ]"

Because Ahukinialaa lived with Laamealaakona and Oahu was born a wohi, then Laakapu lived with Laamealaakona and Kauai was born and this is how the legend runs: When Laamealaakona first had the child-sickness when conceiving Kauai, she was in the sacred house in the enclosure of the heiau (temple) of Nonea, and on a day of the month of Makalii, the day in which the lightnings flashed around this heiau, that was the day Kauai was born, and this is the king who united with the royal line of Hawaii. And this is how the legend runs in the part concerning Kauai in the mele commencing with verse 8:"
"“Na Laakapu he kane ia, Na Laamealaakona he wahine Hookauhua hoiloli, I ka Nuupoki alii, Ka heiau kapu a Nonea I kauwila i ka po kapu o Makalii, Hanau Kauai he alii, he kama, he pua alii.

Then was born Kauai, a chief, a prince, a kingly scion, Of the chiefly cluster belonging to Hawaii; The foremost head of all the islands.”"
"Ma ka nana aku i ka moolelo o Oahu me Kauai, he oiaio, me he mea la hookahi io no makuawahine o laua, no ka mea, ma ke ano o ka leo ka like ana.","So in looking over the histories of Oahu and Kauai, it is true, it seems as if they had one mother, for the voice indicates the resemblance."
"Ma ka moolelo o Niihau, o Kaula, ame Nihoa, hookahi no o lakou mau makua.

They were triplets, and with them the mother became barren. No islands were born afterwards. And the mele composed by Kahakuikamoana should read like this, in verse 10:"
"“O Wanalia ke kane, O Hanalaa ka wahine. Hanau Niihau he aina, he moku, Ekolu lakou keiki I hanau i ka la kahi. O Niihau, o Kaula, Nihoa pau mai.

There were three children of them Born in the same day; Niihau, Kaula, ending with Nihoa. The mother then conceived no more, No other island appeared afterwards.”"

But we cannot certify to the absolute truth of the story; there are several other stories very much like these, but which one is the real truth it is hard to tell. In the story or tradition of Wakea the origin of these islands is plainly told, and there are also meles reciting the doings of Wakea with regard to the peopling of these islands. One of the songs was composed by Pakui, a historian and a famous composer of songs, and he was classed among the high priests of the order of priesthood. [ ]"
"Ma ka moolelo hoi o Opuukahonua, ua oleloia i loko oia moolelo, oia na kupuna mua o Hawaii nei, he iwakalua-kumamaha hanauna mamua aku o Wakea, alaila huipu mai me ko Wakea hanauna he kanahiku-kumamalima, a i ka hui ana, he kanaiwakumamaiwa hanauna mai a Opuukahonua a hiki ia Kamehameha, alaila e hui mai mai laila mai a hiki ia Kamehameha IV he haneri kumamakahi hanauna.","In the tradition of Opuukahonua it is told in that story that they were the progenitors of Hawaii nei. There were twenty-four generations before Wakea, and as there were seventy-five generations from the time of Wakea would make ninety-nine generations from Opuukahonua to that of Kamehameha, therefore, till the reign of Kamehameha IV makes one hundred and one generations."

It is told in the history of Wakea and his wife Papa that these islands were born from them. And some of the historians believed that these islands were really made and put together by the hands of Wakea. But one of the priests, called Pakui, who was a great historian of Kamehameha’s time and a lineal descendant of historians from the very darkest ages, says “these islands were really born.” And this is how he composed his mele reciting the events which gave birth to these islands:"
"Ma keia mele e hoomaopopo ai i ka laha ana o keia mau aina e Wakea laua me Papa, e like me ka ike a Pakui ka mea nana i haku i keia mele, he kahuna ia, he kakaolelo no loko mai o ka papa mookuauhau o na kahuna nui o ka oihanakahuna.

He was a priest and a historian belonging to the board of historians and genealogist of the order of the priesthood. But in looking at Chapter I of this story the ideas of the historian are very similar in regard to the birth or appearance of these islands. Also in the song composed by Pakui in his capacity as a prophet and historian, as seen in this chapter, but it will be well to note the setting of the genealogy from the time of Wakea, as shown in the following chapter."
"“O Wakea Kahiko Luamea, o Papa hanau moku ka wahine. Hanau Tahiti-ku, Tahiti-moe, Hanau Keapapanui. Hanau Keapapalani.”","“Wakea was the old one of Luamea, and Papa giving birth to islands was the wife. Tahiti-ku of the rising sun and Tahiti-moe of the setting sun was born, The foundation stones were born And also the stones of heaven. ”"
"A nolaila o na mea mua keia i loaa i loko o ko Wakea mau la laua o Papa, a mahope o Hawaii ka hanau ana e like me malalo iho.","Therefore these were the first products of the union of Wakea and Papa; Hawaii was born afterwards, as told here below:"

Mumu was their first-born, then came Wawa, then Ahewahewa, then Lulukaina and then Kalino making five sons. Then came Mailelaulii, Mailekaluhea, Mailepakaha, Mailehaiwale and last came Kaulanapokii making five daughters. After the children were grown up, Mailelaulii asked her younger sisters, saying: “Let us go sight seeing hereabouts.” They then started out and went as far as Huehue from which point Kohala can be seen. On beholding the white sands of Kiholo and Kapalaoa they were enticed to go on. When they arrived at Kapalaoa they thought they would keep on to Kalahuipuaa. Upon arriving at Kalahuipuaa they met Puako."
"He kanaka maikai o Puako, he ui, aohe puu, aohe kee, lawe ae la ia ia Mailelaulii i wahine, a moe iho la lakou ia po a ao ae la.

When he saw Mailelaulii he took her to be his wife and that night they were covered with the same kapa. Very early the next morning the girls looked and saw Puako carrying sea water and filling pools for salt making. Upon seeing this the sisters got disgusted and said to Mailelaulii: “Say, if that is going to be your husband we will all be made weary carrying [ ] sea water for salt making and our skins will look like the windward bark of a noni tree.” Mailelaulii then said to Puako: “My sisters are urging me to continue on our way sight seeing.” Puako consented to this, so the girls departed on their way to Kohala. When they arrived at Kokoiki, in Kohala, they met Hikapoloa, the chief of Puuepa and Hukiaa; as he was a single man he took Mailelaulii to be his wife: so the sisters took up their residence in Kohala."
"A liuliu iho, holo kekahi poe o Kohala i ke kalepa ia i ke kaha, a hala loa i Kona a Holualoa, kahi o Mumu ma. O ka Mumu ma hana me na kaikaina o ka lawaia, o ke aku ka ia a me na ia e ae, a na lakou ua pa ai nei i ke aku. No laila ka ia a ka poe kalepa o Kohala i holo aku ai.","Shortly after this some of the Kohala people sailed for Kekaha and from there continued on to Holualoa, Kona, for the purpose of trade, where they met Mumu and his brothers. Mumu and his brothers were fishermen and caught aku and all other kinds of fish. They had in their possession some very rare pearl fish-hooks, which supplied them with all the aku they wanted. The Kohala traders got their fish from Mumu and his brothers."
"Hoi mai la lakou a Puuepa, lawe mai la i kekahi mau ia na Hikapoloa a me na wahine. Ninau aku la lakou: “Nohea ka oukou ia?” “No Holualoa.” “Na wai la o Holualoa?” “Na Mumu ma.” I aku lakou ia Hikapoloa: “O ko makou mau kaikunane ia, elima ko lakou nui, he poe lawaia wale no.” Olelo mai o Hikapoloa: “Pehea, loaa no ia’u ka pa ke kii?” “Ae, aole e aua ia oe, ke olelo aku oe he kaikoeke oe no lakou, a ke hai aku oe o Mailelaulii kau wahine.”","On returning to Kohala the traders upon arriving at Puuepa took some of the fish to Hikapoloa, his wife and sisters. When the fish was given to them the sisters asked: “Where did you get your fish from?” “From Holualoa.” “From whom at Holualoa?” “From Mumu and his brothers.” The sisters then said to Hikapoloa: “They are our brothers. There are five of them and all fishermen.” Hikapoloa then asked: “Do you think I will be able to get a pearl fish-hook if I should go for one?” “Yes, they will not refuse you one if you tell them that you are their brother-in-law and if you tell them that Mailelaulii is your wife.”"
"Holo aku la o Hikapoloa a pae ma Holualoa, i ka lawaia na kaikoeke a hoi mai la, e noho ana keia i ka hale. Hai aku la o Hikapoloa i na kaikoeke, e like me ka olelo a na kaikuahine.

Upon his arrival his brothers-in-law were out fishing so he awaited for their return. Upon being told that he was their brother-in-law, they asked him: “What is the object of your visit?” “I have come for a pearl fish-hook for aku fishing. That is the only thing that has brought me here, nothing else.” “Yes, you shall have a pearl fish-hook. Here it is, with the rod and line.” When Hikapoloa came home his canoes were loaded down with dry aku as well as with fresh aku."
"Hai mai la o Hikapoloa a hiki i Kohala, noho iho la a liuliu, hoolale aku la i na waa a me na kaohi.

When the canoes were ready they started out and upon coming to the aku grounds he took up the fish-hook and held it in his hand, thinking that the aku would jump into the canoe of their own accord. He held the hook this way all day until the paddlers were stiff with cold, but no aku was caught. Upon failing to get any aku he took it as sufficient cause for the death of his brothers-in-law. When they arrived home, Hikapoloa did not tell his wife of his plans to kill his brothers-in-law; but he told the watchman at Kukuipahu, the place where the canoes from Kona generally make their landing, saying: “In case my brothers-in-law from Kona should arrive, don’t give them any food; tell them they can get their food up at Hikapoloa’s place.” Hikapoloa then prepared firewood and the umu, and then selected a guard for the door who was already armed with a stone axe and instructed him that when any head should enter the door to cut it off."

After a while there was no food to be had in the district; Kohala was the only [ ] place that had food, so Kalino said to his older brothers: “Let us sail to Kohala and get us some food.” The brothers consented to this; so they made ready and while on their way they fished for aku. When they arrived at Kukuipahu, in Kohala, their canoe was loaded down deep with aku. As they came ashore they were all faint with hunger from want of food; so they went to the house of the watchman expecting to obtain some food. When they arrived at the house the watchman said: “Your brother-in-law has left word that you go right on up as he has the food for you.” The younger brothers then said to Mumu: “You go on up and when you get there bring us some food. After we have some food we will also go up. Don’t be long.” Mumu then took up an aku and started on his way to Puuiki, a hill looking down on Kukuipahu and from which point the houses of Hikapoloa could be seen. As he reached the top of the hill, the watchman called out to Hikapoloa: “Say, I see a man, he comes running with a fish in his hand.” Hikapoloa looked and saw it was Mumu, so he said: “It is the brother of Mailelaulii.” When Mumu arrived outside of the enclosure surrounding the house, he asked of the watchman: “Where are the chiefesses?” The watchman said: “That is afterwards; enter the house and have some food first, then you may see your relations.” On thus being invited, Mumu entered the enclosure and went up to the house. The inner guard then called out: “Come in.” At this Mumu entered, head first, when down came the axe and the head was cut off from the body. The head rolled off to some distance and then asked:"
"E ui aku, e ninau, I ka hala i make ai ke kanaka; Heaha ka hala o kanaka i make ai?",Inquire and ask For the fault why the man was killed; What is the fault that a man should be killed?
"I aku o Hikapoloa: “He hala. O ka pa ai ole, haawi ia mai, o ka pa ai, aua ia aku. Oia ka hala.” Pane hou mai ke poo o Mumu ia Hikapoloa:",Hikapoloa answered: “There is a fault. The pearl fish-hook that was worthless was given to me and the pearl fish-hook that the aku is fond of was kept back. That is the fault.” The head of Mumu again inquired of Hikapoloa:
"Ua makaukau ka umu, ua enaena; ia wa, kalua ia ke kino o Mumu i ka umu, a moa, olelo o Hikapoloa: “O ka mea ikaika i ka ai ana, e lilo ke ahupuaa nui iaia.

After it was cooked Hikapoloa said: “The person who will eat the biggest amount shall be presented with the largest ahupuaa.” After the body was eaten the bones were thrown onto a pile of sugar-cane trash. The younger brothers in the meantime awaited for the return of their brother. After some time had lapsed Ahewahewa went up and he also was killed. The next one followed and so on down to Kalino. When it came to Kalino’s turn, he took up an aku and started off. When he got to Puuiki, he was seen, and the watchman called out to Hikapoloa: “Say, there is a thin man coming up.” Hikapoloa answered: “It must be Kalino; he must be coming up sideways for he is a large man. He is the last one, the youngest of the brothers.” When Kalino arrived with the aku in his hand, he asked the watchman: “Where are the chiefesses?” “You can see them later on, enter first and help yourself to some food, then afterwards go and see them.” Kalino then entered the house, when down came the axe and his head was cut off. The head of Kalino then asked:"
"I aku o Hikapoloa: “He hala. O ka pa ai ole, haawi ia mai, o ka pa ai, aua ia aku, oia ka hala i make ai.” Olelo mai ke poo o Kalino:",Hikapoloa answered: “There is a fault. The pearl fish-hook that was worthless was given to me and the pearl fish-hook that the aku is fond of was kept back. That is the fault why he should be killed.” The head of Kalino then answered:
"Kalua ia o Kalino a moa i ka umu, ai ia iho la, a koe ka iwi kiola ia i waho o ke opu ahuawa.",Kalino’s body was then cooked in the umu and was then eaten up; and the bones were thrown in a heap of ahuawa.
"Elima lakou nei, elima umu, elima wahie, eia na wahie.","There were five brothers, requiring five umus and five different kinds of firewood:"
"O Mumu, ke kanaka, he opiko kona wahie; O Wawa, ke kanaka, he aaka kona wahie, O Ahewahewa, ke kanaka, he mamane kona wahie. O Lulukaina, ke kanaka, he pua kona wahie.

They were closed up in another house, never once coming out; as people while composing a name chant were restricted and not allowed to go in and out of the house. But Kaulanapokii, the youngest of the sisters, saw the spirits of their brothers standing without heads; five bodies headless, whereupon she wept and walked back and forth within the house. Kaulanapokii was a woman who had supernatural powers and could see certain things. This power is even now possessed by the doctors who give medicines in her name."
"E olelo iki kakou no Kaulanapokii. He wahine mana o Kaulanapokii, he ike; o ia mana a hiki i keia la, a ke lilo nei oia i kumu lapaau, a haha paaoao.

We are composing a chant, but you are walking back and forth.” Kaulanapokii replied: “Our brothers have all been killed by your husband, for I see all five of them standing without heads. ” The sisters then all began weeping for their brothers, but Kaulanapokii stopped them saying: “Don’t weep.” Kaulanapokii then told her sister Mailelaulii: “Sit down and force the child to come forth at this time, so that your husband upon hearing the child will come in here, when he shall be killed.” Through the supernatural powers of Kaulanapokii, the child came forth although the time for its delivery was not yet come. This was caused through the anger of Kaulanapokii. As the child came forth, Kaulanapokii took it by the feet and held the child up, at the same time calling to Hikapoloa: “Come and get your child.” Hikapoloa then came into the house. As he entered, Kaulanapokii called out to her sisters:"
"E, Mailelaulii, Mailekaluhea, Mailepakaha, Mailehaiwale, E ke ie! E ka mana wai, E kahihi kua, e kahihi alo.

The rain beat down in torrents, the wind blew in a gale and the fog and mist covered the land. This prevented Hikapoloa from getting out, as the ie and maile had entangled the whole house. Upon seeing this the priest, Kehoni by name, who had entered with Hikapoloa, called out:"
E Kaulanapokii e! Ka wahine mana o ka la komo Ka ulu loaa ole i ka lou ia No’u kekahi ola.,"Say, Kaulanapokii, The all-powerful woman from the eastern sun, The breadfruit that cannot be reached with a pole, Allow me a pathway."

Hikapoloa died and the house was set on fire. Kaulanapokii then proceeded to the place where her brothers had been killed and called in a chant:"
Ka uwahi opiko o uka e aala mai nei e! Ua ike paha oe i kuu kaikunane o Mumu.,"Say, thou smoke of the opiko send your fragrance from the uplands, Perchance you have seen my brother Mumu?"
"“Ae, ua ike, aia i ka puainako na iwi.” Hele aku la keia ohi, houluulu a kahi hookahi, pela no ka ia nei hana a hiki ia Kalino, oia ka lima:","“Yes, I have seen him, his bones are lying there on the pile of sugar-cane trash.” Kaulanapokii then proceeded to the rubbish pile and collected the bones together. She then called each brother in turn collecting their bones together until it was the turn of her fifth brother, Kalino, when she called:"
Ka uwahi alani o uka e aala mai nei e! O ka wahie paha oe o kuu kaikunane i moa ai.,"Say, thou smoke of the alani, send your fragrance from the uplands, Are you not the wood with which my brother was cooked?"

He has been consumed and the bones are there in the ahuawa heap where they now lie.” Kaulanapokii proceeded to the place indicated and collected them. After all the bones had been collected, Kaulanapokii said to her sisters: “Let us work on our brothers and when they come to life again we will return to Kona.” The sisters then first took up Mumu and after he came back to life the others were taken up. After all the brothers had been restored to life, they all returned to Kona, where they all made oath, that they would never be covered over with the same kapa with any man or woman from Kohala. This oath was even taken up and kept by their children after them. Thus did they forsake the proud land of Kohala and its favorite wind, the aeloa. [ ]"

When he first came to the place there was no food growing, no taro, no potatoes, no yams, nor anything else in the shape of food. All the food had been taken and hidden by the gods in Kalae, Kau. Once upon a time Pupuhuluena had a desire to go fishing, so he sailed to a point directly off Makaukiu. While he was busy fishing, he saw that all the different fishes were gathered under his canoe; the uhu, the nenue, ulua, kahala, opakapaka, hee, manini, opelu, aku and all the other kinds of fishes. When he saw the fish move away he followed them until the cliffs were passed, and as the fish kept on going he followed right along; he arrived off Kohala, still the fish kept on: he arrived off Kawaihae, still the fish kept on: then on to Puako and to Maniniowali where the manini remained behind, but he still followed until he was off Kekaha and from there on to Kaelehuluhulu; here the aku and opakapaka remained behind. Proceeding again until he was off the Kona coast, here some of the other fishes remained behind, but he kept on following the others until he was off the place called Kapukaulua, just this side of Kalae where the ulua remained behind. At this place he saw a canoe floating with a large-mouth net let down on the coral bed. There were two fishermen in the canoe, Ieiea and Poopalu; they were the fishermen of Makalii."
"Nana aku la o Pupuhuluena, e lana ana keia waa lawaia, he upena waha nui ka upena e kuu ana. O ka inoa o keia mau lawaia, o Ieiea, o Poopalu, he mau lawaia na Makalii.

He then took up a kukui nut, chewed it up and blew the substance upon the surface of the sea which enabled him to clearly see the bottom. As he looked down he saw the fish entering the mouth of the net, let down by Ieiea and Poopalu, so he called out: “Say, the fish have gone into your net.” “You are telling a lie. We are looking down and we don’t see any fish going in.” The reason why Ieiea and Poopalu did not see the fish was because they were chewing the sea-bean (mohihi) and blowing the juice on the surface of the sea which did not render the sea smooth, so they were unable to see the bottom very clearly. The place where they had their net was not very deep. Pupuhuluena, however, kept on calling to haul up the net till at last Ieiea and Poopalu thought they would haul up the net, when to their surprise they discovered it was full of fish. When Ieiea and Poopalu saw that Pupuhuluena had something they did not have they requested some kukui nut; so Pupuhuluena gave some of his nuts to the fishermen and they threw away their sea-beans. These two fishermen kept some of the nuts and when they arrived home they planted some. This is how the kukui was first introduced into the districts of Kona and Kau."
"Haawi mai la o Poopalu i ka ai, he kalo moa, he uala, lalau aku la keia a ho-o i ka hokeo. Ninau mai o Poopalu: “I mea aha ia au, e waiho nei i ka hokeo?” I aku o [ ] Pupuhuluena: “I mea kanu.” Olelo mai o Poopalu: “Aole e ulu, ua moa, no ka mea, aia no i ke akua ka ai, a me na mea a pau, aia a moa loaa mai ia maua ka ai.

A loaa ke kii me ka hinai ie, olelo mai o Poopalu ia Pupuhuluena: “O ke kii mahope ou i luna o ka waa, a owau iloko o ka hinai, e holo kaua i ka aina o ke ’kua.”","Poopalu then gave Pupuhuluena some kalo and potatoes already cooked. Pupuhuluena took them and placed them in his calabash. At this Poopalu asked him: “Why do you put them in the calabash?” Pupuhuluena replied: “To save them for planting.” [ ] Poopalu said: “They will not grow as they are already cooked. The gods have charge of the food and all else, and we can only get it after it is cooked. If you wish to get some for the purpose of planting then obey this instruction: You must first hew out an image from a wiliwili tree and then braid a basket of ie.” Pupuhuluena then consented to do this. After the image and basket were made, Poopalu said to Pupuhuluena: “Place the image behind you on the canoe while I will get into the basket and then we will sail to the land of the gods.”"

Poopalu, however, instructed Pupuhuluena from within the basket to say: “That is a refuse heap; here is the landing place where the surf is breaking, for I am a native son of this place.” When the gods heard Pupuhuluena, they remarked amongst themselves: “He is a native son of the soil and not a stranger.” The regular landing place then became calm while the rough sea went back to the place opposite the refuse heap. As Pupuhuluena went ashore, the gods came down to help him lift the canoe. At this Pupuhuluena said: “The stern of my canoe is kapued. I will lift that part myself while you can lift the forward part.” After the canoe was carried ashore, the gods brought all the different kinds of tubers and showed them to Pupuhuluena, saying:"
"Pupuhuluena, Kapala, Kapakio, Heaha nei ai ia oe la?","Pupuhuluena, Kapala, Kapakio, What kind of food is this?"
"Olelo ae o Poopalu i loko o ka hinai: “E olelo aku oe, he hoi, he ai make,” pela ke aoao ana a lohe a Pupuhuluena, kahea aku o Pupuhuluena:","Poopalu spoke from within the basket: “Tell them it is a Hoi, it is poisonous.” So Pupuhuluena chanted back:"

One day to dig it, One day to stand it in water, One day to render it sweet, One day to warm it in the sun. But with all that, the children will die from eating it. It has sprouted, it is growing over yonder."
"Hoike hou ke ’kua, he uhi ia ai: “Heaha nei ai ia oe e Pupuhuluena?”","The gods then brought out another tuber and asked: “What is this food called, Pupuhuluena?”"
"He uhi he ai ola, Kii aku no kalua A moa, ola ka wahine.","It is a yam, it is a life-giving food, Go for it and bake it. When cooked, your wife is then sustained."

While playing in a certain game, Pupuhuluena took some of the gods and stood them up on their heads. This action so shamed them that they gave Pupuhuluena each of the different tubers. Pupuhuluena then returned to Kohala and planted the yam, and yam can be found at the bottom of the cliffs to the east of Kohala to this day; also the kalo, potatoes, gourds, and all the different tubers. It was Pupuhuluena who first introduced them into Kohala. [ ]"

Pueonuiokona was the king of Kauai at this time. Because of this death of Halepaki, Kaipalaoa took up the profession of wrangling or disputation. Wailea, his mother, was skilled in the profession and so took the education of her son upon herself until all she knew had been imparted to the boy. She then said to him: “Go to your aunt who lives in Kohala, the wife of Kukuipahu, Kalenaihaleauau by name. She will complete your education.”"

She taught him all she knew relating to the profession: the things above and the things below, in the uplands and in the lowlands; the things that happen by day and the things that happen by night; of death and of life; of good and of evil. She taught him all that she knew, whereupon he was classed as an expert, and soon after arose and went in search of his father. He took along with him a calabash in which were stored all the things relating to his profession and proceeded to the sea coast where a canoe was lying. He took the canoe and started on his journey, first landing at Keoneoio at Honuaula where he spent the night. Early the next morning he again boarded his canoe and set sail landing at Kaunolu, Lanai. From this place he again set sail and landed at Kalaau Point, near Kaunakakai, Molokai, where he stayed over night. On the next day he left Molokai and set sail for Oahu, landing at Hanauma where he left his canoe and proceeded overland; he first stopped at Kaimuki, then at Niuhelewai, where he took a bath, then continued on his way till he came to Pokai, in Waianae, where he spent the night. When he woke up the next morning he saw the canoes of Pueonuiokona, from Kauai, preparing for their return, so he proceeded to the landing place and asked of the men that he be allowed to accompany them to Kauai. At this request the men said: “Be off, you shameless youngster , you shall not take passage in the king’s canoes.” When the king heard his men talking he called out: “Young man, come here to me.” When the boy stood in the presence of the king, the king asked him: “What [ ] were you saying to the men?” “ I was asking them that I be allowed passage on the canoes to Kauai; but they told me that the canoes belonged to the king.” Pueonuiokona then said: “You may take passage in one of them. Have you any baggage to take along?” The boy answered: “No, except that I have a calabash of clothes. ” “Well, get it and come here and we will sail.”"

Taking his calabash he proceeded to the landing and took one of the canoes that were lying there and set out for Kauai. The king, accompanied by his men, got to the landing and waited for the boy until noon, but as he did not appear the canoes were ordered to sail. When Kauai was seen, those with the king saw something floating ahead of them, and when they drew nearer to the object they saw it was a canoe with the boy in it. The king then called out to the boy: “I see that you came ahead of us and we wasted our time waiting for you.” “Yes, I thought that the king’s canoes were already overloaded with bulky things and with big men and large packages, so I made up my mind to come ahead in the dark with the idea, however, of being overtaken by you here in mid-ocean.” A rope was then thrown to the boy which he made fast to his canoe and he was towed on until they landed in Hanalei, Kauai."

At seeing this the boy asked the king: “Oh king, let me have some fish.” The king answered: “Take one of the canoes of fish for you.” The boy, however, reached down and only took up two fish, one was an oililepa and the other a kikakapu. The king then asked the boy: “Are those the only fish you are going to take?” “These are all the fish I am going to take as they are the kind that will cook quickly.” Soon after this the boy left Hanalei and proceeded on his way, going by way of Koolau until he arrived at Waiakalua where he rested. From this place he continued on to Anahola; thence on to Kealia and then on to Wailua where Kalanialiiloa resided, where was his bone fence, almost completed, built from human bones. When he arrived at the place he looked and saw the bones of Halepaki his father; they were still fresh, the bones not yet being bleached. At sight of this the boy bowed in sorrow and wept. After his weeping he approached the flagstaff and pushed it down and put up the oililepa, one of the fish brought along by him. He then next took the kapu stick and pushed it down and put up in its place the other fish, the kikakapu. By this action of the boy, it was meant as a challenge to the people that he was come to meet them in a wrangling contest. When Kalanialiiloa and his instructors saw the action of the boy, they knew at once that he was challenging them to a contest of wits, so a messenger was dispatched to meet the boy showing the challenge was accepted."

Upon hearing this the chief said: “Go down again and if he asks you to go down, say yes to it. When you proceed to go down, he will then come up here.” The man again returned to the boy and called out: “Young contestant, the chief invites you to come on up.” The boy replied: “Full-grown contestant, the chief invites you to come on down.” The man then proceeded on down and the boy went on up to the chief’s place."

You shall remain there and die there. For die you must, young man, for you cannot come in here.” The boy saw at once that no time would be wasted by the Kauai people nor would they allow him time to prepare himself although he knew that that was a part of the profession; but they did not, however, find him unprepared, the boy immediately replied: “You must then remain in there, you full-grown men until you die. Eat up what food you have, obey the calls of nature, and eat, you must die within for you cannot come out.” At this Kalanialiiloa spoke up: “The boy is indeed right. He is on the outside where he can sleep and get up and can go where he pleases; whereas we are huddled up in here, and after we have eaten up our food and fish and have drunk up our water we will not be able to get any more as we cannot go out. We will, therefore, remain in here until we die. It is, therefore, best that we befriend the boy and allow him to enter.” The instructors, however, refused to allow this. In this both sides came out even. The men had intended to best the boy in their battle of witty remarks when the boy would have been killed."

They then poured water on the dirt and made mud, making it unfit for any person to sit down on. They then called for the boy, saying: “You will surely die now for we have taken up all the covering from the floor leaving it bare.” The boy then entered the house and looked down at the lowest battens, which were next to the ground and then addressed his calabash: “Say, you must sit down here on this part of the floor where it has a covering.” At this the men said: “You are a deceiving young man, there is no covering left on the floor, for we have taken it all up.” The boy replied: “When the framework of this house was put up the battens were put on, beginning with the lowest one called the bottom covering. If so, then why can not I call it a covering.” “And why not? It is a covering because it is laid at the bottom, and furthermore the rest of the battens are fastened above that one,” said the chief. The men said: “The boy may have beaten us in that, but he will never find this our next move.” The men then spread out makaloa grass on the floor, then their Niihau mats over the grass, then took out their kapas made on Kauai and laid them down, saying: “Die you must, young man, for we have taken everything and left you nothing.” At this the boy reached for his calabash, uncovered it, reached in [ ] and took out some kuolohia grass and spread it out, then took out a mat, then a covering made from fragrant hala blossoms of Puna and spread it out, then an ouholowai kapa robe, of Olaa, all strongly scented with the olapa."

The men then said: “He may have all these things, but he will not have anything to show in our next move, when he will surely be killed.” The men then ordered that they prepare wood for the umu, start the fire and strangle the pig; and when the pig was cooked to drink awa. Both sides then started to carry this out and to see which side would drink awa first. The boy then reached for the calabash, took out some wood already split up into small pieces and tied up into a bundle, took off the string and let the wood fall out; he next reached for a small bundle of pebbles, to serve as stones for his umu, placed them on the wood and started the fire; he next reached for a piece of kukui wood, called puaa, which was made into the shape of a pig; he next reached for the cord and proceeded to wind it around one end of the piece of wood. At the process of winding the string, a squeaking noise was heard, to which the boy said: “What a squeaking pig this is.” He then placed it on the umu and peeled off the bark leaving the white wood exposed; the next thing was to cut it open which he did and took out a piece of pork and portions of the offal of a pig, which had already been wrapped up in this piece of wood, and he then went through the act of cooking it in the umu. After the supposed pig was put in the umu, he reached for a few pieces of umu covering from his calabash and covered up the umu."

After the pigs were cooked the others proceeded to cut up a real pig, while the boy took out his piece of pork from within the kukui wood and began his meal, first drinking his awa. When the boy finished his meal his head bowed down being overcome by the effects of the awa."

The men began reciting their verses with certain of their number sitting in the rear of the reciters going through certain motions. When it came to the boy’s turn, he placed a wooden image behind him and began his recital. At this the men said: “It is indeed strange that you should have a wooden image to make the motions for you, while we had those who could talk and recite with those who chanted.” The boy replied: “You are all wrong. All great and noted chanters while reciting verses are always accompanied by those who make the motions in silence; the only voice to be heard is from the one doing the reciting.

It was Laukiamanuikahiki’s custom to bring in other children to their home and give them all the food; which action caused her father to get angry and very often punished her. This punishment was kept up by the father for some time. Because of this, the child suspected that this man could not be her own father; so she began questioning her mother who her own father was until the mother could bear it no longer. Hina then said to Laukiamanuikahiki: “You go to that cliff; that is your father.” Upon coming to the cliff, she asked: “Are you my father?” The cliff denied this saying: “I am not your father.” The child returned to Hina and begged: “Tell me of my father.” “Yes, you go to that bambu bush, that is your father.” When she arrived at the place, she asked the bambu bush: “Are you my father?” “I am not your father, Makiioeoe is your father, he has gone back to Kuaihelani.” When Laukiamanuikahiki again arrived in the presence of her mother she said: “You have deceived me. Makiioeoe I understand is my father and he has gone back to Kuaihelani. You have hidden this from me.” “Yes, he is your father, and he has left word that you must not come to him without a sign or you will have a terrible suffering. You have to go to him in a red canoe having red sails, red cords, red men and must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men.” Laukiamanuikahiki [ ] replied: “I am not going to remain, I am going in search of my father.” “Yes, you may go, but you will have to suffer untold agony. Go until you come to two old women roasting bananas by the wayside. They are your grandmothers, for they are my own mother and aunt. Reach down and take away the bananas and let them search for them until they ask whose offspring you are, then tell them, ‘Your own.’ ‘Ours from whom?’ ‘From Hina.’ Then when they ask you, ‘What brings you our lord here to us?’ Tell them, ‘I want a roadway.’ ”"

At the conclusion the old women said: “There is a roadway; here it is, a bambu stalk. You climb to the top of it and when it leans over it will reach Kuaihelani.” Laukiamanuikahiki then climbed to the top of the bambu stalk and sat there. The bambu then began to shoot up and when it had reached a great distance it leaned over until the end reached Kuaihelani. Laukiamanuikahiki stepped off the bambu and proceeded along the road until she met a girl whom she took as a friend. They then went along until they came to a flower garden. The flowers of this garden were all kapu; none were to string them into wreaths until they shall have been picked by the daughter of Makiioeoe; the flowers of the ilima, the marigold and other flowers and also the maile vine. There were guards in the garden who were watching the flowers. Laukiamanuikahiki, however, reached out and picked the flowers, took the maile vines and broke them off. When they came to the pool of water, which had been kapued until it was first used by the daughter of Makiioeoe, Laukiamanuikahiki uncovered herself and plunged into the pool of water, when a turtle came up to her and began rubbing her back . After she finished bathing she went up on the bank. When the guards saw what she had done, they said: “You are indeed a strange girl bathing in the pool of water which is kapued and reserved only for the king’s daughter. You will indeed die.” When the guards arrived in the presence of Makiioeoe, they told him of all the girl’s doings. Makiioeoe then ordered that wood be prepared for the girl and to pack it to the seashore where the umu was to be started the next day, for on that day the girl was to be killed. The guards then returned, took the girl by the hands, bound them at her back and led her to the pig house where she was tied, the guards standing watch over her that night. That night her friend came and asked that she too be bound; but Laukiamanuikahiki said: “No, you must be at liberty so as to bring me food, meat and clothing.” Her friend consented to this."

This owl was the supernatural aunt of Hina, who had come all the way from Kauai because she knew of the coming peril of her grandchild, and who had in its keeping the tokens that had been given by Makiioeoe to Hina by the means of which she was to be known or recognized upon her arrival at Kuaihelani.

He then broke into the house , took up his daughter and wept over her. After the guards had departed to inform the king, the owl flew down and clapped its wings on the girl, placed the necklace of whale’s teeth around the girl’s neck, girded [ ] a pa-u around her waist and placed the feather cloak over her. These being the tokens left by Makiioeoe in the keeping of Hina. After it had become broad daylight, Makiioeoe ordered that the umu be started; when it was sufficiently heated the people who had ill-used the girl were then thrown into the umu and they all perished. The girl who befriended Laukiamanuikahiki was made a high chiefess and she lived with Laukiamanuikahiki. Soon after this a kapu was placed over Laukiamanuikahiki and she was forbidden from going out of her living house and no one was allowed to pass by her house or to speak to her. Laukiamanuikahiki was a very beautiful woman to behold and she had no equal in all the land of Kuaihelani, for her beauty could be seen on the outside of the house, like a bright light."

This young man was married to Kahalaokolepuupuu of Kahikiku and had come to Kuaihelani without his wife on a visit to his parents. When Kahikiula arrived he was accompanied by his followers in a red canoe, with red sails, red cords, red paddles, red men, large canoes, small canoes, large men and small men. Upon the arrival of Kahikiula at Kuaihelani he was met by his mother and father and all the people. Soon after this Makiioeoe requested Kahikiula to go and meet his sister, Laukiamanuikahiki, which invitation was accepted. When they were near the house, Kahikiula looked and saw a bright light on the outside of the house; so he said to Makiioeoe: “Say, your house is on fire!” Makiioeoe replied: “That is not a fire, it is some person sleeping within, it is your sister.” They then entered the house and Makiioeoe approached the bed and roused his daughter saying: “Wake up, here is your brother Kahikiula.” Laukiamanuikahiki awoke from her sleep and turned down on her breast. She then looked up at Kahikiula and greeted him. What a sight it was to behold these two; one was as handsome as the other was beautiful; both were equal in good looks, Kahikiula and Laukiamanuikahiki."

They lived as husband and wife for fifty days when Kahikiula begged that he be allowed to return to Kahikiku. Laukiamanuikahiki then said: “You cannot go unless you take me along with you.” “It cannot be, for you will surely experience terrible suffering through the anger of your sister-in-law. You must remain, and I will return.” As Kahikiula kept begging so often to return to Kahikiku, Laukiamanuikahiki finally consented and allowed him to go, saying: “Yes, you may return, but don’t blame me if I should decide to follow you later on, or I will kill you and also your wife, Kahalaokolepuupuu.” Kahikiula then took his departure and returned to Kahikiku to live with Kahalaokolepuupuu. Laukiamanuikahiki remained, but was so overcome with love for Kahikiula, that she wept; and when she saw the clouds drifting in the sky towards Kahikiku, she chanted the following lines:"
"Kau ana ka la e kau ana, Kau ana ke aloha i kuu maka, Ke hooluhi nei la i kuu kino, Ke lalawe nei la i kuu aoao, Aloha ka ukana a ke aloha la, He waimaka e. [ ]","The sun is up, it is up, My love is ever up before me. It is causing me great anxiety, It is pricking me at my side For love is a burden, when one is in love, And falling tears are its due.

"Hiki mai la ka honu kua wawaka wahi ae la ke kua a hamama, komo iho la keia i loko o ke kua, popoi ae la a paa, luu aku la ka honu a hiki i Kahikiku.

Laukiamanuikahiki then entered into the turtle, the top was closed and the turtle dove under water and swam until it arrived at Kahikiku. Upon its arrival at Kahikiku the turtle uncovered its back and Laukiamanuikahiki walked out on the seashore, while the turtle disappeared. Laukiamanuikahiki then went on her way until she came to a fish pond which belonged to Kahalaokolepuupuu, the wife of Kahikiula. At this place Laukiamanuikahiki changed herself into the form of an old woman and concealed her identity by calling out:"
"E kini o ke ’kua, E ka lehu o ke ’kua, E ka lalani o ke ’kua, E ka pukui o ke ’kua, E ke kaikuaana o ke ’kua, E ke kokoo-ha o ke ’kua E ke koo-lima o ke ’kua, E lawe ae oukou i kuu kino maikai, huna oukou a nalo, Haawi mai oukou i kino luahine no’u, kolopupu, haumakaiole.","Ye forty thousand gods, Ye four hundred thousand gods, Ye rows of gods, Ye collection of gods, Ye older brothers of the gods, Ye four-fold gods, Ye five-fold gods, Take away my good looks and keep it concealed.

Within this fish pond owned by Kahalaokolepuupuu, were kept the aholehole, nehu, iao, and all fish of this species and moss. Through the supernatural powers of Laukiamanuikahiki all the fish in the pond disappeared, which left the pond without a single fish. While she was crawling along the seashore two messengers from Kahalaokolepuupuu arrived and called out: “Say, you old woman, you have taken all the queen’s fish. You are a thieving old woman.” She replied: “I did not take them. The fish from this pond disappeared long before this; but since you have seen me here you are attributing their disappearance to me.” At this time she was given a new name, Lipewale, by the messengers. They then said to the old woman: “Let us go to the house, your name, Lipewale, is that of the queen’s sickness.” When they arrived at the house, one of the messengers said: “There is not a single fish in the pond, all have been taken by this old woman. When we found her she was taking the sea-eggs.” Kahalaokolepuupuu then addressed the old woman saying: “I am going to call you Lipewale, the name of my ailment. You will take this name, will you not? I will supply you with food, clothing, house to live in and you will live with me.”"
"Moe iho la lakou i ka po, hele mai la o Kahikiula ma kahi o Lipewale e moe nei, lele iho la honi i ka ihu, kahea ae keia: “Owai keia e honi nei ia’u?” Kahea mai o Kahalaokolepuupuu: “E Lipewale, heaha ia?” Paa loa ko ia nei waha, aohe ekemu aku.

[ ]","That night when they retired, Kahikiula approached the place where Lipewale was sleeping and kissed her. She then cried out: “Who is kissing me?” Upon hearing this Kahalaokolepuupuu called out: “What is it, Lipewale?” But she would not answer. In doing this Kahikiula showed that he had recognized his sister, Laukiamanuikahiki. [ ]"
"Pela ka ia nei mau hana i na po a pau loa; ina e ike keia e moe pu ana ke kaikunane me ka wahine i kahi hookahi, ala ae la keia hoonakeke i na paipu, holo mai la ke kaikoeke ninau, hai aku la keia he iole; no ka mea, he huhu keia i ka moe pu o laua la.","This was carried on for several nights. Whenever she knew that her brother and sister-in-law were about to retire together, she would get up and rattle the calabashes forcing her sister-in-law to come and ask her reason for thus creating a disturbance; when she would say, that it was a rat; she did this because she did not want them to sleep together."
"I mai la ke kaikoeke: “E Lipewale e pii kakou i kukui kapala no kuu pau, i uka.” Ae aku la keia: “Ae.” A hiki lakou i uka, hoiliili iho la a loaa ke kukui, hana iho la a haawe, olelo mai lao Kahalaokolepuupuu: “E Lipewale, ia oe ke kukui a kakou e haawe ai.” “Ae, ia’u.” Kaha aku la lakou la iho, kaa iho la o Lipewale mahope me ka haawe kukui.

When they arrived at the place, they collected the kukui nuts and put them into a bundle. After this was done Kahalaokolepuupuu said to Lipewale: “You will have to carry our bundle of kukui nuts.” “Yes, I will take it.” The others then went on ahead leaving Lipewale behind with the bundle of nuts tied to her back. After she started on her way, she put her hands behind her back, opened the bundle and allowed the kukui nuts to drop on the road. When they arrived at the house all the nuts were gone. Upon being questioned: “Say, Lipewale, what has become of your kukui nuts?” She answered: “You fixed the bundle and I put it on my back and followed behind you. I have no eyes at my back to see whether the nuts were falling out of the bundle or not.” After this Kahalaokolepuupuu said to Lipewale: “You will have to stay home and print my pa-u while the rest of us go down and have a sea bath.” Lipewale was therefore left behind to print the pa-u. She first went out and got some filth and came back and proceeded to carry out the order by smearing the bambu sticks lengthwise and crosswise and began the printing of the pa-u. This did not take very long, so she followed along behind the others and went in sea bathing. On the way down to the sea, she caused herself to be transformed back to her usual self and she again possessed all her beauty. She continued on down and when she was near the others she passed on by and bathed at some distance from them. When she was finished she went right along up home. When the others saw her returning home they chased on behind, but they could not catch up and she arrived at home some time before the others, when she was once more transformed into the form of an old woman. When the others arrived at home, they asked her: “Say, did you see a beautiful woman who came up this way from below?” “No, I have not seen her. I have been sitting out here all this time until you returned.” After the others had gone to the dancing house she remained with her brother Kahikiula. She went outside of the house and called out:"

A ua hele lakou e kaapuni ma ka aina a puni, aole mea aa mai ia lakou. Ia lakou e kaapuni ana i ka aina o Kuaihelani, kaulana aku la ka ikaika o Kealohikikaupea, no Kauai ia kanaka.

A hiki lakou i Oahu nei, hakoko iho la lakou, hookahi no puupuu, waiho ana ua mau kanaka ala o Oahu nei i lalo, a haalele iho la lakou. Hele lakou a Maui, e noho ana o Kakaalaneo ke ’lii o Maui, hakoko no make no ia lakou nei.","The main pastime indulged in by the brothers of Aukelenuiaiku was wrestling, boxing and other manly games that were known at that time. In these games they became famous in all the land of Kuaihelani as being the strongest, and furthermore, these boys went around the whole country without being beaten. On one of the trips around Kuaihelani the fame and the strength of Kealohikikaupea, a strong man of Kauai, reached these boys. The main deed of strength participated in by this man which made him famous was the great ease he had in breaking a man in two. When the boys from Kuaihelani arrived in Kauai, one of them met this strong man and with one blow laid him low. They then made a complete circuit of Kauai without meeting [ ] any challenger. While they were in Kauai word came to them of three strong men on Oahu. Their names were, Kaikipaananea, Kupukupukehaikalani and Kupukupukehaiiaku. There were none stronger than these three men. Upon the arrival of the champions of Kuaihelani on Oahu they met in contest, and with one blow the said men of Oahu were defeated, after which the Kuaihelani champions left Oahu and went to Maui. Kakaalaneo was the king of Maui at this time, and in a contest he was vanquished by them."
"Ia lakou ma Maui e kaapuni ana, kaulana mai la o Kepakailiula i ka ikaika a me ke koa, e hiki ia ia e haihai i ke kanaka, a oia ka oi o Hawaii a puni. A lohe lakou i kona kaulana i ka ikaika, makau iho la lakou a hoi mai la i Kuaihelani.

No ka mea, o Aukelenuiaiku, ua paa loa ia i ka palama ia i ko lakou makuakane e Iku, ma ke ano kapu alii, a me ka punahele loa.","While the Kuaihelani champions were making a circuit of Maui the fame of Kepakailiula for his great strength and daring came to them. It was said that he could break [in pieces] any man who opposed him, and he was the greatest warrior of the whole island of Hawaii. When the Kuaihelani champions heard of the feats of strength performed by Kepakailiula, they became afraid and returned to Kuaihelani. Upon their arrival at their home in Kuaihelani they gave exhibitions of all the sporting games known to them, such as wrestling, boxing, to wrestle on all fours, to hide a pebble under piles of kapas, to dance, to roll the stone disk, to jump from high cliffs into the water, to make the spear glide, and various other games. In getting up these games they were instigated by the desire of drawing their youngest brother to them, when they would kill him, for Aukelenuiaiku was kept under Iku’s fostering care all the time, and was accorded all the honors due to a king, and was jealously guarded."
"Ma keia noho kapu ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua lohe ia aku la ka pihe uwa a na kaikuaana ona, e lealea ana, alaila, ninau aku la o Aukelenuiaiku ia Iku, ko lakou makuakane: “He pihe aha keia o kai e uwa nei?” Hai aku ka makuakane: “He hakoko.” “Pehea ia mea?” “Elua kanaka, ku i luna, kulai kekahi i kekahi, a hina kekahi, alaila, uwa ka aha. Oia kela pihe au e lohe la i ka uwauwa mai.” Alaila, i aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Makemake wale.” Pela no o Aukelenuiaiku i ninaninau mau ai i ko lakou makuakane. Alaila nonoi aku la ia e iho e nana. Hoole mai ko lakou makuakane: “Aole oe e iho.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku : “No ke aha hoi?” I mai ka makuakane: “Mamuli oe make i ou mau kaikuaana, no ka mea, ua hoomauhala ou kaikuaana ia oe e noho nei.” Ninau aku la o Aukelenuiaiku : “Heaha ka hala i hoomau ai?” I aku ka makuakane: “He hala, oia kuu hooili ana i ke kapu nou a me ke aupuni; nolaila mai iho oe, o make auanei i ou mau kaikuaana.”","While Aukelenuiaiku was thus guarded, he one day heard the yells and shouts of the people who were gathered at the games being held by his brothers, so Aukelenuiaiku asked of Iku his father: “What is the cause of the shouting down below?” The father replied: “They are holding some wrestling matches.” “How is that game played?” “It is played by two persons. They stand up facing each other and each one tries to throw the other one down to the ground. When one is thrown the people would shout, expressing their joy. That is the cause of the shouting that you hear.” Aukelenuiaiku then said: “How I wish to see it!” He therefore questioned his father relating to the various games. After hearing how they were played, he asked that he be allowed to go down and look on, but his father refused, saying: “You cannot go down.” Aukelenuiaiku then asked him: “Why not?” The father replied: “You will be killed by your brothers, for they hate you.” Aukelenuiaiku then further asked his father: “What is the cause of the hatred?” The father replied: “There is a reason. It is because I have given you all the honors and the kingdom. Therefore you must not go down, for if you do you will be killed by your brothers.”"
"A hala he anahulu, alaila, lohe hou ia mai la ka pihe uwa hou, aole o Aukelenuiaiku i hai aku i ko lakou makuakane, no keia leo uwa hou.

Ua like kona ili me ka maia pala memele, a o kona mau onohi maka me he opuu maia la o ka hua ana o ka wa hou, a he pololei hoi kona kino, aohe puu, aohe kee, aohe ona mea e like ai.","After ten days had gone by the shouting and yelling at the games were again heard, but Aukelenuiaiku did not let his father know of the renewal of the games. He then got up and secretly went down to look at the games, without the knowledge of his father. In going Aukelenuiaiku took an arrow with him. When Aukelenuiaiku arrived near the house where his brothers were holding the games, he shot the arrow into the building. On the arrow entering the building, the brothers took it up and said: [ ] “How strange! our arrows are in joints, but this one is twisted!” While they were discussing the matter one of them took it and after looking it over said: “This is not a stranger’s arrow; this is the arrow belonging to our brother Aukelenuiaiku.” While this brother was saying this, Kekamakahinuiaiku, he of the bad temper, took it and broke it into pieces. Shortly after this Aukelenuiaiku approached the building and stood on the outside of the wall which surrounded the building. While Aukelenuiaiku was standing there, all the brothers looked at him. They marveled at his handsome appearance: his skin was like the ripe banana and his eyeballs were like the bud of a banana at its first appearance; his body was straight and faultless, and he was without equal."

Uwa ae la na kanaka.","When the people who were gathered there saw Aukelenuiaiku, they expressed words of praise at his great comeliness. While the people were praising Aukelenuiaiku, the oldest brother became very angry and his face changed. He then sent out one of his younger brothers to go and ask Aukelenuiaiku the reason of his coming. The name of the brother that was sent was Kuaiku. When he had come into the presence of Aukelenuiaiku, he asked him: “What has brought you here?” Aukelenuiaiku answered: “To enjoy the games.” Kuaiku returned to their angry brother and told him. When he heard this, he again sent Kuaiku, saying: “Go and strike him once.” When Kuaiku came up to Aukelenuiaiku, he struck at him, but he did not knock him down nor did he hurt him. On the first blow he broke his own right arm, then he tried his left and that too was broken. When Kuaiku saw that his two arms were broken he turned to proceed back to the house. At this Aukelenuiaiku reached out and took hold of his brother by the arms, bundled him up, and threw him to the edge of the sea. When the people saw the great strength of Aukelenuiaiku, they gave a mighty shout, and said: “That is the only man that has been able to throw and break the arms of Kuaiku.” After this another of the brothers came out with the intention of killing Aukelenuiaiku. This brother was the greatest wrestler and could break a man in arms; but when he met Aukelenuiaiku, he was unable to throw him down or hurt him. When he found that he was unable to throw Aukelenuiaiku, he turned with the intention of going back to the house, but Aukelenuiaiku reached out, held him up and threw him into the sea. This made the people shout again."

When this brother saw that all his younger brothers had been defeated by Aukelenuiaiku he went up full of anger, bent on throwing Aukelenuiaiku into the sea, but in this he proved a failure, for his youngest brother overmatched him. While they were fighting and pushing each other, Aukelenuiaiku held his ground so well that the oldest brother became exhausted, and in time gave up all idea of fighting, and he left Aukelenuiaiku and turned with the intention of going back to the house. At this Aukelenuiaiku reached out, took hold of him, and threw him bodily into the sea. When he dropped [ ] into the sea his desire of killing Aukelenuiaiku vanished and he began to show signs of regret and pretended to be friendly. When he came up to Aukelenuiaiku he said: “Let us cease the conflict and all hatred and let us be friends, since this is only a fight between brothers.” He then invited Aukelenuiaiku to go to the house, which invitation was accepted by Aukelenuiaiku, believing it to be sincere. When they entered the house the oldest brother uncovered the deep pit of Kamooinanea, and took hold of Aukelenuiaiku and threw him down into it, where the brothers thought Aukelenuiaiku would die."
"A haule o Aukelenuiaiku i lalo o ka lua, aia hoi, elua kanaka e noho ana. Mamua o ko Aukelenuiaiku haule ana, ko laua haule ana i lalo o ka lua. Na ua poe kaikuaana la no o Aukelenuiaiku i kiola.

When the two men saw Aukelenuiaiku, they took pity on him because he was so handsome and pleasant to look upon, having a perfect physique, and being without blemish. While the two were talking together, Aukelenuiaiku heard them and so he asked them: “What are you two talking about?” They answered: “We are expressing our regrets because we pity you.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this he asked them: “And why?” The men replied: “Because of the death by the great lizard, Kamooinanea.” Aukelenuiaiku again asked: “When will the lizard come forth?” The men replied: “When the tide rises and falls, then rises and falls again, and when it comes up the third time, then the lizard comes up with it; then we will all be killed.”"
"A pau ka olelo ana a laua ia Aukelenuiaiku, mahope o laila, pii mai la ua moo nei o Kamooinanea, a kahea mai la: “E, Aukelenuiaiku e! homai oe i kekahi [ ] kanaka i mea ai na’u.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Haawi aku auanei au ia oe, i aha hoi ko’u hoanoho o keia wahi mehameha?” Alaila, nalowale aku la ua moo nei mai ko lakou mau maka aku.

When they saw the lizard and how terrible it looked they were sore afraid, and the two men began to show signs of uneasiness. After the lizard had disappeared from their sight, the men said to Aukelenuiaiku: “How wonderful! here this lizard is acquainted [ ] with your name. This is the first time that the lizard has not come and devoured its prey outright. We were told that immediately the lizard made its appearance , it would come and devour its victims; but here we see that we are safe for a time. Should it disappear altogether, we will escape death.”"
"Olelo mai la ua moo nei ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E kii oe i elua lau ape.” A loaa na lau ape ia Aukelenuiaiku, lawe aku la ia i mua o ua moo nei, a luai iho la ua moo nei i luna o na lau ape elua, a piha ae la. I aku la ia ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E ka moopuna, e nana oe.” Nana iho la o Aukelenuiaiku. Alaila, i mai la ua moo nei: “He mau aina keia e ku nei i loko o ka lau ape, he aina nui, he aina uuku, he aina mahana, he aina wela, he aina anu.

Mai keia wahi a’u e olelo nei ia oe, malaila oe e hele ai.”","The lizard then said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Go and bring me two ape leaves.” When Aukelenuiaiku returned with the ape leaves he placed them in front of the lizard. The lizard then vomited onto the two leaves until they were covered over, and then it said to Aukelenuiaiku: “My grandson, look on these two leaves.” Aukelenuiaiku obeyed and looked on. The lizard then continued: “Here are two lands on these two ape leaves, a large land and a small land; a warm and hot land, and a cold land. These two lands, however, Holaniku and Holanimoe, are very beautiful lands and they possess everything necessary for the comfort of mankind; they possess food, fish, sugar-cane, potatoes, bananas, awa, breadfruit and all other things good to eat. Where I direct you there you must go.”"
"A pau nei mau olelo a ua moo la ia Aukelenuiaiku, i aku la ia: “E moe i lalo.” Moe iho la o Aukelenuiaiku i lalo, paa aku la ua moo nei ma ka puhaka o ka moopuna: “E kuu moopuna, ou kaikuaana, e pau ana lakou i ka make ia oe, a e lilo ana oe i alii maluna o lakou, no ka mea, ua hana ino lakou ia oe.” Hai hou aku la no ua moo nei, i kana moopuna ia Aukelenuiaiku: “O keia aina nae, eono malama e malamalama ai, a eono malama e pouli ai; mai hele oe malaila o make oe, no ka mea, mamua aku o keia wahi, he kai omaomao, a hala ia, he kai ulaula aku, mai hele oe malaila o make oe.

The lizard then held her grandson by the waist and said: “My grandson, you will yet be the cause of the death of your older brothers, and shall be king over them all; because they have ill-treated you.” The lizard then continued, saying: “This land, however,” pointing to one, “during six months is lighted and during six months it is in darkness; don’t go there, for you will be killed: because, before you come to this land you will have to cross a green sea; after that is passed, you will come to a red sea; don’t go there, for you will get killed; because in the days before I was married I traveled over this land, and now I am old, yet I have not completed its entire circuit. The name of this land is Kalakeenuiakane (Asia, according to the foreigners). The mountains are so high that the stars [ ] appear on them, and there are very few people living on it. The owner of the land is Namakaokahai, a chiefess, and she has four brothers: Kanemoe, Kaneikaapua, Leapua and Kahaumana. She has two servants, Upoho and Haapuainanea. Those who guard and watch over the land are Moela, a dog, and three birds, Manuea, Kiwaha and Halulu. These are all the people who live on the land; there are not many, because the people are devoured by the ghosts.”"
"Ma keia nalowale ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua nui ke aloha o ko lakou makuakane nona, a ua kanikau ia me ke aloha i na la a pau loa, a ua hookeai a ua hoohiki iho oia aole e ai i ka ai a make ia, no ka minamina ia Aukelenuiaiku.

Because of his great grief he refused to take food. After suffering for days he expressed a wish to die. But the mother of Aukelenuiaiku did not think that her son was dead, and she refused to listen to her husband, to fast and to mourn for their son. She was certain that Aukelenuiaiku was not dead, and that her lizard mother, Kamooinanea, had not devoured him. In discussing with her husband as to the prospects of their son being eaten up by the lizard she said: “If she has eaten him, who is my own issue, then she should have eaten me up first, and after that, my son. I tell you now that Aukelenuiaiku is there down below being educated by his grandmother in all things, and he is not dead. He will yet return to us here above.” These words of the wife all came true."
"A pau na mea a pau loa i ka loaa ia Aukelenuiaiku, ia wa, kau ae la o Aukelenuiaiku i luna o ka moo, hapai ae la ia ia Aukelenuiaiku a kau i luna o ka lua, a hoi aku la ka moo i lalo o ka lua.

[ ]",After all the various things had been mastered by Aukelenuiaiku he then climbed onto the back of the lizard and was lifted up out of the pit; and the lizard again disappeared down the pit. Aukelenuiaiku then took up the box that contained his god together with his club and carried them as he returned to the house. When Aukelenuiaiku reached the house his father and all the chiefs wept for joy. [ ]

While Aukelenuiaiku was weeping with his parents, his brothers, who were out surf riding, heard the wailing and so asked: “For whom is this wailing going on?” “It is Aukelenuiaiku.” When the brothers heard that the wailing was because of the return of Aukelenuiaiku they were so ashamed that they concluded they would build them a ship and go to some foreign land. They then rode in on the surf and proceeded direct to the forest. After they had been in the forest for over two months, Aukelenuiaiku one day went up into the forest to catch him some birds. After he had caught and cleaned several birds he started a fire and then put them on the coals to roast. After the birds were cooked he sat down to his meal, and, while he was eating, his brothers came upon him and took away all the birds, leaving him nothing. After this the oldest brother, he with the violent temper, ordered Aukelenuiaiku to go and bring them some water. While Aukelenuiaiku was on his way for water he got up and followed him. While Aukelenuiaiku was busy filling the calabash with water the angry brother arrived and replaced the rock on the mouth of the water hole, shutting in Aukelenuiaiku and left him there to die."
"A mahope o keia uwe ana, pii aku la o Ikumailani e huli. Mamua ae o kona pii ana, olelo aku ko lakou makuakane ia ia: “I pii oe a loaa ko kaikaina, e hoihoi mai oe a hiki i ka hale nei.” Mamua ae o ka pii ana o Ikumailani, olelo aku ia i ko lakou makuakane: “E! ke pii nei au, i nana ae oe a i a ke ahi, ua loaa ko keiki, a i a ole mai, aole i loaa ia’u.” A pau kana kamailio ana, pii aku la o Ikumailani e huli.

A pau ko laua uwe ana, ho-a ae la o Ikumailani i ke ahi, a ike mai la ko lakou makuakane, manao iho la ia, ua loaa o Aukelenuiaiku, aole i make.","After this weeping Ikumailani again proceeded up the forest in search of his brother. Before starting upon his mission their father said to him: “In case you should find your brother, bring him home here.” Before Ikumailani set out he said to their father: “I am going up; if you look and see a fire, remember I have found your son; but in case you don’t see a fire, then I have not found him.” After saying this, Ikumailani started out on his search. When he came up to the water hole he looked and saw that the mouth had been covered with a large rock. He then rolled away the rock and looked down into the hole, and saw Aukelenuiaiku standing there, thin and weak, having only enough strength left to be able to stand. Ikumailani then reached down for his brother and lifted him up; they then kissed each other and wept. After their weeping, Ikumailani started a fire, which was seen by their father, and he knew that Aukelenuiaiku had been found and that he was not dead."
"A makaukau ka holo o ka moku, ninau aku la o Aukelenuiaiku i kona kaikuaana oluolu ia Ikumailani: “E holo ana ko oukou moku i hea?” “I ka imi aina.” Wahi a Aukelenuiaiku: “A i aha ia no ka hoi keia aina?” I mai o Ikumailani: “Ua hilahila ke kaikuaana o kakou i ko ola hou ana mai nei, nolaila keia holo o ka moku e imi aina. A loaa ka aina ia makou, maloko o ka ikaika, alaila, o ko makou aina ia e noho ai.”","After all the preparations for the sailing had been completed, Aukelenuiaiku asked of Ikumailani, the brother who had shown him some love: “Where is your ship sailing for?” “In search of land.” Aukelenuiaiku again asked: “And what is the matter with this land?” Ikumailani replied: “Our oldest brother is ashamed, because of your return. That is the reason why the ship is about to sail off in search of some land. After a [new] land is conquered through our strength, that will be our place to dwell.”"
"A lohe o Aukelenuiaiku i ko lakou holo, nonoi aku la ia; “Owau kekahi e holo me oukou.” Olelo mai kona kaikuaana o Ikumailani: “Aole oe e holo me makou, no ka mea, aohe o makou kumu e ae o ka holo, o oe wale no.

Nolaila, ke nonoi aku nei au, owau kekahi e holo me oukou, i make oukou ko’u poe kaikuaana, alaila, make pu aku wau. Alaila, kaulana ka inoa i hope nei, ‘O mea ma, make pu no me ko lakou pokii.’ Nolaila, aole e waia ka inoa mahope nei.”","When Aukelenuiaiku heard the object of the sailing of the ship, he begged that he too be allowed to sail with them. His brother Ikumailani then said to him: “You cannot go with us, because we have no other reason of going away except on your own account. If you had died we would not be leaving Kuaihelani.” By this refusal on the part of his brother, Aukelenuiaiku said in kindly reply: “Say, don’t you know that it is a sad thing to go off to some strange land and die there. Your bones will be put away by a stranger, perhaps even by a friend, but not by a younger brother, one who has been born with you and who was from the same womb. I therefore beg of you that I too be allowed to sail with you, so that in case you my older brothers should die, then I will die with you. Then our names will come back in fame in the saying, ‘So-and-so have died with their younger brother.’ Then your names will not be spoken in disrespect.”"
"Ma keia mau olelo a kakou e lohe nei, he mea e ko Aukelenuiaiku imi hala, a, hilahila ole no hoi, me kona ike pono iho no, na kona mau kaikuaana kona pilikia. O ka mea aiwa loa aku ka ia i ka hahai e hoomano ai. Nolaila, ina he oiaio na ko Aukelenuiaiku waha ponoi keia, ua ae ia kona mau poino, a ua pono no ia ke make.

A ua hooko ia hoi kana mau olelo wanana no Aukelenuiaiku, ma keia holo ana o ka moku.","By these remarks we see how determined Aukelenuiaiku was in trying to follow his brothers, when he knew that all his troubles had come from these same men. With all this he still wished and insisted on going with them. If this is so, then we cannot blame the older brothers if they should kill him. In this request, that he be allowed to accompany them, however, we will see how he for a time managed to save his brothers from death, and how he came to have all the benefits foretold him by his lizard grandmother; and how all the advice she gave Aukelenuiaiku was faithfully kept to his salvation."
"A pau ka Aukelenuiaiku olelo ana, i mai kona kaikuaana oluolu, o Ikumailani: “Aole oe e holo ia’u, aka, e hele oe a ke keiki a kakou olelo aku, a i ae mai, alaila oe holo.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Pehea auanei au e olelo aku ai e hoolohe mai ai kela [ ] ia’u?” “E hele oe a kahea aku ma kona inoa ponoi, penei: ‘E Kaumailunaoh olaniku e! e kahea mai oe ia’u e pii aku kaua i luna o ka moku, e lealea ai kaua, e paani ai, aole oe e kohu me keia poe elemakule, owau kou hoa e kohu ai, he kamalii, he kamalii.’ ” A pau ke aoao ana a kona kaikuaana ia ia, olelo mai ko lakou makuakane ia ia: “E kuu keiki, mai hele oe, o make hou oe.

You must go to our nephew and tell him of your wish. If he gives his consent, then you will be able to go.” Aukelenuiaiku [ ] then asked him: “How am I to get him to listen to me?” “You go and call him by his name in this way: ‘Say, Kaumailunaoholaniku, ask me to come up on the ship with you so that we may play together. You cannot enjoy yourself with those old men. I am the proper companion that will be suited to you, because you are young and so am I.’ ” After these instructions had been imparted by his older brother, their father who was listening said: “My boy, don’t go with them, for you will be killed. When you are not safe living with me, what chance will you have when you accompany them? If you insist on going you will surely get killed, and your mother and I will not see you again.” Aukelenuiaiku answered: “I will not remain with you two. I am going sightseeing and to visit other lands in the sea; therefore I am going.”"

Oia wale no ka leo oi.","After the above conversation, Aukelenuiaiku proceeded to the ship with Ikumailani his brother. When they arrived at the ship, his brother went aboard, leaving Aukelenuiaiku below on the landing. Aukelenuiaiku then called out to his nephew, and after telling him what he wanted, he was invited by the nephew to come aboard in the following words: “My uncle, come aboard of the vessel.” Upon receiving this invitation, Aukelenuiaiku climbed aboard, while his older brothers looked on, for they dared not deny their nephew his wish. The boy was their great favorite; whatever he said was law with them, and all the uncles obeyed his every word. This boy was raised under a very strict kapu; and if he ordered that a person be killed, that person is killed; if he ordered that a person be allowed to go free, that person goes off free. Therefore this boy’s person was sacred, and whatever he said was law; nothing was denied him, and no one dared say nay to him. They all obeyed him."

When the boy heard this, he sent a couple of men after these things. After the men had returned with these things, the ship started off on its voyage from Kuaihelani. In the first four months of the voyage their food, meat and water, were exhausted and the men began to die of hunger and thirst, and the brothers were in great distress. When the brothers found that all their food was exhausted, they went down into the body of the ship and stayed there, while Aukelenuiaiku and the boy stayed above. After several days had gone by, the boy began to wonder at the disappearance of his father and uncles, so he went down into the ship to look for them. When he got to the bottom of the vessel he found his father and uncles lying weak from hunger. The boy then climbed onto the breast of his father, Kekamakahinuiaiku, the one with the violent temper, and who hated Aukelenuiaiku most of all. As the boy sat on his father’s chest, the father looked up and when he saw his son he said: “Yes, how pitiful! I have no regrets as far as we are concerned, for we have spent many days in this world; but it is you that I pity, for all the food, the meat and water are gone, and all that is left is two joints of sugar-cane.” The boy replied: “I am not distressed, for I am not in need of food, for my uncle has a certain leaf which we touch to our lips and our hunger is satisfied, and we stay without wanting any food for four months.” After talking with his father for a while, he returned to his uncle, Aukelenuiaiku, [ ] with tears in his eyes. When the uncle saw that the boy was crying, he asked him: “What are you weeping for? Why these tears that you are shedding?” The boy replied: “I am weeping for my father, Kekamakahinuiaiku, who is almost dead of hunger. When I reached him he was gasping for breath.” Aukelenuiaiku then said to the boy: “My boy, you too would have died with your father and uncles in this ocean if I had not come along with you. I am hated by your father as his most bitter enemy, but according to our birth by our parents, I will not act as they have toward me. Therefore, my boy, here is the food, the meat, and the water in this club of ours (the name of this club was Kaiwakaapu); take it and open one end of the club, and the food, the meat, the kapa and everything else will come out of their own accord.” The boy then followed the direction of his uncle, Aukelenuiaiku, and all the things necessary for their comfort were furnished them. The father and uncles and those of the ship ate and were saved. Their faintness from hunger disappeared as well as their weakness."
"A pau na malama eha ma keia holo ana i ka moana, hoomaka ka la mua o ka lima o ka malama. Ia wa, hai aku o Aukelenuiaiku i kona ike i na kaikuaana, a me na kanaka a pau o luna o ka moku: “Apopo ike kakou i ka aina, a ku no ia la, o ka inoa o ua aina ala o Holaniku. He nui na me ai o ia aina, ka ai, ka awa, ke ko, ka maia, ka niu, a me na mea a pau loa.”","After they were saved from death, the ship sailed on for another four months; but the food and water were so plentiful that they wasted a lot. But other things were also furnished them by the club of Aukelenuiaiku. At the end of the second four months and they had entered into the first day of the fifth month, Aukelenuiaiku told his older brothers as well as to the other men on board the ship, saying: “Tomorrow we will see land and shall go ashore the same day. The name of the land is Holaniku. The land contains many things that are good to eat: food, awa, sugar cane, bananas, coconuts and various other things.”"
"A hala ka la ana i hoakaka ai, hiki mai ka lua o ka la, o ia kana la i olelo ai e ku i ka aina o Holaniku. I ke kakahiaka nui, ike mua ia mai la ke kuahiwi o ka aina, a awakea, ku lakou i ka aina.

As soon as the ship touched land the men went ashore where they found food, water, meat, awa and various other things. They stayed on the land for four days and four nights, when they again boarded their ship and set sail. After sailing for four months, Aukelenuiaiku said to his brothers: “Tomorrow we will reach land.” When his brothers heard this, they said: “You are deceiving us.” But there was none of them who could deny the fact, for Aukelenuiaiku showed that he knew what he was talking about; so the sailing masters all admitted that Aukelenuiaiku was correct. But the brothers being bitter against Aukelenuiaiku, refused to believe him."
"A kokoke mai la ka la a Aukelenuiaiku i olelo ai, ike aku la lakou i ka aina o Kalakeenuiakane. Ma ia la a po, a ao, a kakahiaka ku lakou i ka aina. O ke ’lii o ua aina ala he wahine, o Namakaokahai ka inoa.","On the approach of the next day, the day Aukelenuiaiku had predicted they would see land, the voyagers saw land, the land of Kalakeenuiakane; and it took all that day and night until the morning of the next day before they reached shore. The land was ruled by a queen, called Namakaokahai."
"I aku o Aukelenuiaiku i na kaikuaana: “Ia’u ka olelo o ka moku o kakou.” I mai na kaikuaana: “Aole no hoi e kapili i moku nou, alaila no hoi olelo.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Ina ia’u ka olelo o ka moku, ola kakou, ina ia oukou, make kakou, [ ] aole e ola.” Olelo mai na kaikuaana ia Aukelenuiaiku: “Ihea la kau ao ana i neia mea he ikaika a me ke koa, i olelo ai oe maluna o makou e noho malie, a o oe ka waha olelo.” “He oiaio ia, ina he kaua ma ka lima, a ma ke alo, alaila, na oukou ka eha a me ka make; aka, ina he kaua poipu, aole e loaa ia oukou, nolaila au i olelo ai, e make ana kakou.” I mai na kaikuaana: “Aole no au olelo no keia mau mea a pau loa, aia no i ko makou manao, e noho malie no oe.” Ma kea mau olelo a kona mau kaikuaana, noho malie iho la o Aukelenuiaiku, aohe olelo aku.","When they touched land Aukelenuiaiku said to his brothers: “Let me have charge of the ship?” The brothers said: “Why don’t you build yourself a ship, then you can have all the say.” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “If I have charge of the ship we will all be saved, but if you insist on taking charge of it yourself we will all be killed, [ ] none will be saved.” The brothers replied to Aukelenuiaiku, saying: “Where did you learn to be strong and brave, so that you could have the right to tell us to hold our peace while you take charge of everything.” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “It would be quite right if it were to be a hand to hand fight, where you could meet your enemy face to face. There would be no doubt then, for you would surely win, but if the fight is to be otherwise, you will not win. This is the reason why I said that we will all be killed.” The brothers said: “You have nothing to say in the matter, anyhow. It is going to be as we wish it, and you must keep quiet.” When the brothers said this, Aukelenuiaiku did not make any reply."

She then sent her brothers, the four birds, to fly to the ship and inquire the object of its coming. The names of these brothers of Namakaokahai, were Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana. The brothers then flew in their bird form and lit on the yards and asked: “What is the object of this ship coming here?” The brothers answered: “It is a ship to make war.” When the birds heard this they returned to Namakaokahai. When they arrived they were asked: “What is that ship here for?” “It is a ship to make war.” When Namakaokahai heard this, she came and stood on the outside of the house, and girded on her war pau while she held her war kahili in her hand."
"Aka, mamua ae o ka lohe ana o Namakaokahai i na kaikunane manu ona, olelo aku o Aukelenuiaiku i na kaikuaana ona: “E! auhea oukou, i hele hou mai na manu e ninau i ka moku nei, e hai aku oukou, he moku makaikai keia, aohe moku kaua.” Ia Aukelenuiaiku e olelo ana, hiki mai la na manu i ka moku, a ninau hou mai la: “Heaha ka hana a keia moku o ka holo ana mai i anei?” I aku na kaikuaana o Aukelenuiaiku: “He moku kaua.”","Before Namakaokahai received her brothers’ report, Aukelenuiaiku said to them: “Say, where are you all? The birds are coming back and will again inquire of the object of our coming. When they arrive, you tell them that the ship is only on a voyage of sightseeing, and not a ship to make war.” While Aukelenuiaiku was still talking the birds arrived on the ship and again asked: “What is the object of the coming of this ship?” The brothers of Aukelenuiaiku replied: “It is a ship to make war.”"

As the box struck the water, Aukelenuiaiku jumped in after it and taking hold of it he swam away from the ship. While Aukelenuiaiku was swimming the nephew called out after him, but Aukelenuiaiku replied: “You cannot follow me, you had better remain where you are.” While he was speaking to his nephew, Namakaokahai arrived at the seashore, took hold of her war pau and turned it to her rear, then she next took up her kahili and shook it in the air. [ ] No sooner than this was done, the ship together with the brothers of Aukelenuiaiku were turned into ashes. When Aukelenuiaiku looked behind him after swimming for some distance, he saw that the ship had disappeared, so he turned and swam with his box toward land."

And in the coming conflict we will see how Aukelenuiaiku and his god fought their battle, and how Namakaokahai became the wife of Aukelenuiaiku."

He then crawled under an ekoko tree and slept, for he was completely used up by his efforts to reach the shore. While Aukelenuiaiku was sleeping, Moela arrived, the dog who had the watching of all the land, and when he smelled the blood of the stranger he began to bark. While the dog was barking, Namakaokahai came out of the house and called out to her four bird brothers. When they came before her, she said: “You must go in search of this thing that the dog is barking at; it is possible that one of the men from the ship has come ashore. I cannot make out what the dog is barking at.” The brothers replied: “Send your two maid servants.” At this the queen was satisfied; so she called for her two maid servants, Upoho and Haapuainanea. When they came in the presence of the queen, she said to them: “I want you to go in search of the thing the dog is barking at. If you two should find it, kill it.”"

Mahope o keia ala ana o Aukelenuiaiku, aoao aku o Lonoikoualii ia ia, penei: “Ina i hiki mai na wahine elua, he mau wahine maikai, o ko laua mau ano nae, he moo, he iole, o Upoho ka iole, o Haapuainanea ka moo. A hiki mai laua, e waiho aku oe i mua o laua i ke aloha o keia aina, penei: ‘E walina hoi ia oe e Upoho, e walina hoi ia oe e Haapuainanea,’ na laua ia e hilahila ia oe, i ka loaa mua o ko laua inoa, alaila, ola oe.”","When they left to make their search, Lonoikoualii, the god of Aukelenuiaiku, said to him: “Here comes our death, they are coming in search of you, therefore you must get up.” Aukelenuiaiku then woke up and put on his war dress of ashes. As soon as this was done, Lonoikoualii began to direct him what to do in the following words: “When the two women arrive, who are very comely, although they will be in the form of a lizard and a rat, Upoho being the rat and Haapuainanea the lizard, you must greet them in the following manner: ‘My greetings to you, Upoho; and my greetings to you, Haapuainanea.’ That will shame them, because you have been able to discover their names; then you will be saved.”"
"A pau ka olelo ana a Lonoikoualii ia Aukelenuiaiku, hiki mai la o Upoho, a me Haapuainanea. Ia laua e hele mai ana, waiho mua aku o Aukelenuiaiku i ke aloha ia laua: “E walina ia oe e Upoho, e walina ia oe e Haapuainanea.” A lohe laua i ka leo aloha o Aukelenuiaiku, hilahila iho la laua, no ka loaa o ko laua inoa ia ia.

[ ]","At the close of these instructions from the god Lonoikoualii, Upoho and Haapuainanea arrived. While they were approaching the place, Aukelenuiaiku greeted them, saying: “My greetings to you, Upoho; and my greetings to you, Haapuainanea.” When the two women heard the greeting from Aukelenuiaiku, they were ashamed, because their names were known to this stranger. Upoho then asked of Haapuainanea: “What must we give in payment to this person who has called us by our right names?” The other replied: “Let us be friends.” Upoho assented to this, and they came and sat on either side of Aukelenuiaiku. [ ]"
"A launa ae la lakou nei ekolu, elua wahine, hookahi kane, o Aukelenuiaiku, a pau ka lakou mau olelo hoinainau, haule iho la lakou konane. Olelo aku o Aukelenuiaiku i na wahine:","After the three had become friends, the two women and Aukelenuiaiku, they began to converse of various matters and after a while a game of konane was proposed and played. Aukelenuiaiku then said to the women:"
"“O ke kui keia, o ka holo kela, Moe kawa, hapala ka ele, Na ke kea ka ai, Ku ka ehu o na waa liilii, I ke keiki o Kuaihelani.”","“This my turn; now it is your turn. Now we pause, the blacks cannot move, And the whites have won. The small canoes are as but dust, To the boy from Kuaihelani.”"
"A pau ka nanea ana, olelo aku na wahine ia Aukelenuiaiku: “I hoouna ia mai nei maua e make oe, no ka mea, ua ike ia oe e ka ilio a ke ’lii wahine o makou, e Moela; aka, e hoi ana maua a hoole aku, aole i loaa ia maua, a nana ia e hoouna mai i luna hou.”","After playing for a while, the women said to Aukelenuiaiku: “We have been sent to kill you, for you were discovered by the dog of our queen, Moela; but we are going back and report that we have failed to find the person the dog was barking at, and it will be for her to send some other officers.”"
"A hiki laua i mua o ke ’lii wahine, o Namakaokahai, ninau mai la ia: “Auhea ka olua mea i huli aku nei?” I aku na wahine: “Aole i loaa ia maua, a luna maua o ka pali a me ka laau, aohe loaa iki, a uka maua, a kai maua, aohe loaa iki.” Wahi a laua ia Namakaokahai: “Ua kuhihewa paha ka ilio, i ka hohono o ke koko i luna o ka mea ae kai, he kanaka, nolaila, hae.” Ia laua e olelo ana, kuu hou ae la ke ’lii wahine i ka ilio ana, ia Moela.

We went to the top of the cliff, and on the top of the trees, and we were unable to discover anybody. We went to the uplands and shorewards, but again we failed to find anyone.” The women then continued: “Perhaps the dog was mistaken and had smelled the blood of those that were slain; and because of that he barked.” While the two were making their report the queen again released her dog, Moela. As soon as this was done the dog began to bark again and he continued to do this for some time. When the queen saw this she sent for her four bird brothers, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana to come to her. When they came in the presence of the queen, she said to them: “I want you to go in search for the person that Moela is barking at. It may be a man, may be not; what is it?” As soon as she had issued her orders, the four birds flew away. When the birds were getting ready to make their flight, Lonoikoualii said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, here comes our death. There are four birds coming to meet us. You must greet them in the same way that you greeted the two women.”"
"A hiki lakou i mua o Aukelenuiaiku, kahea mai la o Aukelenuiaiku me ka leo aloha, penei: “E walina ia oe e Kanemoe; e walina ia oe e Kaneapua; E walina ia oe e Leapua; e walina ia oe e Kahaumana.” Aloha mai la no hoi lakou ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E walina hoi oe.” Mahope o ke aloha ana mai a Aukelenuiaiku ia lakou, kamailio malu iho la lakou no ka loaa o ko lakou inoa, olelo ae la o Kanemoe: “Kupanaha! i hea la kahi i loaa ai o ko kakou inoa ia ia, a i aha la auanei ka kakou uku ia ia.” I mai la kekahi: “Hookahi no a kakou uku ia ia, o ke kaikuahine o kakou, i wahine nana, alaila, o ko kakou kaikoeke keia.” Ae mai la ko lakou nui, [ ] alaila, olelo aku la lakou i keia mau olelo ia Aukelenuiaiku, a he mea oluolu loa ia i ko Aukelenuiaiku manao.","When the birds arrived in the presence of Aukelenuiaiku, he greeted them one by one saying: “My greetings to you, Kanemoe. My greetings to you, Kaneapua. My greetings to you, Leapua. My greetings to you, Kahaumana.” At this they all returned the greeting, saying: “Our greetings to you.” After greeting Aukelenuiaiku, they fell to conversing in low tones between themselves, wondering how it was possible that their names were known. After a while Kanemoe said: “How wonderful! How did he come to know our names? And what are we going to give him for this?” One of the others replied: “We have but one thing worthy of giving him, let our sister be given to him for a wife, and he will then be our brother-in-law.” The others [ ] all agreed to this, so the proposition was referred to Aukelenuiaiku who was of course much pleased with the idea."
"A pau ke kamailio ana me Aukelenuiaiku, hoi aku la lakou i ka hale, a hiki lakou, ninau mai la o Namakaokahai: “Auhea ka oukou mea i huli aku nei?” I aku na kaikunane: “Eia’e mahope, ua hookane aku nei makou nau, i loaa ona kaikoeke no makou, no ka mea, he kanaka maikai, aole kina mai luna a lalo, ua like no me oe, nolaila, ua pono no oe ke lawe o kau kane ia.” Ma keia mau olelo a kona mau kaikunane, he mea oluolu loa ia i ka manao o ke ’lii wahine, o Namakaokahai.

Maanei e ike ai kakou i ke ko ana o na olelo a ke ’kua o Aukelenuiaiku, a i ka mana no hoi o Aukelenuiaiku.","After the thing was settled the four birds started ahead for the house, while Aukelenuiaiku followed on behind. When the birds arrived, Namakaokahai asked: “Where is the person that you went in search of?” The brothers replied: “He is coming later. We have offered you to him as his wife so that we will have him for a brother-in-law; for he is a handsome looking man, and is perfect from top to bottom; and he is just like you. We therefore made up our mind that it would be proper that you take him as your husband.” When the sister heard this she was perfectly satisfied, and she expressed her pleasure in accepting the man. We will now go back to Aukelenuiaiku and his god Lonoikoualii. When the four brothers of Namakaokahai returned to their sister, after their offer was accepted by Aukelenuiaiku, his god Lonoikoualii said to him: “These evils and death we have so far been able to overcome; the evils and death that are yet to come which are worse than these are the ones we must be careful about. When we get to the queen, your intended wife’s home, don’t enter the house at once, for it will mean your death; but you must stand outside by the door and you will see for yourself what they intend to do to you. The first person whom you will encounter will be the two women who met us first. If they take compassion on you, then you will be safe. After that the dog will be released, and if you will overcome him, the brothers will be sent out. After these things, they will try to get rid of you by poisoning the food. So you must remember. If they offer you food in the calabash, don’t eat of it, for therein is your death. What you can eat are the melons that are still on the vines, and you must expect this to be your food, meat and water.” The god of Aukelenuiaiku, Lonoikoualii, explained all these things to him in detail and warned him. After imparting these instructions, Lonoikoualii allowed Aukelenuiaiku to go on his way to the home of Namakaokahai. When Aukelenuiaiku arrived at the house, he remained standing by the doorway, where he was greeted by those within. After the greeting they invited Aukelenuiaiku to come inside; but he did not enter; he remained there. By these different things we will see how Aukelenuiaiku’s god was all-powerful, and we will also see how Aukelenuiaiku obeyed all the instructions that were given him."
"Ia Aukelenuiaiku e ku ana ma ka puka o ka hale o Namakaokahai, kuu ia mai la na wahine elua, oia o Upoho, Haapuainanea.

No ka mea, ua waiho ia aku nei na mea ai, imua ona, aohe ona ai.”","While Aukelenuiaiku was standing by the doorway of Namakaokahai’s house, the two women, Upoho and Haapuainanea, were sent for to come to their queen, and when they arrived, Namakaokahai ordered them saying; “Use your power and slay him.” At this command, the two women turned and looked at Aukelenuiaiku. When they saw that it was the young man they had befriended when they were sent out to look for the person the dog was barking at, they were so ashamed that they ran off. Upoho, the one with the form of a rat ran into a hole; Haapuainanea, the lizard woman ran up a tree, and Aukelenuiaiku was saved. After these two, Moela, the watch-dog of the land was sent for, but when it came near to Aukelenuiaiku, he opened his mouth wide showing his teeth and then jumped at Aukelenuiaiku with the [ ] intention of tearing him to pieces, but when he touched Aukelenuiaiku he was killed, reduced to ashes. When the queen saw that her favorite dog was killed, she regretted his death so much that she bowed her head in grief and wept. After the death of her dog, she ordered her four brothers, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana, and commanded them: “Use your power and kill this fellow. Take him and eat him up.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this he entered the house. Upon seeing Aukelenuiaiku, the four brothers of Namakaokahai changed their forms; Kanemoe changed into a rock and he laid at the doorway: Kaneapua changed into a log of wood and laid there: Leapua changed into a coral rock: Kahaumana changed into a hard blue rock. These four brothers did this because they were ashamed of Aukelenuiaiku and they wished to hide themselves. After this Aukelenuiaiku came to where the calabash vine was growing with several green calabashes on the vine; he then took one up and opened it and sat down to have his meal, finding food, meat and water in the green calabash. While Aukelenuiaiku was eating, the brothers of Namakaokahai said to themselves: “How wonderfully all-seeing is that man. He is eating our food. Who has told him where to find it? Food has been placed before him but he would not touch it.” After Aukelenuiaiku had satisfied his hunger and had seen all the things placed before him, the brothers of Namakaokahai stood up in their human forms."
"A pau keia mau mea i ka ike ia e Aukelenuiaiku, alaila, ku mai la na kaikunane o Namakaokahai i luna, me ko lakou mau kino kanaka.

Kaumaha aku la ia ma ke ano o ke akua, e hoolilo ana ia Namakaokahai a me na kaikunane i akua nona, penei: Kahea ae la o Aukelenuiaiku me ka leo nui:","After Aukelenuiaiku had successfully passed through all these trials, he made up his mind to act cunningly. The first thing he did was to make believe that Namakaokahai and her brothers were his gods and therefore prayed to them in a loud voice as follows:"
"“E na aumakua o ka po, na aumakua o ke ao; Namakaokahai, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua, Kahaumana, Upoho, Haapuainanea, Moela, E ola ia’u e ka pii kuahiwi, E ka ae kuahiwi, E ola i ka oukou pulapula, E ola ia’u i kanaka o kai, Eia mai ka ai la, Amama, ua noa.”","“Ye gods of the night, ye gods of the day; Namakaokahai, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua, Kahaumana, Upoho, Haapuainanea, Moela, Give me life, ye trampers of the mountain, Ye climbers of the mountain; Give life to your offspring, Preserve me a man from the lowlands. Here is the food, It is ended; it is released.”"
"Ia Aukelenuiaiku e kaumaha ana i ko lakou mau inoa, he mea akaaka loa ia na lakou, a he mea haohao no hoi i ko lakou lohe ana. Wahi a lakou: “Ua pau loa ko kakou mau inoa i ka loaa ia ia, o kakou iho la no ka paha kona mau akua.” No [ ] keia haohao o lakou i keia mau hana maalea a Aukelenuiaiku, ninau aku la lakou: “O kou mau akua iho la no ia?” “Ae, o ko’u mau akua no ia mai ko’u man kupuna mai, a ko’u mau makua, a loaa mai au.” A lohe lakou i keia mau olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, kena mai la: “E hana hou mai ana oe?” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “He kaao auanei o hoi hou aku, hookahi no kaumaha ana o ke ’kua o ka pono, no ka mea, o ka’u wale no ia e pau nei i ke ’kua:","When Aukelenuiaiku was offering prayers to the several gods, calling them by their respective names in a loud voice, they all laughed and were surprised at hearing all this; they said to themselves: “He knows all our names, and it does seem that we are his gods.” Being much surprised at the action of Aukelenuiaiku, they asked [ ] him: “Are the gods that you have just mentioned your gods?” “Yes, they are my gods handed down from my ancestors to my parents, and from them to me.” When they heard these words, they asked him that he offer them the same prayers again. Aukelenuiaiku then replied: “If it was a story it would be all right to repeat it, but being a prayer to the gods it would not do to repeat it, because, so far it is only from my side that offerings have been made:"
"“Make ke kanaka, kau i luna o ka lele, Make ka puaa, kau i luna o ka lele, Make ka ilio, ka moa, kau i luna o ka lele, Ka maia, ka awa, kau i luna o ka lele, Ka niu, ka ia ula, kau i luna o ka lele.","“Men have been killed and placed on the altar. Pigs have been killed and placed on the altar. Dogs and chickens have been killed and placed on the altar. Bananas and awa have been placed on the altar, Coconuts and red fish have been placed on the altar."
"O keia mau mea a pau loa, he kau wale no i luna o ka lele na ke ’kua, aole au i ike i ka pomaikai a ke ’kua ia’u, ina paha he hanai i kekahi kanaka, ina ua ola na iwi.”","“All these things have I placed on the altar as offerings to my gods, whose names I have just enumerated, but so far I have not received anything in return from them. If these things had been given to some human being, my bones would have been cared for.”"
"Ma keia mau olelo maalea a Aukelenuiaiku, ua loaa mai ia ia ka pomaikai a me ka pono, a ua pakele oia i ka make a Namakaokahai. I ka lohe ana o ua poe kaikunane nei o Namakaokahai i keia mau olelo maalea a Aukelenuiaiku, olelo mai la lakou: “I keia la e ike ai oe i ka pono a ke ’kua, a e uku ia ai kau malama ana, a e hoi ai kou mau lilo a pau loa.”","By these cunning words Aukelenuiaiku received certain benefits, and in time was saved from certain death prepared by Namakaokahai. When the brothers of Namakaokahai heard these words spoken by Aukelenuiaiku, they replied: “Today you will receive your proper dues from the gods in payment for all the good you have faithfully done them, and you shall be paid in full.”"
"Alaila, olelo mai la na kaikunane o Namakaokahai ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E! auhea oe, e hoolohe mai oe i keia mau olelo.

[ ]","The brothers of Namakaokahai then said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Where are you? Listen to these instructions. In case your wife should call you to come to her, don’t do it, for it will mean your death. If she should ask that you come to the door, don’t go, for that too will mean death to you. If she should ask you to come onto the lounge made of mats, don’t go up, for that too means your death. You must, therefore, go and sit by the doorway, and when she finds that you will not respond to her call, she will come to you at the door. If she should ask you to sleep with her, don’t give your consent, for you will get killed; but you sit on her breast and give a sigh, and when she asks of you why you sighed, tell her that you are hungry for something to eat; and if she should order you to come and get something to eat, obey her, for your wife is a goddess and not a human being.” These admonitions were satisfactory to Aukelenuiaiku. In all these things we know that Aukelenuiaiku after all received some good in return for the offerings he pretended to have made to the gods, for in the end he won Namakaokahai and she became his wife.

While she was with child, one day Aukelenuiaiku and his wife went in bathing, and while they were bathing Aukelenuiaiku went over to where his box was left, as was his custom, to see his god. As he was approaching the place he heard his god Lonoikoualii calling to him: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, we are going to be killed. Here comes Halulu, the man-eating bird from heaven.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard the call he turned and looked up to heaven."
"Ua paapu ka malamalama o ka la i na eheu o Halulu. A pau ka Aukelenuiaiku nana ana i luna, lalau aku la ia i ka pahu o kona akua, o Lonoikoualii. Ia ia e lalau ana a paa aku ka lima i ka pahu, ia wa loaa ke poo o Aukelenuiaiku ia Halulu, a komo i kona waha, a lawe ia aku la i luna o ka pali.

After looking at the bird for some time he reached down and picked up his box which contained his god Lonoikoualii. While in the act of picking up the box, and his hands had just come in contact with it, his head was caught in the mouth of the bird Halulu and he was carried up to the cliff. In the side of this cliff was a cave which was the home of the bird. Aukelenuiaiku was carried up and left there. In the cave at this time were four men who had been carried there by the bird to serve as food. When Aukelenuiaiku was left at the cave they greeted him and took pity on him, for they knew that he would be killed by the bird Halulu. While the men were talking by themselves, Aukelenuiaiku asked them: “What are you talking about?” “We are expressing our regrets—for you are such a handsome fellow—for you will be killed and eaten up by the bird.” Aukelenuiaiku then asked the men: “How does the bird come to get its victims?” “The right wing comes in first and reaches out for two men, and after they are devoured the left wing will come in and take up two more men, then the beak will come down and devour them.” “Which two men will the bird come for first?” Two of the men replied: “We will be the first.” “Is the cave very deep?” “Yes, it is quite deep.” Aukelenuiaiku then instructed the men, saying: “You two go in as far as you can and remain there, so that when the wing reaches in for you two, I will cut it off here at the mouth of the cave, while these two will start the fire.”"
"Ia lakou e kamailio ana no na mea e pili ana i ka make o ua manu nei, komo ana ka eheu akau o ua manu nei, kokolo aku la a loaa ua mau kanaka nei i loko lilo o ke ana, umii mai la ka eheu a paa ua mau kanaka nei. A makaukau ka eheu e lawe mai ia laua, kahea mai laua ia Aukelenuiaiku: “Eia maua i luna o ka eheu kahi i kau ai.” A lohe o Aukelenuiaiku, wehe ae la ia i ka pahu, lalau iho la i ke koi, a ooki iho la i ka eheu o ua manu nei, a moku iho la. A moku ka eheu akau, iho mai la ka eheu hema, ooki iho la no o Aukelenuiaiku, moku, kiola no keia mau kanaka i loko o ke ahi; mahope o ka moku ana o na eheu, iho mai la ka nuku, ooki aku ana o Aukelenuiaiku, kaawale ke poo me ke kino. [ ]","While they were talking about killing the bird, in came the right wing of the bird and it began stretching further and further into the cave until it reached the two men, then it grabbed them. When the wing was about to be drawn to the body with the two men, they called out to Aukelenuiaiku: “Here we are on the wing of the bird.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this he opened his box, took out the axe and began cutting the wing of the bird until it was severed. As soon as the right wing was cut the left wing reached into the cave, when Aukelenuiaiku cut that wing off also, and the men took it up and threw it into the fire. After the two wings had been cut off, the beak reached into the cave and that too was cut off, clean from the body. [ ]"
"A make ua manu nei o Halulu, huhuki ae la ia i na hulu ma ke poo o ua manu la, a kiola mai la i lalo. O keia hulu i huhuki ia ai e Aukelenuiaiku, lele mai la ia a ma ke alo o Namakaokahai, ike iho la ia, o na hulu i ke poo o ka manu, o Halulu.","After the bird Halulu was killed, he pulled a few feathers out of the bird’s head and threw them to the ground away from the cliff. These feathers that were pulled by Aukelenuiaiku flew until they fell in the very presence of Namakaokahai, where they were seen by her and recognized as the head feathers of the bird Halulu."
"Maanei, e kamailio uuku kakou no ka manu a me Namakaokahai, i ko laua pili ana ma ke kumu. He kaikunane o Halulu manu, no Namakaokahai, ke ’lii wahine o ka aina o Kalakeenuiakane. A ike o Namakaokahai ua make o Halulu, kona kaikunane, kahea aku la ia i kona mau kaikunane, ia Kanemoe, Leapua, Kahaumana, Kaneapua. I aku o Namakaokahai ia lakou: “Eia o Hinawaikolii, na hulu i ka lae o Halulu, ua make, ua pepehi ia.” A lohe na kaikunane, olelo aku la ia Namakaokahai: “Ua pono no ia ke make, no ka mea, he hana ino kana, he ai i ke kanaka.”","We will now take up the relationship between the bird and Namakaokahai, for they were connected. The bird Halulu was a cousin to Namakaokahai, the queen of the land of Kalakeenuiakane. When Namakaokahai saw that her cousin Halulu was dead she called for her brothers, Kanemoe, Leapua, Kahaumana and Kaneapua. When they came to her she said to them: “Here are Hinawaikoli, the feathers from the forehead of Halulu, who is dead. He has been killed.” When the brothers heard this, they said to Namakaokahai: “It is quite right that the bird should be killed, because he is an evil thing, he eats men.”"
"Ma keia make ana o ua manu nei ia Aukelenuiaiku, okioki iho la lakou i ka io, a koala aku la i luna o ke ahi, a ai iho la lakou. Mahope o laila, imi iho la lakou i alanui e hoi ai i lalo nei, aka, e noho ana ia wa, ko Halulu lua, he manu no, o Kiwaha ka inoa. Haawi mai la ia ia Aukelenuiaiku i alanui.

After their meal was finished, they began to study how to get down from the cliff. At this time there was another bird in the cave, the mate of Halulu, by the name of Kiwaha. This bird gave Aukelenuiaiku the means of getting down the cliff, by giving him a short-ended rainbow, one with only three colors, yellow, red and green. By means of this rainbow they reached the bottom of the cliff. In thus getting away successfully, the four men were thankful to Aukelenuiaiku, for they knew that they were rescued from a terrible death, and so they were very grateful for the kindness shown them."
"A hiki o Aukelenuiaiku i lalo me na kanaka, lawe ae la o Kiwaha i ke alanui anuenue i ka pali, mahope o laila, ninau aku o Aukelenuiaiku i na kanaka: “Heaha ka oukou mau mea ono?” I mai lakou: “He ko ka’u, he uwala ka’u, he maia ka’u, he kalo ka’u.” Olelo aku o Aukelenuiaiku ia lakou: “He kapu ke ko na kuu keiki, ina e ai, o kona manawa ia e make ai, pela ka uala, ka maia, ke kalo, nolaila, mai noho oukou a lalau i keia mau mea a pau loa ke hele kakou ma ke alanui, o make oukou.” A pau ke ao ana o Aukelenuiaiku ia lakou, alaila, hele aku la lakou.

After this Aukelenuiaiku asked the men: “What do you want?” They each answered: “I want a piece of sugar-cane.” “I want a potato.” “I want a banana.” “I want a taro.” Aukelenuiaiku then said to them: “The sugar-cane is kapued for my son. If any one eats it he will die. So are the potatoes, the bananas and the taro. So I will advise each of you not to touch these things as we go on our way, else you will all die.” After giving them this advice they all started out. On the way, however, the men did not adhere to the advice given them by Aukelenuiaiku, for he who wanted the sugar-cane took a piece and ate it, so he died; the other three men also took up the things they craved for and they also died. Thus did the four men die, for not keeping the advice given them by Aukelenuiaiku."
"A pau lakou i ka lilo i ka make, koe iho la o Aukelenuiaiku, hoi aku la ia a hiki i ka hale, ike mai la ka wahine me na kaikoeke, uwe mai la, a halawai ae la lakou me ka oluolu aloha.

Nolaila, haawi mai la o Namakaokahai, kana wahine i ka ea o ka aina, a me na mea a pau loa i loko o ko Aukelenuiaiku lima, a me kona mau kino ano akua kekahi.","After the death of the four men, Aukelenuiaiku continued on by himself until he reached the house. When the wife and the brothers-in-law saw Aukelenuiaiku, they all wept for joy and he was welcomed home. After this, Aukelenuiaiku and his wife lived on happily, each determined to love each other more and more. The wife [ ] had no other thoughts but of the comfort of her husband. They continued living this way for some time. Because of this great love for her husband, Namakaokahai gave over the kingdom to her husband, as well as everything else at her command; and she even gave him the command and the use of her supernatural bodies."
"I kekahi la, komo aku la o Aukelenuiaiku i loko o ka hale e ai ai, ia ia e ai ana’ wehe malu ae la o Namakaokahai i ka pahu o ke ’kua o Aukelenuiaiku, a nana iho la i loko, e waiho ana ke koi a me ka pahi i loko, lalau iho la ia ma ka oi o ke koi a hamo iho la, moku ae la ka lima, a kahe ke koko, nolaila, pane iho la o Namakaokahai: “Kupanaha! he mea maikai no ka hoi ka kuu kane e huna nei;” a pau kona nana ana, huna iho la ia. A pau ka ai ana o Aukelenuiaiku, hoi mai la ia a noho.

Looking in she saw the axe and the knife. She then took up the axe and ran her fingers over the edge, cutting her fingers so they bled. Namakaokahai then said: “How strange! here my husband has some very good things which he is hiding from me!” After looking over these things she closed the box and put it away. When Aukelenuiaiku finished his meal he returned and sat down. Namakaokahai then asked him, pretending not to have seen what was in the box, saying: “Say, what useful things did you bring with you when you came?” Aukelenuiaiku then picked up the box and opening it, he took out the axe and knife and gave them over to his wife, saying: “These two things which I have brought with me from the land of Kuaihelani are very good and useful. These two things together with my god are the three things of the greatest value.” The wife then asked him: “What are these things good for?” “The axe will cut a log of wood in two. The knife is also useful, for it can cut any tough thing you have.” When Namakaokahai heard this she said to her husband: “Say, your valuable things together with mine we will leave with our child.”"
"Ma keia wahi aku, e ike kakou i ka mana o Namakaokahai, a me kona make ole i nei mea oi o ke koi, a e maopopo no auanei ia kakou he ano aku no kona. A pau ko laua kamailio ana no ke koi a me ka pahi, olelo aku o Namakaokahai i kana kane ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E oki mai oe ia’u i ke koi.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Kupanaha oe! o oe no ka’u wahine ponoi, a pehea la wau e ooki aku ai ia oe, a make iho; e aho, i ke kanaka e au e ooki ai i ke koi a moku, a i ole ia he hoa hakaka, aole o oe o ko’u io ponoi.” I mai ka wahine: “Kahaha! e haawi hoi paha auanei oe i ke koi ia hai, lilo hoi ka mea maikai a ka kaua keiki, nolaila, e hoao mai no oe ia’u.” A no ko Namakaokahai paakiki loa, ae aku kana kane; ma keia ae ana o kana kane, ua lilo ia i mea oluolu loa ia Namakaokahai. Mahope o keia ae ana o Aukelenuiaiku e ooki aku ia Namakaokahai i ke koi, hoolei loa aku la na wawae o Namakaokahai a pololei, ooki iho la o Aukelenuiaiku i ke koi.","Further on in our story we will see the supernatural powers of Namakaokahai, and how it was impossible to kill her, although she was cut up with the axe; by which acts we will know that she was not human. After talking about the axe and knife, Namakaokahai said to her husband: “You proceed and cut me into pieces with the axe.” Aukelenuiaiku said: “How strange of you to ask me to do such a thing as to cut you up, my own wife! How can I do such a thing, for it will mean your death? Rather let me cut up some other person with this axe, or my opponent in some fight, not you, my own flesh.” The wife replied: “You might give this axe to someone else and thus deprive our child of such a useful thing. Therefore I want you to try it on me.” And because Namakaokahai insisted on it, the husband finally gave in, whereat she was much pleased. When this consent was given Namakaokahai stretched out her legs and Aukelenuiaiku severed them with the axe."
"A pau loa ke kino o Namakaokahai i ka moku i ke koi a Aukelenuiaiku, ninau ae la ke poo o Namakaokahai ia Aukelenuiaiku: “Ea! pau ae la kau mea maikai e ke kane?” “Ae, ua pau loa ae la, no ka mea, a moku keia mea he kanaka, he make kona hope.” Mahope o keia olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, pane mai o Namakaokahai: “Ae, pau ae la kau mea maikai, o ka’u mea maikai koe.” Ma keia olelo a Namakaokahai, hoi ae la kona kino a hui ma kahi mua, pela na wahi a pau loa i kaawale, a ola ae la ia e like me mamua.

Alaila, oili ae la o Namakaokahai a ku ana maluna o ka welau o ka pali, a nana iho i ke kane me ka ninau iho: “E aha ana oe?” I aku ke kane: “E mahalo iho ana au, o kau mea maikai, o ka’u mea maikai, na ka kaua keiki ia.” Ma keia olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, he kanaaho wale ae no, he makau kona e noho ana.","After the body of Namakaokahai had been cut up into several pieces, the head asked of Aukelenuiaiku: “Are these all the useful things my husband brought with him?” “Yes, these are all; and I am surprised at you, for when a person is cut up in this manner, death is certain.” Namakaokahai then replied: “If these are all the useful things you have, I will now show you what I have.” Saying this, the pieces began to get together of their own accord, and in a short space of time the body was again complete and restored as before. She then called for her four brothers, Kaneapua, Kanemoe, Leapua and Kahaumana. Upon their arrival the sister asked them: “What shall I change myself into? Shall it be into a cliff?” Her brothers then answered: “Yes, change yourself into a cliff.” At that very moment a great, high cliff stood before them, smooth and straight up and down, where the koae was seen flying. Aukelenuiaiku looked at it and touched its smooth sides with his hands with fear and great excitement. He next saw Namakaokahai, his wife, standing on the very top of the cliff; then he saw her looking down at him, and she called: “What are you doing?” The husband replied: “I am admiring your supernatural powers. Your useful things together with mine will be a great inheritance for our child.” In making this reply, Aukelenuiaiku made believe that he was not afraid; but in fact he was almost overcome with fear."
"Ia Namakaokahai e ku ana i luna o ka pali, kahea iho la i na kaikunane ona eha: “E aha la wau, e kai paha?” Ae aku na kaikunane, “ae, e kai oe.” Lilo ae la ka aina i kai, he nalu ma na wahi a pau loa, aohe wahi kaawale i koe, a o Aukelenuiaiku, i loko o ka manawa e poi nei ka nalu, oili ae la o Namakaokahai, a ninau mai la i ke kane: “E Aukelenuiaiku, e aha ana oe?” I aku ke kane: “E mahalo ae ana au i keia mea maikai au.”","While Namakaokahai was standing there on the cliff, she called out to her four brothers and said: “What shall I change myself into now? Shall it be into an ocean?” The brothers replied: “Yes, change yourself into a vast ocean.” At that very moment the whole cliff dissolved and turned into a great ocean, with its surface covered with mighty waves, so completely that nothing else could be seen. Aukelenuiaiku was at this time being engulfed by the water and he was sore afraid, but at the appearance of Namakaokahai and questioned by her, “What are you doing?” he replied: “I am admiring your great powers.”"
"A mahope o ke kai, kuu iho la o Namakaokahai i ke kino ahi ona, pau ae la ka aina i ke ahi a puni, aohe wahi i koe. A o ke kane hoi o Aukelenuiaiku, aia i loko o ka lapalapa o ke ahi kahi i noho ai. Alaila, ninau iho ka wahine: “E aha ana oe e Aukelenuiaiku?” “E mahalo ae ana au i keia mea maikai au o ke ahi.” [ ]","After the ocean, Namakaokahai changed herself into a terrible fire and the land was enveloped in flame, covering the whole surface as far as the eye could see. Aukelenuiaiku was entirely surrounded by the fire, in the midst of which he saw his wife and heard her asking him, saying: “What are you doing, Aukelenuiaiku?” He replied: “I am still admiring your great powers and the fire.” [ ]"
"O keia mau mea ekolu, o ka pali, o ke kai, o ke ahi he mau kino lakou no Namakaokahai, ma kona ano akua, koe nae ke kino lele ona, ua haawi aku ia i kana kane. A o ke kino lele o Namakaokahai, ua aua ia i kana kane, aole i haawi aku, no kona manao, o lele auanei, nele ia i ke kane ole, nolaila, aua ia. Aka, o na kaikunane ona, ua manao lakou e hoike malu i ko lakou kaikoeke ia kino.","These three things, the cliff, the ocean and the fire were the three supernatural bodies of Namakaokahai, and she gave to her husband the power to change himself into these three different things. She, however, did not reveal her fourth form and power, the power to fly through space. The reason why she did not reveal this fourth power to her husband and did not wish him to possess it, was because she was afraid that he might take it into his mind to fly away and deprive her of him, so she thought she would keep this power to herself. The brothers, however, did not approve of this, and decided to teach their brother-in-law secretly how to acquire this power."
"Maanei, e hoolohe kakou i na olelo ninau a na kaikoeke o Aukelenuiaiku eha, a e nana kakou i ko lakou aloha i ko lakou kaikoeke, a e hoomanao iho i na olelo mua i hala, penei: “I keia la e ike ai oe i ka pono o ke ’kua.” Ninau mai la na kaikoeke o Aukelenuiaiku: “Ea! ua haawi mai anei ko wahine ia oe i na kino ona a pau loa?” “Ae,” pela o Aukelenuiaiku. “Na kino hea ka mea a ko wahine i haawi mai ai ia oe?” “O ke kino pali, o ke kino kai, o ke kino ahi.” I aku na kaikoeke: “Aole i pau loa mai la na kino o ko wahine, koe aku la ke kino lele ia oe.” “Ae, ua aua kuu wahine ia mea, aole i haawi mai ia’u.” I aku na kaikoeke: “No ka manao o ko wahine, o lele loa oe a nalowale, aole e hoi hou mai, nolaila, aua kela.” Mahope o keia mau olelo i aku na kaikoeke: “E ao kakou ia oe, i ke kino lele o ko wahine, i ike oe, eia nae, mai olelo oe i ko wahine.”","We will here see how the four brothers-in-law of Aukelenuiaiku gave him the power to fly, in payment for the offerings made by him to the gods. Some time after this his brothers-in-law said to him: “Today you will realize the blessings of the deity.” After a while he was asked: “Say, has your wife given you the power to change yourself into different forms?” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “Yes.” “What different forms did she give you?” “The power to change into a cliff, into an ocean, and into fire.” The brothers-in-law replied: “Then she has not given you all her powers. She has kept to herself the power to fly.” “Yes, my wife has reserved that; she did not give it to me.” The brothers-in-law continued, saying: “It is because your wife thought you might fly off and never come back again. That is the reason why she has kept this power from you.” After this the brothers-in-law said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Let us teach you how to get this flying power of your wife, so that you may be able to possess it. But you must not tell your wife of this.”"

They first taught him how to jump and how to fly to certain places; then they asked him to jump to the top of a shelf. After he was successful in this he was requested to jump to the top roof batten of the house. Aukelenuiaiku then jumped and held it for a while, then fell to the floor. In this falling, Namakaokahai heard it, and she got up and came to her brothers’ house, and asked them: “What are you doing?” “We are learning how to box.” “What is that?” “It is played this way. Kanemoe stands up like this on this side, and Kaneapua stands up on that side; then they strike at each other, and the one who gets hit real hard falls to the floor. That was the noise you heard.” When Namakaokahai heard this she said: “I see that my husband has some good thing hidden that he has not shown me. How mysterious you are!” After this Namakaokahai returned to her own house. After she disappeared, Aukelenuiaiku again made another attempt to reach the top batten, but again he was unsuccessful and he fell to the floor. [ ] Namakaokahai again heard this and she came to her brothers’ house and asked them: “I believe you are teaching my husband how to fly.” “No, we are wrestling.” “How is that done?” “One stands up on this side, and one on the other side; they then take ahold of one another and each tries to throw the other down. The one who is thrown down made the noise you heard.” Because of this satisfactory reply Namakaokahai again retired to their house. After she was gone, Aukelenuiaiku again made another attempt and this time he was successful. He next came out and flew to the top of the house, and in this he was again successful. From the roof Aukelenuiaiku flew up into the sky, and he went so high that his brothers-in-law were unable to see him. After a while Aukelenuiaiku returned to the ground and his brothers-in-law said to him: “Yes, you know how to fly now.”"
"Ia laua e noho pu ana, he kane a he wahine, ua aaki ke aloha me ka hoopaa i ko laua mau kino, a ua akaka loa ka hapai keiki o kana wahine akua, o Namakaokahai.

After this the two lived on in peace and they never went out of sight of each other; they were indeed a loving couple. It also became apparent that Namakaokahai, his god-wife, was with child. Before its birth, however, Namakaokahai made known to her husband the name of the child: it was Kauwilanuimakehaikalani (the lightning which we see in a rain-storm). Aukelenuiaiku, however, wished to have the child called after the name of his god Lonoikoualii."
"A no ka nui loa o ko Namakaokahai aloha i ke kane, ia Aukelenuiaiku, nolaila, pili paa loa laua, i ke kau a me ka hooili, i ka la a me ka ua, i ka wa wi a me ka wa maona, i ka po a me ke ao, i na la a pau loa.

They were together constantly, at all seasons and times, in dry and wet weather, in times of famine and of plenty, in the daytime and at night, in fact they were together all the time. Namakaokahai also gave all her possessions to Aukelenuiaiku; from the things that were above to the things below; from the things in the uplands to the things in the lowlands; great things and small things; the things that were within to the things that were without. All were given to her husband."

Ua hooili au i na mea a pau no kuu kane. O luna, o lalo, o uka, o kai, o ka hao pae, o ke meki ku i ka honua, o ka palaoa, o ka ea makaulii, o ka maulele i ka aina, o ka huhui hoku.

Ma keia wahi a kakou e hoolohe nei, e noonoo iho kakou me ka manao oiaio, i luna o ka lani, keia lele ana o Aukelenuiaiku me na kaikoeke.","When Namakaokahai was ready to give everything she possessed to her husband, Aukelenuiaiku, she called her brothers, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana. As they stood in her presence, she said to them: “You go up to my uncle and cousin, Kuwahailo and Makalii, and inform them that I have given unto my husband all my possessions. The things above, below, in the uplands, in the lowlands, the drift iron, the iron that stands in the earth, the whale’s tooth, the (ea) turtle shell, the things that grow in the land, and the cluster of stars. Also, tell my uncle and cousin [ ] that all these things are now in my husband’s possession; and I also want you to take my husband to them so that they may become acquainted with each other.” All these words of Namakaokahai were pleasing to them. We must bear in mind that this trip to be undertaken by the brothers of Namakaokahai and Aukelenuiaiku was to heaven."
"Mahope o ko Namakaokahai olelo ana mai ia lakou, lele aku la lakou a ke kua , hiwi hoomaha, ma ia lele hookahi ana, ua hala aku o Aukelenuiaiku i ka lani. Ma keia lele ana o Aukelenuiaiku, hiki mua aku la ia i kahi o kana wahine, o Namakaokahai, he wahi kapu loa ia, aohe mea hele ma laila. Ia Aukelenuiaiku e ku ana ma kahi kapu o Namakaokahai, nana aku la o Kuwahailo, a olelo iho i loko ona: “Auwe! make kuu kaikamahine, ke hiki nei ke kupu i luna nei, no ka mea, aohe kanaka nana e pii mai o luna nei, hiki no ke kanaka, ua make o lalo.”","After Namakaokahai had delivered her orders to her brothers, they began their flight, going as far as the top of the mountains where they rested. In this first flight Aukelenuiaiku went on to heaven, reaching his wife’s place, a most sacred sphere, not accessible to anyone. Although they flew at the same time with Aukelenuiaiku, he got ahead of his brothers-in-law and arrived in heaven first. While Aukelenuiaiku was standing in the sacred place of Namakaokahai, he was seen by Kuwahailo, who said to himself: “Alas! I am afraid my niece is dead; that is why a wizard has arrived, for no one can get up here unless those below are dead.”"
"Ma keia lele ana o Aukelenuiaiku i luna i ka lani, aole ona manao he kaua, a he hakaka, ua lele oia me ka nanea walewale. Aka, maloko o ka olelo a kona akua ia ia, a Lonoikoualii, he kaua, penei na olelo: “E Aukelenuiaiku e! make kaua, eia la he kaua ko luna nei. E aahu oe i ko kapa lehu mai ko poo a ko manea wawae, mai lohi oe o make auanei.” Ma keia mau olelo a ke ’kua ia Aukelenuiaiku, ma laila i maopopo ai he kaua ko luna. Mahope o ka olelo a ke ’kua ia Aukelenuiaiku, oili mai la ka momoku ahi mai loko mai o ka lima o Kuwahailo a a ana i ka honua. O ka inoa o ua momoku ahi la, o Kukuena, a mahope ona kuu ia mai la ka pohaku o Ikuwa, he pohaku koeleele, oia ka hekili. A pa keia mau mea i ke kapa lehu o Aukelenuiaiku, he mea ole laua, he opala, he mea uhauha na ka makani. Ma keia moolelo, ua olelo ia, i ka wa i pa ai ka hekili i ke kapa lehu o Aukelenuiaiku, nolaila mai ka nakeke o ka hekili a hiki i keia la.","In this flight to heaven, Aukelenuiaiku did not think that he was going to meet anyone who would oppose him, and consequently he went along unguarded; but through the powers of his god Lonoikoualii he was warned in time, for the god called out to him: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, watch or else we will be killed, for I see that we are going to be attacked. Put on your garment of ashes and cover yourself from head to feet; don’t be slow or we will be killed.” By this warning Aukelenuiaiku knew that a conflict was about to begin, and he immediately put on his war pau. As soon as his god finished giving the warning a bolt of fire was sent out from the hand of Kuwahailo and the land began to be in flames. The name of this bolt of fire was Kukuena. After which a large black rock was sent out, called Ikuwa, the thunder. When these things came in contact with the robe of ashes of Aukelenuiaiku, they became as nothing, like chaff and were blown away by the wind."
"A mao ae la ka momoku ahi a me ka pohaku, nana aku la o Kuwahailo ia Aukelenuiaiku, e ku mai ana no, aole i make. He mea kaumaha loa ia i ko Kuwahailo manao ana, a he mea inoino loa i kona ike ana aku e oia mai ana kona enemi, ke ahikanana o Kuaihelani. Ia wa, kuu hou o Kuwahailo i ka lua o ka momoku ahi, oia o Mahuia, a kuu hou i ka lua o ka pohaku, oia o Welehu, o ka lua ia o na hekili ikaika loa, nakeke, opaipai ka lani, naueue na kukulu o ka honua, haki kaikoo o ka moana, nakaka na pohaku, kahako ka pali, lele ke koae. I ka pa ana i ke kapa lehu o Aukelenuiaiku, ua lilo ia i mea ole, heaha la kona ano, he puahiohio paha.","In this story it was said that when the thunderbolt came in contact with the garment of Aukelenuiaiku it caused the roaring and rumbling of the thunder which is heard to this day. After the bolt of fire was extinguished and the rock became as nothing, Kuwahailo looked at Aukelenuiaiku and lo, he was still in the place where he saw him, still alive. This grieved Kuwahailo heavily: it bode dire trouble that his enemy, the defiant of Kuaihelani, should stand alive before him. After a time he sent another bolt of fire, called Mahuia, and another rock, called Welehu, the second strongest bolt of thunder. The roar was deafening, the heaven rocked, the foundations of the earth were shaken, the waves of the ocean rose high as mountains, large rocks were loosened from the cliffs, the cliffs were opened up and the birds on the mountain heights were alarmed. When these came in contact with the robe of ashes of Aukelenuiaiku they became as nothing, like a gust of wind."
"A hala keia make a Kuwahailo, i nana aku ka hana i ka oioi o Kuaihelani, e ku mai ana no, aole i make, i iho o Kuwahailo: “Ka! akahi no ka make ole o nei kanaka, no ka mea, o ka pau no keia o na mea make, aohe make iho.” [ ]","After these death aims of Kuwahailo he again looked and saw Aukelenuiaiku standing in the same place, and still alive. Kuwahailo then said to himself: “Here I have exhausted all my death-dealing weapons and still that man is not killed yet. This is the first man that has been able to withstand all this.” [ ]"
"Maanei e hoomaha iki kakou i ka hoolohe ana no Kuwahailo, a me Aukelenuiaiku, a e kamailio kakou no na kaikunane o Namakaokahai, na kaikoeke o Aukelenuiaiku . Ma keia lele ana o lakou mai ka honua ae a ka lani, ua pakeu aku ko Aukelenuiaiku lele i ko na kaikoeke.

Ninau mai ko lakou makuakane: “Pehea ko oukou kaikuahine?” “Aia no ke noho la.” “A nohea hoi nei kanaka kupua?” “O ko hunona ia o ke kane ia a Namakaokahai.” A lohe o Kuwahailo i keia olelo a na keiki, ku iho la ia me ka makau a me ka haalulu, a noonoo iho la ia i kana mea e hana aku ai ia Aukelenuiaiku, ka ihu kaeaea o Kuaihelani. I aku la ia i kana hunona: “E, i mua ou wau i hana aku ai i ka hewa, a me ka pono ole, a nolaila, ke waiho aku nei au i ka mohai i mua ou, elua lau kanaka (ewalu haneri ia).” A hiki o Kuwahailo me na lau kanaka elua i mua o Aukelenuiaiku, ninau mai o Aukelenuiaiku: “He kanaka aha keia?” Olelo mai kona makuahunowai: “He mohai ia oe.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Ua oki ke kanaka no ka moopuna, a no ka aina no hoi.”","We will here leave Aukelenuiaiku and Kuwahailo for a time while we take up the brothers of Namakaokahai. In making their flight from the earth to heaven, they saw that Aukelenuiaiku was going much faster than they were. The length of time they took on this voyage was five days and five nights, while Aukelenuiaiku covered the distance in only one day and one night: hence, when Kuwahailo was pouring out his death-dealing bolts, the brothers were still on their way. When they were approaching heaven, and saw from a distance the fire-bolt called Kukuena, and the black rock Ikuwa being hurled at Aukelenuiaiku, they all cried out in alarm, for they thought their brother-in-law would be killed. They then flew to a rocky valley and there laid down; after the fire and the roar of the thunder had gone by they came out, and when they looked they saw Aukelenuiaiku still standing. They then called to him to come and hide himself between the rocks in the valley, for they knew that other death-dealing bolts were yet to come; but Aukelenuiaiku answered them: “You stay there where you are while I remain here until I shall kill Kuwahailo.” As soon as the last death-bolt had passed by, the nephews of Kuwahailo came out and stood in the presence of their uncle. He then asked them: “How is your sister?” “She is at home.” “And whence comes this wizard?” “That is your nephew, the husband of Namakaokahai.” When Kuwahailo heard this from his nephews, he stood there in fear and trembling, and wondered what he was to do to his nephew Aukelenuiaiku, the hero of Kuaihelani. After a pause of some time he said to Aukelenuiaiku: “My nephew, I have indeed sinned against you, for I have this day treated you unkindly. I will therefore make an offering before you of eight hundred men.” When Kuwahailo returned with his eight hundred men, and they stood before Aukelenuiaiku, Aukelenuiaiku turned to Kuwahailo and asked him: “What are these men for?” His uncle replied: “They are my offerings to you.” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “Leave the men for your grandnephew and as people for the land.”"
"Mahope o laila, hai aku la na keiki ia Kuwahailo: “He olelo ka makou i hoouna ia mai nei e ko kaikamahine e hai aku ia oe.” Ninau aku o Kuwahailo: “Heaha kana olelo ia oukou?” Eia kana olelo ia makou: “O luna, o lalo, o uka, o kai, maluna ko hunona, malalo aku oe e noho ai, a me na mea a pau loa.” Ma keia mau olelo a na keike he mea oluolu loa ia i ko Kuwahailo manao, ae mahope o keia olelo ana, ahaolelo iho la lakou. Ma keia ahaolelo ana, hele mai la o Makalii e halawai me Aukelenuiaiku. Ma keia hele ana mai o Makalii, hele pu mai la me kana wahine me Malanaikuaheahea.","After this the brothers-in-law of Aukelenuiaiku delivered their message, saying: “We have been sent by your niece to bring you a message.” Kuwahailo then asked: “What is the message?” “She told us to tell you, ‘that the things above, below, in the uplands, in the lowlands, are your [new] relative’s: you will live under him: everything has been given to this man,’ her husband.” This was agreeable to Kuwahailo. After this, they all sat down and held a council. In the council, Makalii came and met Aukelenuiaiku. In coming to meet Aukelenuiaiku, Makalii also brought his wife, Malanaikuaheahea."
"Maanei e kamailio uuku no ka wahine a Makalii. O keia wahine o Malanaikuaheahea, he wahine maikai a me ka nani loa, o kona kino ke nana aku, ua like me ka ula o ke ahi ka ula. I kona ku ana a hele mai kona hale noho mai, ua paku ia ka malamalama o ka la, a pouli, nee mai la ka uakoko, uhi mai la ka ohu, kokolo mai la ka noe, halii mai la ke awa, kahe mai la ka wai ula, olapa ka uila.

O ka la, ua pau ia ma hope ona, o ke anuenue malalo o kona mau wawae. A ike o Aukelenuiaiku i keia mau mea a pau i mua ona, a me ka wahine a Makalii, ua maule kona manao, ua poniuniu kona lunaikehala, a ua maule kona noonoo kanaka, nolaila, olelo o Aukelenuiaiku, e hoi i lalo nei.","We will here speak a few words about the wife of Makalii. This woman, Malanaikuaheahea, was a very beautiful woman. Her skin, to look upon her, was red as fire. On coming out of her house, her beauty overshadowed the rays of the sun, so that darkness covered the land, and the red rain would be seen approaching; the fog would also come, and after these things had been seen the fine rain would come, then the red waters would flow and the lightning would play in the heavens. After these things, then the form of Malanaikuaheahea would be seen coming along over the tips [ ] of the fingers of her servants, in all her beauty. Makalii thought a good deal of his wife and he made much of her. The sun was eclipsed by her, and the rainbow was her footstool. When Aukelenuiaiku saw these different things and then the wife of Makalii, he grew faint and dizzy, and could hardly control himself, so he made up his mind to come back to earth."
"A hiki o Aukelenuiaiku i mua o kana wahine a me ka laua keiki noho iho la laua he kane a he wahine, a hala elua malama. Ia wa, moe iho la o Aukelenuiaiku i ke awakea, a i loko o keia moe ana, ike aku la ia ma ka moe uhane i ka uhane o kana keiki, o Kaumaiilunaoholaniku. O keia keiki a Aukelenuiaiku, oia no kela keiki a lakou i holo pu mai ai mai Kuaihelani mai, a kela kaikuaana huhu o Aukelenuiaiku, a Kekamakahinuiaiku. A ike o Aukelenuiaiku i ka uhane o ua keiki la, uwe iho la ia i loko o kona wa hiamoe, a puoho ae la me ia uwe no. Ma keia ala ana, kau mai la ka halialia ia Aukelenuiaiku, no ke keiki a me na kaikuaana, nolaila, uwe hamama ae la ia. Ia Aukelenuiaiku e uwe hamama ana, ninau aku la kana wahine o Namakaokahai: “Heaha hoi kau e uwe nei?” “E uwe ana au i ke aloha i kuu keiki.” “Ua loaa keiki no ka oe?” “Aohe na’u, na ko’u kaikuaana, i ka la a makou i ku mai ai ianei ka make ana. A maloko o kuu moe uhane, ike aku nei au i kona uhane, e pii mai ana mai loko mai o ke kai, oia ka maka mua o na uhane a pau loa.”","When Aukelenuiaiku arrived in the presence of his wife and their child, after an absence of several days, he remained with her for about two months. One day on taking a nap at noontime he fell into a deep sleep and he dreamed a dream in which he saw the spirit of his nephew, Kaumaiilunaoholaniku. This boy was the son of his oldest brother, the boy who accompanied them on the voyage from Kuaihelani, the son of Kekamakahinuiaiku, the brother who had a violent temper. At sight of the spirit of his nephew, Aukelenuiaiku wept in his sleep, and when he awoke he was still crying. Upon waking from his sleep he could not get the effects off his mind and he remembered his nephew and brothers, so he wept aloud. While Aukelenuiaiku was weeping his wife asked him: “What are you crying about?” “I am crying for the love of my child.” “Have you a child, then?” “Not mine, the son of my oldest brother. He died with my brothers on the day our ship arrived here. In my dream I saw his spirit coming up from the bottom of the sea, followed by the spirits of his father and uncles.”"
"A lohe kana wahine i keia mau olelo a kana kane, i mai la ia: “Ua ola ko keiki.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Pehea e ola ai?” I mai kana wahine: “Aia a hoolohe oe i ka’u olelo, alaila, ola ko keiki.” “Pehea au e hoolohe ai?” “E lawe oe i ka ai a me ka ia a waho, i laila oe e ai ai, malama o ike mai ka uhane o ko keiki i ko ai aku, hele mai. A i hiki mai ka uhane o ko keiki i ko alo, mai hopu oe, a i hele a ku ma ko kua mai hopu no oe, aka, i hele mai a noho i luna o ko uha, alaila oe hopu ae, ola ko keiki a me ou kaikuaana, aole e make, no ka mea, e pii ana ka uhane i ke kuahiwi, i ka ai pioia.”","When his wife heard this, she said to her husband: “Your nephew can be saved.” Aukelenuiaiku asked: “How can I bring him back to life?” The wife replied: “Only when you obey my instructions; then, and only then, will your nephew come back to life.” “What is it you wish me to do?” “Take some food and meat with you out of doors and there have your meal. Perchance your nephew’s spirit will see you eating and will come to you. If the spirit does come to you, don’t attempt to catch it, not even if it comes and stands at your back; but if it comes and sits on your lap, then catch it and your nephew and brothers will be restored to life again. Their spirits were on their way to the mountains to gather food.”"
"Mahope o keia mau olelo, hana aku la o Aukelenuiaiku e like me na olelo a kana wahine, ia ia e ai ana launa mai la ka uhane o ke keiki. I aku ka wahine ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E wikiwiki kau ai ana i noho paa mai ka uhane o ko keiki.” Ia Aukelenuiaiku e ai wikiwiki ana, poai mai la ka uhane o ke keiki ma kona mau aoao a pau loa, ma ke kua a ma ke alo. No keia kokoke loa o ka uhane o ua keiki la, hopu aku la o Aukelenuiaiku, ia wa, nalowale ka uhane o ke keiki.

While he was eating, the spirit of his nephew came to him. The wife then said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Be quick with your meal so that the spirit of your nephew will remain with you longer.” While Aukelenuiaiku was eating very fast, the spirit kept on going around him at his back and in front of him. As the spirit came nearer and got quite close to Aukelenuiaiku, Aukelenuiaiku attempted to catch [ ] it; when he did this it disappeared. At this his wife said: “You will not be able to save your nephew now, because you acted too hastily. Had you obeyed my instructions, he would have been brought to life again. Now the spirit of your nephew is dead.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this from his wife, he became down-hearted and believed what his wife told him, that the spirit of his nephew was now beyond recovery. Aukelenuiaiku therefore refused to take food for five days and five nights; he would not touch either food or water, and he denied himself everything, for he was so sorry for his nephew. When Namakaokahai saw her husband refuse to take food she asked him: “Why have you refused to take food?” Her husband replied: “You know quite well why I have refused food, my wife; that is, the spirit of my nephew. I will not take food until my days of grief are over; then I will again take food.”"
"No keia mea, komo mai la ke aloha i loko o ka wahine no kana kane, nolaila, olelo aku la ia i ke kane: “Aia a nui ko ikaika, ola ko keiki, a me ou kaikuaana, aka, i emi ko ikaika, aole e ola ko keiki a me ou kaikuaana.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku i ka wahine: “Heaha ia mea a’u e hana aku ai me ka ikaika?” “O ka wai ola loa a Kane.

If you are able to procure this, then your nephew and brothers will live.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this from his wife he took food and meat; the reason of this was because he heard that it was possible to save his nephew and brothers. After he had taken food, Aukelenuiaiku said to his wife: “Where is the road that will lead me to the water of everlasting life of Kane?” His wife replied: “I will show you the way. From this place where we are standing you must go straight to the rising sun, where you will obtain the water of everlasting life of Kane.”"
"Maanei e ike ai kakou i ko Aukelenuiaiku mana a me kona hele ana i ka aina malihini e huli i ka wai ola a Kane.

The wife then said to her husband: “On this direct line you must go without once departing from it. You must not go towards the right, for you will then be wandering in the sky and die. You must not go to the left of this line, for you will then fall into space and you will be lost. All these instructions you must keep in your mind.” As soon as his wife concluded with her instructions, Aukelenuiaiku took up the box which contained his god Lonoikoualii, put it under his arm and then put on his robe of ashes. When Aukelenuiaiku was ready to proceed on his journey, he fell on his wife’s neck and they kissed each other, and then made his flight toward the rising sun."

At the end of another month she again went out [ ] and looked, and there she saw her husband still flying. She then remained for another month, at the end of which time she again looked for her husband, but after looking in all directions she was unable to see him. After looking for some time without seeing him, she began to have fears that he must be dead for having gone outside of the straight limits directed him, and therefore he must have fallen into space. She began to weep and wail for her husband, for she loved him much. When her brothers heard the weeping they came to find out the cause. When they came in her presence, they asked her: “Why are you weeping?” “Your brother-in-law is dead.” We will here say a few words relating to the relatives of Namakaokahai and how they all mourned for Aukelenuiaiku."
"A hiki na kaikunane i mua o Namakaokahai, kena aku la ia: “E kii i na mea a pau o luna, e iho mai e kanikau no Aukelenuiaiku, oia ka po, ke ao, ka la, ka hoku, ka hekili, ke anuenue, ka uwila, ka waipuilani, ka ohu, ka ua noe, ka mahina oia o Kaukihikamalama, he kupunakane no Namakaokahai.

These were, the night, the day, the sun, the stars, the thunder, the rainbow, the lightning, the water-spout, the fog, the fine rain, the moon, Kaukihikamalama, the grandfather of Namakaokahai. “Bring them all down,” she said. “If they refuse to come to weep for my husband, I will kill them all.” After ordering her brothers to do this they proceeded on their way, and in course of a very short time everybody came, for they feared death by Namakaokahai."
"A hiki mai keia poe, kena hou aku la o Namakaokahai: “E kii i ko ka lani poe, oia keia, Kuwahailo, Makalii, Kamalanaikuaheahea, Kukuena, Mahuia, Ikuwa, Welehu.

A e olelo aku oukou i kuu kaikunane ia Makalii, pau ka hele ana mai o ka wahine maluna o ka lima o na kanaka, ina ia e hoole i keia, make ia ia’u i keia la.”","After the arrival of all these people, Namakaokahai again sent out her brothers to go and bring those who were in heaven. They were, Kuwahailo, Makalii, Kamalanaikuaheahea, Kukuena, Mahuia, Ikuwa and Welehu. “Tell all these people to come down and weep for my husband. If they refuse to come in obedience to my commands, I will kill them all. I also want you to tell my cousin Makalii, that his wife must cease coming on the hands of the people; if he disregards this, I will kill him this day.”"
"Mahope o keia mau olelo, ua makaukau na mea a pau loa, a ua akoakoa i loko o ka wa pokole. O ka hana a keia poe a pau loa, o ke kanikau i ke kane a ke ’lii wahine, oia no o Aukelenuiaiku. Ma keia kamailio ana, e hoi hou kakou e olelo no ka lele ana o Aukelenuiaiku.","In a very short time this message was delivered and the people all came together and joined in weeping for Aukelenuiaiku, the husband of their queen. We will now take up again the flight of Aukelenuiaiku."
"Ma keia lele ana o Aukelenuiaiku, aole oia i lele pono maluna o ke au o ke kaha pololei, nolaila, ua haule loa kona lele ana ma ka nenelu o ka lewa, a kokoke loa e make. A ma keia lele ana hoi, ua lolohi loa ko Aukelenuiaiku lima i ka paa i ka pahu o kona akua, o Lonoikoualii, nolaila, hoololi ae la ia ma kekahi aoao, ma keia hoololi ana, ike iho la o Lonoikoualii ke ’kua, ua haalele laua i ke au o ke kaha, kahi a Namakaokahai i olelo mai ai.

O ke kumu i puahilohilo ai o ka mahina, o ka puliki ana o Aukelenuiaiku, pela ka mea i olelo ia maloko o keia moolelo.","In this flight, Aukelenuiaiku did not fly within the straight limits given him, so he fell into space and he grew weaker and weaker until he was almost dead. In this long flight, the arm under which the box containing the god was held, became so tired that he changed the box under the other arm; in doing this the god Lonoikoualii saw for the first time that they had departed from the direct line shown them by Namakaokahai. Lonoikoualii then said to Aukelenuiaiku: “We are flying outside of the limits given us and not on the line. The fire is burning there on the earth and I see everybody has gone down below except one person.” Aukelenuiaiku asked: “Who is it that is still up here?” Lonoikoualii, his god, replied: “That thing stationed up there; fly for it and hold it fast, and then we will be saved.” The object which the god Lonoikoualii referred to was the grandfather of Namakaokahai, Kaukihikamalama, the moon. The reason why he was later than the [ ] others in obeying the summons of his granddaughter was because he was delayed in preparation of food for him on the way to the earth. But before he was ready to come he was held by Aukelenuiaiku, and because of this fact we now see the moon not quite as bright as it used to be. It was because Aukelenuiaiku held it so tightly. Anyway, that is the reason given in this story."
"A kau o Aukelenuiaiku a me Lonoikoualii i luna o ka mahina, ninau ae la ka mahina me ka hookae ia Aukelenuiaiku: “Nawai ke kupu o oe e na kanaka hookano? Aole i pii ia ko’u kua e ka’u moopuna ponoi, e Namakaokahai, a ia oe, pii ia ana ko’u kua.” “Nau no ke kupu, owau nei la.” “Na’u na wai?” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Nau no.” Olelo ae o Kaukihikamalama: “Oi ana kahi o ka pili ana?” “Owau ke keiki a Kapapaiakea laua o Iku.” I mai o Kaukihikamalama: “O ka hanai no oe a Kapoino laua o Kamooinanea?” “Ae, owau no.” I aku ka mahina: “Mai make e kuu haku.” Ma keia kamailio ana a Aukelenuiaiku me Kaukihikamalama i ka lani, ua lohe o Namakaokahai i lalo nei i ko laua olelo ana. Ia wa, akahi no a maopopo ia ia o Aukelenuiaiku keia, no ka mea, o ka inoa o Aukelenuiaiku ia lakou, o Kanakaokai. Nolaila, olelo ae la o Namakaokahai i kona makuakane, a me kona mau kaikunane: “Kupanaha! kai no he kanaka e keia, aole ka; eia no ka o Aukelenuiaiku, ke keiki a Kapapaiakea laua o Iku, ka hanai a Kapoino laua o Kamooinanea.”","When Aukelenuiaiku and Lonoikoualii landed on the moon, the moon in disgust asked of Aukelenuiaiku: “Whose conceited child are you? My back has never been climbed by my own grandchild, Namakaokahai, and here you have done it.” “I am your own child.” “Mine by whom?” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “Yours. I am the child of Kapapaiakea with Iku.” Kaukihikamalama then said: “Are you the ward of Kapoino and Kamooinanea?” “Yes, I am he.” The moon replied: “You came near being killed, my lord.” This conversation, in the heaven between Aukelenuiaiku and Kaukihikamalama, was overheard by Namakaokahai, who then knew for the first time that her husband was no other person than Aukelenuiaiku, because the name by which she knew him was Kanakaokai. Therefore she said to her father and brothers: “How strange this is! I thought that this person was somebody else altogether, but I now see it is Aukelenuiaiku, the son of Kapapaiakea with Iku, and the ward of Kapoino and Kamooinanea.”"
"Mahope o laila, kahea ae la o Namakaokahai ia Kaukihikamalama e lele mai, me ka moopuna, oia o Aukelenuiaiku. A hoi mai la o Aukelenuiaiku i ka honua, kena ae la o Namakaokahai i na mea hoomalamalama a pau loa e lele i luna o ka lani, i malamalama o Aukelenuiaiku ke hoi mai, oia ka la, ke ao, ka uwila, ke ahi.","After this, Namakaokahai called out to Kaukihikamalama to come to her with his grandson Aukelenuiaiku. When Aukelenuiaiku was returning to the earth, Namakaokahai commanded that all the different lights return to their respective stations in the heaven so as to give Aukelenuiaiku light by which to return to earth; these being the sun, the daylight, the lightning and the fire. When Aukelenuiaiku again reached the earth the people all cried for joy. After the weeping, Kuwahailo, Makalii, Kamalanaikuaheahea, Kaukihikamalama and the others prepared to return to heaven."
"A hiki o Aukelenuiaiku i lalo nei, uwe iho la lakou, a pau ka uwe ana, makaukau o Kuwahailo, Makalii, Malanaikuaheahea, Kaukihikamalama, e hoi. A pau lakou i ka hoi i luna o ka lani, noho iho la o Aukelenuiaiku me Namakaokahai he manawa loihi loa, ma ke ano o ke kane a me ka wahine; a mahope o laila olelo aku o Namakaokahai i ke kane: “E imi hou ae oe i ka wai ola loa a Kane.” Ae aku o Aukelenuiaiku i keia olelo a kana wahine, alaila, olelo aku o Namakaokahai: “Ke hoomoe nei au i keia auhau, mai ka puka o ka hale o kaua a ka hikina a ka la, nolaila, e nana pono oe me ka malama loa. Maanei oe e hele ai, mai keia kihi a kela kihi, maluna pono o ke au o ka aina a me ke kaha pololei loa, mai lele oe ma keia aoao, a ma kela aoao, o make oe. ”","After the return of their friends, Aukelenuiaiku and Namakaokahai for a long time remained by themselves, as husband and wife. After this, however, Namakaokahai said to her husband: “You must make another search for the water of everlasting life of Kane.” Aukelenuiaiku agreed to this. Namakaokahai then said to him: “I want you to watch the course you are to go by. From the door of our house in a straight line to the rising sun, and I want you to remember this: that you must go over this course from one end to the other, and you must not go outside of these limits, for if you do you will die.” At the close of the instructions, Aukelenuiaiku again began his second flight toward heaven. At the end of the long flight he stood on the edge of a hole, in the bottom of which was kept the water of everlasting life of Kane. The journey was only completed, however, after a flight of six months."
"A pau ke kamailio ana a Namakaokahai ia Aukelenuiaiku, lele aku la ia i ka lani, a ku ma ke kae o ka lua, aia i lalo o ia lua ka wai ola loa a Kane. O ka loihi nae, o ka manawa o ka lele ana, eono mahina.

When Aukelenuiaiku [ ] saw him he flew and lit on the back of the guard. While Aukelenuiaiku was perched on his back, he asked in anger and hatred: “Say, you are awfully conceited! Whose conceited child are you? My back has never been climbed by my grandchild Kamohoalii, and here you have come and done it.” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “Your own.” “Mine by whom?” “I am the child of Kapapaiakea and Iku.” “Are you the grandchild of Kapoino and Kamooinanea?” “Yes,” said Aukelenuiaiku."
"A lohe kela i keia mau olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, aloha mai la ia: “E walina hoi ia oe e kuu haku. Heaha kau huakai o ka hiki ana mai?” Olelo aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “I kii mai nei au i ka wai ola loa a Kane, no kuu keiki a me o’u kaikuaana.” Ninau mai o Kanenaiau: “Ua pau loa nae paha?” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Aole i pau.” I mai la kela: “Nana ia i kuu piko.” Ia Aukelenuiaiku e nana ana i ka piko, kuhikuhi mai la kela i ke ala e lele ai. “Auhea oe, mai lele ma keia aoao o pa oe i ka ohe, no ka mea, ina e pa ka ohe, o ka halulu no ia o ka ohe, a lohe ko kaikuaana, paa ka wai, aole e loaa mai ia oe. Nolaila, maanei oe e lele ai, alaila, loaa ia oe ka wai ola loa a Kane.”","When the guard heard these words from Aukelenuiaiku, he greeted him, saying: “My greetings to you, my lord. What has brought you here?” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “I have come for the water of everlasting life of Kane, for my nephew and my brothers.” Kanenaiau then asked: “Isn’t it all gone?” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “No, it is not all gone.” Kanenaiau said: “Look at my middle.” While Aukelenuiaiku was looking at the middle of Kanenaiau, he was instructed as to the course by which he was to fly, as follows: “Where art thou, don’t fly on this side, for you will strike the bamboo growing in this place; if you strike the bamboo, the sound will reach the ears of your cousin, and the water will be covered up and you will not get it. You must therefore fly on this side and you will be able to get the water of everlasting life of Kane.”"
"A pau ka olelo ana ia Aukelenuiaiku, mahope o laila, lele aku la o Aukelenuiaiku a kau ana i luna o Hawewe. E like me na olelo i kela mau mea i hala aku, pela no ka olelo ana maanei. I mai o Hawewe: “E kuu haku, heaha kau huakai o ka hiki ana mai?” “I hele mai au e imi i ka wai ola a Kane.” Ia wa, olelo mai o Hawewe: “Mai lele oe ma ka aoao hema, o pa auanei ka lama ia oe, halulu, o ia halulu a lohe ko kaikuaana i lalo, loaa ole ka wai ola a Kane ia oe.

O ka nui a me ka loihi o ka manawa o Aukelenuiaiku i lele ai, mai ke kanaka mua a keia kanaka hope elua mahina o ka lele ana.","At the end of these instructions Aukelenuiaiku continued on his flight. After flying for some time he saw and lit on Hawewe, when the same questions were asked relating to Aukelenuiaiku’s connections to him. Hawewe asked: “My lord, what is your object in coming here?” “I have come in search of the water of life of Kane.” Hawewe then answered: “You must not fly on the left side, else you will strike the lama trees, and the sound will reach the ears of your cousin below, and you will never be able to get the water of life of Kane. You must therefore fly on this side, then you will get what you wish.” These two men were the granduncles of Aukelenuiaiku on the side of his mother, Kapapaiakea. The time consumed by Aukelenuiaiku in his flight from the first man to the second man was two months."
"A haalele o Aukelenaiaiku i ke kamailio ana me Hawewe, lele hou mai la o Aukelenuiaiku a kau i luna o Kanenaenae.

At the end of the questions and answers relating to the parents of Aukelenuiaiku, Kanenaenae then knew that he was connected to Aukelenuiaiku, and he therefore fell on him and wept. At the end of the weeping he asked Aukelenuiaiku: “What has brought my lord here?” Aukelenuiaiku answered: “I have come for the water of everlasting life of Kane, for my nephew and brothers.” Kanenaenae then asked: “Is it not all gone?” “No, it is not all gone.” “Yes, you shall have it. Look straight at my middle.” While Aukelenuiaiku was looking, Kanenaenae said: “You must not fly on this side, for you will strike the loulu palm leaves and the sound will travel to your cousin there below, and the water of life of Kane will be closed and you will not be able to get it. You must therefore fly along this way. In this flight downward you will meet your grandfather who will direct you how to get to this water of life.” [ ]"

After the several questions had been asked and the usual answers given, Aukelenuiaiku said: “I am your own offspring.” The guard then asked: “Mine by whom?” “I am the child of Kapapaiakea and Iku.” When Kuemanu heard this he wept over Aukelenuiaiku and then asked: “Are you the grandson of Kapoino and Kamooinanea?” Aukelenuiaiku assented, saying: “Yes, I am their grandchild.” Kuemanu then asked: “What thing of such importance is it that has brought you here?” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “I have come in search of the water of everlasting life of Kane, for my nephew and brothers.” “Yes, you shall get it. You must go down to your grandaunt, who is down there at the base of the cliff, Luahinekaikapu, who is blind. When you come to her, you will find her roasting bananas, four in number. When she reaches out to take one up, you also reach and take one; do this until the last ones are taken. Then when she reaches out for the others and fails to find them and asks, ‘What mischievous fellow is this that has come?’ and receives no reply, she will take up the ashes and sprinkle them to her right; you must then run over to her left side. And when she sprinkles the ashes on her left side, you must run to her right side. After this you want to watch her as she takes up the ashes and smells of it. If she should do this, then she will discover you; then be very careful or the old woman will kill you. Look out for another attack, for she will then take up one of her clubs which is used for beating kapas and strike at you with it, when you must run to her left side; and when she strikes to her left, run to her right. After you have overcome all these things, then you must run and climb on to her back and sit there.”"

I have no eyes; I am blind; I cannot see. I may not be able to give you the water of everlasting life of Kane.” By these words of his grandaunt, Aukelenuiaiku began to be doubtful about getting what he wished, and for a moment he did not know what to do. At last he said to his grandaunt: “Let us go outside.” When she heard this she assented and she was led out by Aukelenuiaiku and was made to lie down under a coconut tree. Aukelenuiaiku then climbed up the coconut tree and picked off two young shoots of the [ ] coconut, and then called to his grandaunt: “Say, Luahinekaikapu, turn your face toward the sky.” When the old woman heard this she turned her face up as directed. Aukelenuiaiku then threw with much force the two young shoots at the eyes of Luahinekaikapu. When these struck her in the eyes, she jumped up and cried with a loud voice: “Oh! I am killed.” Aukelenuiaiku then called out to her: “Don’t cry, be quiet; rub your eyes, they may open up and you will then be able to see.” When the old woman heard this call from her grandchild, she began rubbing her eyes. After doing this her sight was restored and she was able to see as before. Aukelenuiaiku then called out to her: “How are your eyes?” “I can see now.” After this Aukelenuiaiku climbed down the tree."
"Olelo aku o Luahinekaikapu ia ia: “E kii oe i ka pohuehue a me ka akoko,” a loaa mai la ia mau mea i mua o ke alo o kona kupunawahine, kui iho la ia me ka nanahu, ke kukui, ka lepo, a wali; a pau loa keia mau mea i ka akoakoa.

She then took and pounded them together with some charcoal, kukui nut and dirt, until the whole mess became soft. The old woman then said to her grandchild: “We will now proceed to fix you up.” By this the old woman meant that she was to paint or rub the stuff prepared by her on the hands of Aukelenuiaiku so as to make them look like the hands of Kamohoalii."
"Mahope o keia mau mea, pena iho la o Luahinekaikapu i ka lima o Aukelenuiaiku a eleele loa, i like me ko Kamohoalii lima ka eleele; no ka mea, o ka poe nana i kiai ka wai ola a Kane, ua maa lakou i ka eleele o ka lima, no ka mea, o ka wai ua paa i ka pulama ia me na kiai, a o ka lima i paele ole ia a lalau, aole e loaa mai ka wai.","After these things the hands of Aukelenuiaiku were painted black so that they looked like the hands of Kamohoalii, for the guards who had the keeping of the water of life of Kane knew that the hands of Kamohoalii were black. The water of life of Kane was being watched by certain men, and any hands that reached down that were not black would not be able to receive the water."

[ ]","After the hands of Aukelenuiaiku had been blackened the grandaunt said to him: “We will sit here until the preparation of the awa is finished, when you must approach the opening. When you get to the opening, reach in with your hands. The first gourd they will give you contains the bitter water; throw that away and reach in again, and when they hand you the second gourd, that one contains the water of life of Kane; bring that with you.” Aukelenuiaiku then followed these instructions and approached the opening of the place in which the water of life of Kane was kept. After waiting for a moment Aukelenuiaiku reached in with his hands. When the guards saw these hands reaching in they were surprised, for they had never seen such a thing before. Being surprised, they hesitated for a while to study what they should do. The guards then took up some food and placed it into the hands of Aukelenuiaiku, but the hands dropped the food; they then placed some fish in the hands, and still the fish was dropped. The guards then wondered what the hand was reaching for. Finally one of the guards said: “Perhaps the hands are after the water of life of Kane.” One of the other guards thought that this was possible, so the gourd called Huawaiakaula, which held the water of life of Kane, was taken up and placed into the hands of Aukelenuiaiku."
"A loaa ka huewai ia Aukelenuiaiku lawe ae la ia a luna, hahaki ae la ia i ka nuku o ka huewai, ninini iho la i ka wai i loko o kona huewai, a mokumoku ae la i ka aha, o ka huewai oia o Paleaikaahalanalana.

Nolaila, haku iho la ia i mele aloha no kona kaikaina. Penei ua mele la:","When the gourd was given to Aukelenuiaiku, he came up with it; then he broke off the neck and poured the water into his own gourd; then he proceeded and [ ] broke the network of strings that held the gourd. This network was called Paleaikaahalanalana. After doing all this, Aukelenuiaiku began on his flight out of the hole, flying in a direction away from his grandaunt, Luahinekaikapu. But the grandaunt saw all this, and so she wept for her sister, Kamooinanea and her brother Lonoikoualii. She then recited the following mele, one of love for her sister:"
"“Kuhi aku au i Napili, I ke ala a Kanemakua i hele mai ai, Ka haku, ka lauoho o Kuliliikaua, He kanaka no o Lono e! He hopu manawa no Ulaula i ke ahi, He kaua ia Kuluheiua, Make ai ua loku, Hee ai na paka, O ka ua kilikili ka, O ka ua hoomau Hoomau ka ua i Kamakalana, Pili i ka hulu o Maui, Poowai o Ikumailani.

Lono is human indeed, For he has at times caught Ulaula, the fire, And has fought against Kuluheiua, Killed the heavy rain And routed the rain drops, The fine rain, The continuous rain That fell constantly at Kamakalana, Adjoining the forest belt of Maui, Headwaters of Ikumailani. There is a season, a season of endearment, A season, a season when they become parted. Cut the navel and its cord is severed. Art thou the one? Awake, O Lono! The earth above here is thine, O Kane, Where the waters are drawn up from the ocean, And are again sprinkled by Lonowaimakua. O ye rains! O ye rains!! How I grieve for you two as you drift by, How I long for the wind that blows the fine rain of Kuaihelani.”"

[ ]","While she was weeping and chanting the mele, Aukelenuiaiku was still flying. On this return flight he got tangled in the lama trees and the sound of the broken lama was carried below to the ears of Kamohoalii. When Kamohoalii heard the sound he woke up from his sleep and listened, trying to ascertain the cause of the sound, but after listening for two months no further sound reached him there below. Aukelenuiaiku on the other hand continued on with his flight until he again got tangled up with the loulu palm leaves, and again the sound was carried down below to Kamohoalii. After getting out of the loulu grove he continued on with his flight until he got into the bamboo grove, and the sound of the breaking of the bamboo was carried down to Kamohoalii. By this time Aukelenuiaiku had reached the top of the hole. [ ]"
"Maanei, e hoomaha uuku iho kakou i ka olelo a me ka hoolohe no Aukelenuiaiku, a e hoolohe kakou no Kamohoalii. Ia Aukelenuiaiku i hiki ai i kahi o ka lama e ku ana, ua hiki aku ke o ana o ka lama i na pepeiao o Kamohoalii, aka, ua kakali oia no ka hiki aku a hala elua mahina.

When Aukelenuiaiku entered the lama grove and he became entangled with the trees, the sound of the breaking lama was carried to the ears of Kamohoalii, but not being certain as to the direction from which the sound came, he listened for two months. At the end of the two months he heard the sound of the breaking of the loulu palm leaves, so Kamohoalii knew that the person who had entered these groves was traveling from the bottom of the hole upwards. This he was quite sure, because the sound of the loulu palm leaves was like the sound of thunder; the lama was like the sound of a shell, and the sound of the bamboo was like the beating of the waves against a cliff. By these different sounds and the rotation in which they sounded, Kamohoalii was able to know that the person was on his way out of the hole. Therefore he enquired of those who were guarding the water-gourd, Huawaiakaula: “Where is the water-gourd and the net outside of the gourd?” The guard replied: “You came and took it some time ago.” Kamohoalii then said to them: “I did not come for it.”"
"Mahope o keia olelo ana, lele aku la o Kamohoalii a loaa o Kuemanu, ke kiai o ka lewa, ninau aku la ia: “Aole anei oe i ike i ke kanaka kalohe?” I mai la o Kuemanu: “Ua ike au malalo mai nei, o ko kaikaina o Aukelenuiaiku, i kii mai nei i wai ola no ke keiki a me na kaikuaana.” A lohe o Kamohoalii, olelo aku la ia: “He kanaka hana ino ia. Aole ia o ka hana pono ana a ke kaikaina; o ka hele mai a launa, he alo he alo, kamailio pono ana, eia ka kana ke kii aihue. Aole au ahewa no kona lawe ana i ka wai ola, eia wale no, no ka hana ino ana ona i ke kupunawahine o maua ia Huewaiakaula, a me ke kupunakane o maua o Paleaikaahalanalana.” Eia ke ano, o ka hahahi i ka nuku o ka huewai, o ka mokumoku ana i ka aha o waho e paa ai.","After this Kamohoalii flew up until he met Kuemanu, one of the guards on the way up, and asked him: “Have you seen the mischievous man?” Kuemanu replied: “I saw him coming up from below; he is your cousin Aukelenuiaiku, who came for the water of life of Kane for his nephew and older brothers.” When Kamohoalii heard this, he said: “He is a wicked fellow. That is not the proper thing for a cousin to do; he should have come and seen me on the matter, and not steal it. I don’t blame him for taking the water of life, but he has ill-used our grandmother, Huawaiakaula, and our grandfather Paleaikalanalana.” This was because Aukelenuiaiku had broken off the neck of the water gourd, and also pulled to pieces the network of strings that served as the covering."
"A pau kana kamailio ana me Kuemanu, ia wa o Kamohoalii i hao ai i kona mana ma ka lele, aole o kana mai o ka lele, me ko Kamohoalii manao e loaa o Aukelenuiaiku, alaila, hana ma ka aoao keiki kane.

When Kamohoalii reached the top of the hole, he asked of the guard, Kanenaiau: “Have you seen the man that came up from below?” “I have seen him, and it was Aukelenuiaiku, your cousin.” “How long ago since he passed here?” “One year and six months.” When Kamohoalii heard this he seized Kekuaokalani’s stick, Hoolehelehekii, and returned to the bottom of the hole."
"A hiki o Aukelenuiaiku i ka moana i make ai ke keiki, me na kaikuaana, nini iho la ia i ka wai ola i loko o ke kai a kokoke e pau ka wai, he hapalua paha ke koe. Ia Aukelenuiaiku e nini ana, ike aku la o Namakaokahai i ke kane e nini ana i luna o ke kai, aole nae he ola o ke keiki a me na kaikuaana. Kahea aku la ka wahine: “E Aukelenuiaiku e, hoi mai.” A hiki mai la o Aukelenuiaiku, olelo aku ka wahine: [ ] “Halaoa oe e ke kane.” Ke ano o ia, mahaoi oe e ke kane. Wahi a ka wahine: “Kai no o ka imi kau a loaa na’u e hana aku, alaila, ola ko keiki me ou kaikuaana. Aole ka! O ka hoi mai no kau a hana naaupo; e pau loa aku la ka wai, aole e ola ko keiki a me ou kaikuaana.”","When Aukelenuiaiku arrived at that part of the ocean where his nephew and older brothers were destroyed, he poured out the water of life into the sea until it was almost all gone, leaving only about half of the water. While Aukelenuiaiku was pouring out the water of life, Namakaokahai saw her husband doing this, and she knew that the restoration of the nephew and brothers was not succeeding. She therefore called out: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, come home.” When Aukelenuiaiku arrived in the [ ] presence of his wife, she said: “You are very foolish, my husband. It was for you to go in search of the water, and when you had found it I would use it, and in so doing bring back to life your nephew and older brothers. But instead of this, you have come back and acted ignorantly. Had you poured out all the water, your nephew and older brothers could never have been restored to life.”"
"Eia ka mea hou, ia Aukelenuiaiku i hiki ai ma ka hale, a launa me ka mea aloha he wahine, mahope olaila, hanau ka laua keiki, oia o Kauilanuimakaehaikalani. Elua ano o ke keiki, he ano akua, a he ano kanaka. Ma ke ano o ua keiki la, he pohaku mai luna o ke poo a lalo o na wawae, a ma ke alo hoi, he kanaka mai luna a lalo o ke kino.","Soon after this they entered the house, and Namakaokahai was confined and a child was born to them, and he was named Kauilanuimakaehaikalani. This child had two natures, the nature of a god and of a human being. The appearance of the child at the back was like a rock, that is, from the head to the feet; but in front it had the appearance of a human being."
"I aku o Namakaokahai i ke kane: “Ho mai na’u e hoola ko keiki, a me ou mau kaikuaana.” Ae mai la o Aukelenuiaiku. Holo aku la lakou a ka moana i make nui ai, lana iho la lakou i laila.

Alaila, huli aku la lakou a nana i hope, aia hoi e ku mai ana ka moku ia manawa, a e pii ana na kanaka i luna o na kia, e lawelawe ana i ke kaula me na pea.","After the confinement Namakaokahai said to her husband: “Let me bring back your nephew and older brothers to life again.” Aukelenuiaiku gave his consent to this, and they set out to that part of the ocean where the brothers and nephew of Aukelenuiaiku had been destroyed and there they stopped. Namakaokahai then said to her husband: “Pour out some of the water of life in the hollow of your hand, and I will sprinkle it into the sea.” Aukelenuiaiku did as he was requested. Namakaokahai then dipped the end of her finger into the water and sprinkled it into the sea. After this they returned to the shore without looking back. On reaching land they turned and looked back and, lo and behold! there stood the ship; and they saw the men climbing up the masts folding the sails and coiling the ropes."
"Mahope nae o ka pae ana o Aukelenuiaiku ma i uka, olelo aku o Aukelenuiaiku i ka laua keiki ponoi me Namakaokahai, oia o Kauilanuimakaehaikalani: “E! i pae mai ou makuakane me ko kaikuaana, a i hakaka olua ea, mai olelo ino oe, no ka mea, he keiki leo kapu, he keike punahele, pane ka leo, make ke kanaka, kau i ka lele, no ka mea, o’u kaikuaana la, he manene wale ke lohe i na olelo pono ole, nolaila, e noho malie loa oe, mai pane iki, o ka noho oluolu ko olua pono, pela hoi makou, ko olua mau makua.” Ma keia mau olelo a ka makuakane, he ae wale no ka ke keiki.","After Aukelenuiaiku and the others had landed, Aukelenuiaiku said to his son, Kauilanuimakaehaikalani: “When your uncles and cousin come ashore and you should have a quarrel with your cousin, don’t use bad words, because he is a boy whose very words are sacred; he is a great favorite, and his very words are to be obeyed, even to death and the offering on the altar. My older brothers themselves are very touchy upon hearing words not altogether proper; so I want you to be very quiet; don’t answer back, but be at peace with one another. This will also be the course of your parents.” Upon hearing these words from his father, the boy promised to do as he was told."
"Ia Aukelenuiaiku e olelo ana no ke keiki, pae mai la na kaikuaana a me ke keiki i uka o ka aina. Uwe iho la lakou a pau me ke aloha, hoi aku la a ka hale noho iho la. Mai ka make ana, a ke ola hou ana, ekolu makahiki ka loihi. Mahope o ko lakou hui ana, haawi aku o Aukelenuiaiku i ka aina a pau i na kaikuaana.","While Aukelenuiaiku was cautioning his son, the older brothers and nephew came ashore where they all met and wept over each other, and after their greeting they went to the house and settled down. The length of time from their death until the bringing back to life of these people was three years."
"Eia ka lua, o ka wahine o Namakaokahai, haawi aku la ia i kona mau kaikuaana, o lakou ka mea mana maluna o ka wahine, me lakou ka moe ana, ka hele ana, ka noho ana. Penei ke ano o ka wahine i na kaikuaana; hookahi po, hookahi ao, e moe ai me kekahi kaikuaana, pela a pau like lakou, aka, o ko lakou mua loa, oia o Kekamakahinuiaiku ke kaikuaana huhu o Aukelenuiaiku, elua ona po, elua ao e moe ai me ka wahine a lakou, alaila pau. [ ]","After they had lived together for some time, Aukelenuiaiku gave all his lands to his brothers, and furthermore he also gave them his wife, Namakaokahai, and they virtually had all the say about her, and they slept with her, traveled with her and lived with her. The brothers took turns with the wife in this way: first one brother would have her for a day and a night, then the next brother would have her for a day and a night, and so on down; but the older brother, Kekamakahainuiaiku, the one who hated Aukelenuiaiku, had a double portion; that is, he took their wife for two days and two nights at a time. [ ]"
"Mai ka hoomaka ana o keia moolelo e malama ia a hiki i keia la, owai la ka mea like me ka mea hala ole me Aukelenuiaiku ka haawi wale aku i kona punawai momona no hai? Aole he mea like.","From the time in which this legend deals until today, who can be compared with Aukelenuiaiku for his great liberal nature in giving away his own possessions and even his wife to others? There is none like him."
"Maloko o keia mau olelo haawi a Aukelenuiaiku i ka aina a me ka wahine, aohe ona kuleana pono i koe, ua lilo ia i kuewa hoopili wale. Ia ia e noho haahaa ana, hookahi ana hana, he kamakoi ma na lae kahakai i na manawa a pau loa, a ua lilo loa ia i mea makaukau ia hana. Ia ia e hana mau ana i ke kamakoi, ua halawai mai o Pele laua o Hiiaka me ia, he mau kaikaina laua no Namakaokahai. Ia lakou e halawai ana ma kahi o Aukelenuiaiku e kamakoi ana, ua hoalualu loa ia ko Aukelenuiaiku manao e ko laua mau helehelena kino, oia o Pele a me Hiiaka. A he mea poina ole i ko Aukelenuiaiku manao ko Pele helehelena a me ko Hiiaka; ua lilo ia mea he mea hana ino i ka manao, a he mea hiaa loa i ka noho ana ma ka hale.","In thus giving away his wife and lands, Aukelenuiaiku reserved nothing for himself, and he therefore became like a dependent. While living in this humble way his one occupation was to go down to the seashore daily with a rod and spend his time fishing, and in time he became an expert. In his daily trips out rod fishing he often met Pele and Hiiaka, cousins of Namakaokahai. In their meetings Aukelenuiaiku began to admire the two girls, and he spent more of his time with them than he did at fishing. In time Aukelenuiaiku could do but very little fishing, for the desire to see the two girls, Pele and Hiiaka, was his greatest pleasure, and after a time he became infatuated with them and thought of very little else but the features of Pele and Hiiaka, and he found himself oftener with them than anywhere else."
"Ma ka olelo mua a kakou i olelo ae nei, ua lilo loa o Namakaokahai i na kaikuaana, a ua nele o Aukelenuiaiku i ka wahine ole, aka, o ko Namakaokahai manao, aole i pau kona aloha ia Aukelenuiaiku, e mau ana no e like me mamua.

Nolaila, hoolalau ka Aukelenuiaiku hana i ke aho, ka makau, ke kamakoi, e hamo ai me ka lohi au, a me ka apa.

A no ka maloo ole o ke aho, ua lilo ia i mea na kana wahine e noonoo ai. No keia mea ua lilo ia i mea kaumaha no Aukelenuiaiku.","We have seen that Namakaokahai had altogether become the property of his brothers, and that Aukelenuiaiku was without a wife; but Namakaokahai never forgot Aukelenuiaiku; she loved him still and held him as dear to her as before. At nights while at home, Aukelenuiaiku thought of nothing else but his two companions, and so each morning he would take up his line, hook and rod, and pretend to be very busy with them as though they needed overhauling. In doing this Aukelenuiaiku wanted to make his wife, Namakaokahai, believe that he was really very much taken up with his pastime, that of fishing, and in that way keep his wife from suspecting him. Aukelenuiaiku was absent once for three whole days on one of his fishing trips, and the wife began to suspect that something was wrong. Before this it was his usual custom to go out early in the morning, and after dark would come home; but this time he forgot to dry out his fish-line as before. When his wife saw this she became suspicious, and knowing that his wife knew his neglect about drying out his fish-line, he was very much depressed."
"A hala keia la, hiki hou mai kekahi la, he mea mau no ko Aukelenuiaiku iho ana i ka makoikoi i kai, a hiki i ke ahiahi, hoi aku la me ka wahine. Mamua ae nae o kona hoi ana me ka wahine, hou iho la i ke aho a me ka makau i loko o ka wai, i mea e manao mai ai ka wahine i ka lawaia.

I aku ka wahine: “Kupanaha oe, po ka la ke hele, o na wahi ia iho la no ia.”","The day after this Aukelenuiaiku as usual took up his rod and proceeded to the seashore; and toward evening he returned home. Before he started home, however, he soaked his fish-line and hook into the water so as to make his wife believe that he had really been fishing. When Aukelenuiaiku arrived at the house, he began to arrange his hook and line, and as he was at it for some time, his wife said: “It would be all right to be constantly occupied with your hook and line if you caught any fish; then those at home would get some. Here you do nothing else but work on your hook and line, and yet you never bring any fish home. What a waste of time!” The husband replied: “Do you think, my wife, that the fish is something you can catch with your hands in the sea so that I could bring them home all the time? Don’t you know that the line and hook are all I have in the matter, and not the bringing of the fish? That is entirely with the fish whether to bite at my hook or not.” Shortly after this conversation Aukelenuiaiku again started out fishing, and late that evening he returned with two small fish called aloiloi. The wife then said to him: “How strange of you to go all day and return at night, and these are all the fish you bring home!” [ ]"
"A hele hou o Aukelenuiaiku i ka lawaia, loaa hou ia ia ka apiki ma keia hele ana. Ua pau loa kona kino i ke nahu ia, a o kona ai, ua uwau ia a weluwelu, a ahiahi, hoi mai la me na wahi ia elua.

His body was bitten all over, while his neck was all scratched up, and in places it was cut. On this evening he again came home with two more small fish. On reaching the house Namakaokahai looked at her husband’s body and neck and saw that he was all scratched. She then spoke in parables saying: “Yes, there are two kinds of fish in the sea that bite: the shark and the eel.” Then she continued: “Strange, that your skin is all bitten and your neck scratched, but you don’t return with any sharks and eels.” Aukelenuiaiku then said with great cunning: “I met with a queer experience today. When I arrived at the seashore I tied the bait to my hook and cast it into the sea. After I had let the line down it got caught in the coral down below, and so I dived down and after getting the line loose I came up. I was not at all hurt at this time. But on casting my line the second time it again got tangled and I dived the second time. After this it was caught the third time and again I went down, but before I had gone very far I got the cramps and I was carried by the current away down to the bottom where I was rubbed against the coral until my back was all cut up. After this I recovered myself and swam up, and this time I was caught in an eel hole, and there I was rolled about by the surf until I was almost out of breath. Had I been a boy from the backwoods I would have been killed, and you would not have known how, and how pitiful that would have been.”"
"Ma keia kamailio ana, ua maopopo loa i na Anekelope maka palupalu a pau loa, e nana ana i keia moolelo, he kalohe io no o Aukelenuiaiku. A ua pili mai no ia hana mua i ka poe o neia mau la e hooipoipo ana, a nolaila he hana no ia a ke keiki Aukelenuiaiku e loaa ana i kona mau hooilina o keia mau la hope nei. A maanei no hoi e ike ai kakou i ko ka wahine puni ole.","To those who may be reading this story, it is plain to all the fair sex that Aukelenuiaiku was a deceiver, and that his scratches and bites came from another source altogether. The trait, however, will be found in his descendants in these latter days. And here we see that his wife was not to be deceived by him."
"Ma keia mau olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, aohe nalowale i kana wahine, ia Namakaokahai. I aku ka wahine: “E maalea, kuhi ana anei oe he naaupo au, i kau mau hana, a me kau mau olelo hoopunipuni? Ua maopopo ia’u, he wahine kau o kai e iho mau nei oe i na la a pau loa. Nolaila, eia ko’u manao ia oe: “E noa ko kino ia hai, mawaho, a o ka ili a me ka io, na’u ia na ka mea waiwai, aole o’u makemake e uwau, a e hana ino ia oe.”","With all Aukelenuiaiku’s smooth words, his wife did not believe him. She then said to him: “Say, cunning, do you think I am a fool, and am not aware of your doings and your deceit? I know that you have a woman whom you go down every day to see. So here is what I wish to say to you: The outside of your body is free to others, but your skin and flesh are my property, and I do not want to have you scratched and ill-treated.”"
"Ma keia mau olelo a ka wahine, heaha la ia ia Aukelenuiaiku, he mea ole. Hoomau aku la no ia i ka iho i ke kamakoi, a ma keia iho hou ana a Aukelenuiaiku, a hoi mai aohe kino i koe i ka uwau a me ke nahu ia, a pela me ka ai i ka uwau ia.

When Aukelenuiaiku came back from his next trip his body was scratched and bitten all over and his neck was cut in several places. When Namakaokahai saw how her husband was all cut up, [ ] and how he had disregarded her words of advice, she grew less angry of him and transferred all her anger to her cousins, Pele and Hiiaka."

When Namakaokahai’s anger was aroused she seized her cousins and gave them a severe beating. When the brothers saw this they jumped in to help the girls, but this interference was of no avail, for Namakaokahai gave her brothers some of the beating, and she gave them so much that they all had a hard time to save themselves. Because of this the cousins rose and departed to some other place to dwell; but Namakaokahai followed them and again drove them away. The cousins in the meantime thought that she would forget the cause of her anger, but she followed after them and drove them away from their new home. At this persistency on their cousin’s part, they vowed that they would never again turn back, nor ever again live in the same land with their cousin. At this expulsion, the two sisters studied where they would move to, and after considering several places they decided on Kauai and there make their future home. In this journey, when they reached Kauai, where they made their home, they had an idea that their cousin would leave them in peace and not follow them up. The place where Pele and Hiiaka took up as their first home on Kauai was at Puukapele, a place to the east of Mana. When they settled at this place they started a fire whose glare was seen from the high peaks in the land of Nuumealani, where Namakaokahai was stationed on the lookout for her cousins. The height of these peaks was probably as high as that of Kaala mountain."
"Ia Pele ma e ho-a ana i ke ahi a ike o Namakaokahai, ia wa no o Namakaokahai i hiki ai i Kauai a hakaka me na kaikaina; ma keia hakaka ana kokoke e lanakila o Pele ma laua o Hiiaka, aka, no ka nui loa o ko Namakaokahai ikaika, ua pio laua ia la. Nolaila, kipaku ia mai laua mai Kauai mai, a hele a noho i Oahu. No keia hakaka ana ua kapa ia kela aina o Puukapele a hiki i keia la.","When Namakaokahai saw the glare of the fire on Kauai, she knew that Pele and Hiiaka were there, so she followed on to Kauai where she met her cousins and another fight was had. In this fight Pele and Hiiaka almost overcame their cousin, but being possessed of great strength Namakaokahai was enabled to overcome her cousins. Therefore, being driven from their Kauai home, they journeyed on to Oahu where they settled. Because of the fight that took place on Kauai, the land in which it occurred was called Puukapele, and it is so to this day."
"Mahope o keia haalele ana ia Kauai, hele mai la o Pele laua o Hiiaka a noho i Kealiapaakai ma Moanalua, Oahu, malaila laua i eli iho ai a kaka i ka lepo, a noho iho la ma laila.

[ ]","Upon their arrival on Oahu, Pele and Hiiaka took up their abode in Kealiapaakai, at Moanalua, where they dug down into the ground and made a home. On coming from Kauai they brought some red dirt and some salt with them and deposited these things in their new home. Because of this fact these places were given the names of Kealiapaakai and Kealiamanu. Upon finding that the place was too shallow they went to settle at Leahi. While living at Leahi they tried digging down into the place, but again found it too shallow. The two then moved on to Molokai and settled down at Kalaupapa. After a time they began digging and were again disappointed in striking water; so they left Molokai. The hole they dug was called Kauhako. From Molokai they journeyed to Haleakala in Maui. Upon their arrival at this place they began digging a pit which they left open on the top of the mountain. The rocks in Hanakaieie, at Kahikinui, are those that were dug up by Pele and Hiiaka. [ ]"

After Pele and Hiiaka had been driven away from Kauai, through the terrible fight that took place, Namakaokahai returned to Nuumealani, and proceeded to the highest peak where she could see Maui. While Namakaokahai was living on Nuumealani, she again saw Pele and Hiiaka starting a fire on the mountain on Maui, so she left Nuumealani and came to Maui where another battle was fought in which Pele was killed. Namakaokahai then returned to the peaks on Nuumealani. After a time she looked towards Hawaii and saw Pele’s fire burning on Mauna Loa. But Namakaokahai discontinued her warfare against Pele and Hiiaka."

Pele was indeed really killed in the battle that was fought on Maui with her cousin, but she traveled in spirit to Hawaii, at which place she again came back to life. It was Pele and Hiiaka that dug that pit at Kilauea, on the slope of the Mauna Loa mountain, and this place has become their own to this day, and no one will dare dispute their claim. After the death of Pele, Namakaokahai returned to her own land in Kalakeenuiakane where she lived with her husbands and son and nephew."

The cause of the quarrel was this: The forehead of Kauilanuimakaehaikalani was cuffed by his cousin, the son of of the oldest brother of Aukelenuiaiku, the one whose every word was sacred. A few words in explanation regarding the two boys. One of these boys was human and the other, Kauilanuimakaehaikalani, was god-like. In their fight Kauilanuimakaehaikalani said to his cousin:"
"“Ka poe make iki, He poe ai oukou na ka ilo, He poe iwi kuakea, Na ko’u mau makua oukou i hoola, He poe oukou a moe ana i lalo o ke kai; Ua popo na maka.”","“You are a lot that for a time were dead, You were food for the maggots; You are a lot whose bones were whitened. It was my parents that brought you back to life, You were a lot that were asleep in the bottom of the sea With eyes all rotted.”"

When their youngest brother and wife saw that the brothers were about to depart, they entreated them not to leave them, but the brothers would not listen. After they were ready for their journey they boarded their ship and set sail for Kuaihelani; but in mid-ocean they encountered disaster and all sunk to the bottom of the sea."
"A liuliu ko laua noho ana, he kane a he wahine, a mahope o keia noho oluolu ana, nonoi aku o Aukelenuiaiku i kana wahine o Namakaokahai, penei: “E kuu wahine, ua nui na la i hala ia kaua o ka noho pu ana, a ua kokoke e make ma keia aina malihini; nolaila, ke nonoi aku nei au ia oe, e ae mai oe ia’u e holo au e ike i na makua o kaua.” [ ]","Here ends their story for they are all dead. Continuing that of Namakaokahai and Aukelenuiaiku. After they had lived on in peace and happiness for some time, Aukelenuiaiku said to his wife: “My wife, we have lived together now for many days, and I have become old and about to die in this strange land. I would therefore request of you that you grant me leave to go and see our parents.” [ ]"
"Mahope o ko Namakaokahai ae ana ia Aukelenuiaiku e holo i Kuaihelani, hele aku la o Aukelenuiaiku e hai aku i na kaikoeke i kona hele, oia o Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua, Kahaumana.

He said: “I am going to the land of Kuaihelani to see my parents.” When the brothers of Namakaokahai heard this they all gave their consent, and Kanemoe, the oldest, expressed a desire to accompany Aukelenuiaiku to Kuaihelani."
"E pono nae e olelo kakou no Kanemoe mamua, i ole oukou e haohao e ka poe e heluhelu ana. Ua olelo ia maloko o keia moolelo, ua hana o Kanemoe ma kona maalea.

Nolaila, ua hana ia ko Kanemoe uhane maanei i kino maoli, nolaila, e hoolohe kakou i ka moolelo.","We will here speak of Kanemoe, to prevent confusion. It is said in this legend that in order to accomplish his desire he had to resort to cunning and deceived his sister. Namakaokahai was feared by her brothers; therefore, in order to be able to answer the calls, Kanemoe planned to take out his spirit from his body and give it another body, and then to leave the one containing his spirit behind as a substitute to make the replies to the sister’s calls. No sooner than he hit upon this plan he proceeded to the making of the new body for his spirit."
"Unuhi ae la o Kanemoe i kona uhane, a noho iho la me he kino kanaka ala, Kahea aku la o Kanemoe e like me ka Namakaokahai kahea ana penei: “Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua, Kahaumana.” O like mai la lakou a pau loa, o na kino maoli ekolu, o ke kino uhane hookahi, ua like no na leo o lakou aole nae i ikaika loa, nolaila, noho hou laua mamuli o ka Kanemoe olelo, e olelo ana, “a ikaika ka leo o ka uhane, alaila, holo kaua Kuaihelani.”","After the body was completed Kanemoe took out his spirit and put it into the new body, which resembled him in all details. In order not to make any mistakes in reference to the sound of the voice he thought he would make a test, so he called out, imitating his sister: “Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua, Kahaumana?” They all answered, the three real bodies and the spirit. The voice sounded just like his, except that it was rather weak. Because of this weakness in the voice of his substitute, he prevailed upon Aukelenuiaiku to delay their trip for a while until the voice of his substitute grew stronger. This request was granted and the trip was postponed for a while."
"A pau keia mau mea ia laua, holo aku la laua a noho i Kuaihelani. Elua po, elua ao, hiki laua i Kuaihelani.

The trip took up two nights and two days. Upon their arrival at Kuaihelani, they looked over the land but failed to see any of the people; they heard no sound of any kind; there was nothing good growing on the land, for the land was overgrown with weeds."
"A hiki laua i ka lua, kahea iho la o Aukelenuiaiku: “E Kamooinanea e!” Aole he leo i olelo mai, nolaila, manao laua ua make.

When they came to the mouth of the hole, Aukelenuiaiku called: “Kamooinanea,” but no response was heard, so they thought that she must be dead. The reason why Kamooinanea did not hear the call was because the coral on her forehead and the coral of the floor of the sea had grown together and she was entirely covered over, so she was unable to hear the call of her grandson Aukelenuiaiku. After calling, Aukelenuiaiku stood up and stamped his feet down on the coral with all his might, breaking it into pieces, and at the same time exposing the body of his grandmother. When Aukelenuiaiku looked at her body, he saw that it was thin and reduced to almost nothing. [ ] Aukelenuiaiku then called her, saying: “Kamooinanea.”"
"“O”, ae la o Kamooinanea, “O”. Nana ae la ia, o kana moopuna o Aukelenuiaiku, aloha ae la ia: “E walina oe.”","Kamooinanea answered, “Yes.” Then she looked up and she saw that it was her grandson, Aukelenuiaiku. She then greeted him, saying: “My greetings to you.”"

“I hoi mai e ike ia oukou.” Ninau hou aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Auhea o Iku ma?”,“I came to see you all.” Aukelenuiaiku asked of Kamooinanea: “Where is Iku and the others?”
"I mai o Kamooinanea: “Aia i Kauai kahi i noho ai. O ke kumu o ka hele, o ka naauauwa ia oukou i na keiki, no ka pau loa i ka hele.

The reason they left was because of the anguish for you boys, for you had all left them. When your father, Iku, arrived at Kauai he got into a fight with Kukoae, the king of Kauai, but he was victorious and became the king of Kauai. After a time another battle was fought because of your sister, who is very pretty, and your father was defeated by Makukoae. ”"

That upon the arrival of Olopana and his wife Luukia in Tahiti from Hawaii, Moikeha became infatuated with Luukia and soon after took her as his paramour. Olopana, the husband of Luukia, harbored no ill feeling at this action of Moikeha, but looked on without showing his disapproval, and was, in fact, of one mind with his friend."
"Mahope iho oia manawa, lilo ae la o Olopana i kuhina nui nona ma na aina apau o Tahiti.

At about this time Mua, a Tahitian Prince, also became infatuated with Luukia, but his approaches were not approved, or, rather, were not encouraged by Luukia, although he, upon several occasions, pressed his suit with great vigor. When he saw that although his suit was being rejected, that of Moikeha’s was being accepted, he thereupon made up his mind to sow discord between her and her lover, and in that way persuade Luukia to be separated from Moikeha."
"I kekahi manawa, he alii puni lealea o Moikeha, hele aku la oia maloko o na aha lealea pahee, olohu, a me kekahi mau lealea e ae.

It was often the case at these places where the games were held for people to gather and to cheer the winners. In the course of these games the cheering and commotion were often heard by Luukia."
"A i mea e ko ai ko Mua manao ino no Moikeha, nolaila hele aku la o Mua, a i mua o Luukia, olelo aku, me ka ninau aku nae: “E Luukia, ua lohe ae nei anei oe i keia leo uwa o ka aha lealea a ke alii?” (Moikeha).

E olelo hoohilahila ana o Moikeha ia oe no ko wahi huna; aole paha kela piha uwa a ke alii he pono.”","One day Mua, in order to carry out his designs to sow discord between Moikeha and Luukia, happened to be in the presence of Luukia when the cheering at the games was heard, and, believing that the opportune moment was come, asked Luukia: “Say, Luukia, do you hear the cheering at the king’s games?” Luukia answered: “Yes, I hear the cheering.” Mua then remarked to Luukia: “You must not for one moment think that that cheering at all means well for you. No, Moikeha is publicly defaming you. That cheering is not intended for your good.”"
"A no keia mea, lilo iho la keia olelo hoopunipuni a Mua i mea oiaio ia Luukia.

Luukia thereupon ordered her immediate attendants to lash herself in such a way as to bar herself against his approaches. Luukia was then corded with a fine rope from her waist to the middle of her thighs, and the ends of the rope were then fixed in such a way as to make them almost impossible to be found. This cording, spoken of as the “pau of Luukia”, is used as a covering for water-gourds, [ ] and it is also used in the lashing of the single as well as of the double canoe, and is spoken of as such even at this present generation."
"Ia Moikeha i ka lealea a hoi mai, me ka manao ua pono ka noho ana, aole ka.

Upon Moikeha’s arrival at home he met Luukia, and although there was some small change in his reception, still on the whole he was treated in the usual manner, Luukia entering into conversation with him. It was only after Moikeha had discovered that Luukia had been lashed that she ceased speaking to him. Immediately upon arriving at the palace, Moikeha saw that there was something wrong by Luukia’s countenance, and he at once began to ponder within himself as to the probable cause of the trouble."
"A ma ka po ana iho, i loko o ko laua manawa moe, he mea haohao ia Moikeha i ka moe pu ana me kona pau, aole hoi i ikeia ia mea mamua i loko o ko laua mau la oluolu. E like me kona (Moikeha) ike ana i ka hana a kela wahine ana, pela no oia i kali ai me ka nana ana i loko o na po eha, aia nae, e mau ana no ka paa mau o ka pau o Luukia; a no ia mea, ma kekahi po iho, makemake ae la o Moikeha e ike ia laua iho ma ko laua kuleana mau. I ka manawa i kupu ae ai ko Moikeha manao e ike me kana wahine, alaila, wehe ae la o Moikeha i ka pau o Luukia, a hemo, i nana aku ka hana o ke kane, ua hoahaia o Luukia i ka aha a paa loa, mai ka puhaka a na kumu uha. Nolaila, ninau aku la o Moikeha ia Luukia, i ke kumu o keia hana a ka wahine, aka, aole nae e hiki ia Luukia ke hai aku.

A heaha la hoi kana, eia hoi wau ke hele nei a huna na maka i kahi e, i ku hoi kuu makaia.”","That night, while in their preparation to retire, Moikeha was surprised at seeing Luukia retiring with her pau still on, something entirely unusual with her, she not having done anything of the kind during their peaceful days. Moikeha, however, did not show his surprise by any utterance, but bided his own time for four nights with the determination if possible to find out the cause of this extraordinary behavior on the part of Luukia. On the fourth night Moikeha saw no change, Luukia still wore the pau on retiring. The next night, Moikeha, with a desire to ascertain the cause of this queer behavior, undertook to unfasten the pau, and after it was unfastened he saw that Luukia had been corded from her waist to the middle of her thighs. Upon making this discovery, Moikeha asked Luukia why she had done this, but she made no reply. From evening until midnight Moikeha urged her to tell him the cause of this lashing, but she utterly refused to even say one word. All through the rest of the night Moikeha pondered over this recent change that came over Luukia and said to himself: “Your actions are indeed strange. Here we have been living right along in peace, and now you will not even speak to me. What fault have I committed that you should cause yourself to be lashed in this manner? Very well then, I am going to absent myself from you and shall go to some other land, and thus give you a chance to have your wish fulfilled.”"
"Ia manawa, hoolale koke ae la o Moikeha i kana keiki hookama, e hoomakaukau na waa, me ka olelo aku o Moikeha i ua keiki la: “E holo kaua i Hawaii, no ka mea, e naauaua ana wau i ke aloha o ka wahine Luukia, a nalo kaupaku o kuu hale Lanikeha nei la, alaila pau ka manao ana ia Tahiti.” Ia manawa, hoolale koke ae la o Kamahualele i na i-hoewaa, a makaukau, alaila, lawe ae la o Moikeha i na kaikuahine ona ia Makapuu laua o Makaaoa, a lawe ae la i na kaikaina ia Kumukahi laua o Haehae, a lawe pu ae la i kona kahuna ia Mookini, a me na kanaka koikoi o ko Moikeha alo, oia o na hookele a me na kahuna punahele, a me na kiu nana e nana ka aina.","Thereupon, Moikeha directed his foster-son to make ready the double canoe in the following words: “Let us sail for Hawaii, because I am so agonized for love of this woman (Luukia). When the ridge-pole of my house, Lanikeha, disappears below the horizon, then I shall cease to think of Tahiti.” Kamahualele then directed the paddlers to get the double canoe ready. As soon as this was done Moikeha took his sisters, Makapuu and Makaaoa, his two younger brothers, Kumukahi and Haehae. He also took his priest Mookini and the chief men who wait on him, such as his navigators and sailing masters, his immediate attendants and favorites, and also his spies who were to spy out the land."
"Ma ia wanaao, ma ka puka ana o ka hoku hookelewaa, kau ae la o Moikeha maluna o na waa ona, a kau pu aku la no hoi me kona mau hoa holo. Mai ia wanaao a puka ka la, ike mua lakou ia Hilo, ua pono ka holo ana, ia wa ku mai ai o Kamahualele [ ] a pule aku la ma ke ano mele e like me ka mea i oleloia ma mua ae. A hiki mai la lakou i Hilo, makemake ae la o Kumukahi laua me Haehae e noho i Hilo, a hoonoho ae la o Moikeha ia laua malaila.","One early morning at dawn, just at the rise of the star Sirius, Moikeha boarded his double canoe, taking with him all his attendants and followers, and set out from Tahiti. From that morn until sunrise when they first beheld Hilo all went well, [ ] whereupon Kamahualele stood up and prayed by way of a mele their voyage hither. Upon their arrival at Hilo, Kumukahi and Haehae became charmed with Hilo, and so expressed to Moikeha their desire to remain there, whereupon Moikeha allowed them to take up their residence at Hilo."
"Ia manawa haalele o Moikeha ma ia Hilo a holo mai la lakou ma ka aoao akau o Hawaii, a hiki ma Kohala, makemake ae la o Mookini me Kaluawilinau e noho ma Kohala, nolaila, hoonoho ae la o Moikeha ia laua malaila.

A ia lakou i hiki aku ai, aia nae o Kakakauhanui ka mea nona ka waa. O kana hana mau o ka lawaia, a he mea mau no ia ia ka holo ma ia wahi i na la a pau i ka lawaia.","Moikeha soon after set sail from Hilo, sailing along the north coast of Hawaii until they arrived at Kohala, when Mookini and Kaluawilinau expressed their desire to take up their residence at Kohala. Moikeha therefore landed them there. On leaving Kohala they sailed along the eastern coast of Maui until they reached Hana, when one of his men, Honuaula, expressed his desire of making this his place of residence, so he too was allowed to remain behind. From this last place they sailed on until they were between Lanai and Molokai. When directly opposite Kawela, Kamahualele spied a canoe directly out from the Kalaau Point, when their course was changed and the canoe was steered towards this canoe by Kamahualele. Upon their arrival at the place where the canoe was floating, they found it was Kakakauhanui. This man’s usual occupation was fishing, and it was his daily custom to come to this place for this purpose."
"Nana ae la o Moikeha, he kanaka nui a puipui o Kakakauhanui, a he kanaka ikaika a ano koa no hoi. Nolaila lawe ae la o Moikeha ia ia i aikane nana, me ke kauoha iho nae: “E noho oe i anei, e holo ae wau a loaa ia’u kahi kupono o makou e noho ai; aia a hiki mai kekahi hoouna i ou nei alaila hele ae oe.” A pau ka lakou olelo ana malaila, haalele lakou ia Kalaau, a holo aku la a hiki i Oahu, a no ka makemake o na kaikuahine e noho ma Oahu, nolaila nonoi aku la o Makapuu laua o Makaaoa ia Moikeha e noho i Oahu, me ka i aku: “Ua makemake ae nei maua e noho maanei, i ike aku ai i ke ao o ka aina, Tahiti.” A no ia mea, mamuli o ka makemake o kona mau kaikuahine, hoonoho iho la ia Makapuu laua o Makaaoa ma Oahu.

Upon arriving at Oahu, Moikeha’s sisters expressed their wish to remain in Oahu and make their homes here, so Makapuu and Makaaoa requested Moikeha to allow them to remain, saying: “We wish to make this our place of residence, where we can see the cloud drifts of Tahiti.” Because of this desire on the part of the two sisters, Makapuu and Makaaoa, they were allowed to remain on Oahu, thus leaving Moikeha, his foster-son Kamahualele, the two paddlers Kapahi and Moanaikaiaiwe, Kipunuiaiakamau and his companion, and the two spies Kaukaukamunolea and his companion, to continue on the journey."
"Haalele iho la lakou ia Oahu, holo aku la a hiki ma Wailua; ia manawa, ua ahiahi poeleele ko lakou hiki ana aku, nolaila, aole lakou i pae iuka, hekau iho la na waa i ke kai a po a ao; ma ke kakahiaka nui nana aku la na kanaka i keia kaulua e lana ana iloko o ke kai, me ka puloulou alii i luna.

This was late in the evening, being dark when they arrived, so they did not land, but moored their double canoe all that night until the next day. Early in the morning the people saw this double canoe floating in the sea with the kapu sticks of a chief aboard. About this time the canoes made for the landing and were lifted up and deposited on the shore. When the travelers landed, the people were gathering in great numbers to go surf-riding at the surf of Kamakaiwa. In this gathering of people were the two daughters of the king of Kauai, who were on their way to ride the surf; they were Hooipoikamalanai and Hinauu. Upon seeing the people on their way to ride the surf, Moikeha and his companions also followed along to take part in this morning exercise. Moikeha was a goodly man to look upon, he had dark reddish hair and a tall commanding figure."
"Hele aku la o Moikeha ma i kahi e heenalu ia ana; he alii maikai o Moikeha, he ehu kumuuli, he kanaka loihi no hoi. A o Hooipoikamalanai ma hoi, makemake [ ] ae la laua ia Moikeha, a manao ae la laua e lawe ia Moikeha i kane na laua.

Moikeha in the meantime was also struck with the beauty and grace of the two sisters, and he, too, fell in love with them and decided to take one of the girls to be his wife. After enjoying the surf for a time, Hooipoikamalanai and her sister returned home and informed their father of what they had seen, and said: “We wish to take that young chief as a husband for one of us.”"
"A mamuli o ka makemake o na kaikamahine alii o Kauai hooholo ae la ko laua makuakane, e kiiia o Moikeha a e laweia mai ma ka hale o na kaikamahine alii; alaila kiiia aku la o Moikeha, a me kona mau hoa, a laweia mai la.

Moikeha and his company were thereupon sent for and were brought in the presence of the king. The love on the part of the young people being mutual, Hooipoikamalanai and Hinauu took Moikeha to be their husband. So Moikeha thus became king of Kauai after the death of his father-in-law."
"Mahope iho o ko Moikeha hoao ana ia Hooipoikamalanai laua o Hinauu, lilo ae la o Moikeha i alii nui mamuli o ka make ana o kona makuahunowai kane. Noho iho la o Moikeha me kana mau wahine, a loaa mai loko ae o lakou elima mau keiki, he mau keiki kane wale no. A penei no ka mookuauhau o ia hanauna:","After Moikeha had taken Hooipoikamalanai and Hinauu to be his wives, he became the king of Kauai, after the death of his father-in-law. Moikeha had five children with his two wives, all boys. Following is the genealogy of that generation:"
"O Moikeha ka makuakane, o Hooipoikamalanai ka makuahine, o Kapaa i Kauai ka aina, oia kahi o Kila i hanau ai. Ekolu lakou o ka hanau ana, o Kila ka muli. I ko lakou wa kamalii, he hooholoholo waa ka hana i ka muliwai o Wailua, a i ka wa nae e hakoko ai me na kaikuaana, na Kila no ka eha o na kaikuaana.

There were three children in the family, of which Kila was the youngest. While very young it was their custom to resort to the Wailua River and there learn the art of canoe sailing. In the wrestling matches Kila, though the youngest, always prevailed over his older brothers. One day, in order to determine which one of his sons was the strongest, bravest and most skillful in the art of canoe sailing, Moikeha decided to give them a test. After calling his sons to come before him, he said: “I want you all to go to the other side of the river and set your canoes down in the water and let them sail toward me. The one who will be able to so steer his canoe as to hit me in the navel will surely be the most prosperous amongst you.” After arriving at their stations the first-born set his canoe down and steered it to his father, but it missed the mark. The second son then in his turn set his down and steered it for the mark, but it missed also. Kila then in his turn started his, and it sailed directly to Moikeha and hit his navel. Moikeha then addressed his sons, saying: “You two,” turning to the oldest, “will never amount to much. This your youngest brother will be the most prosperous of you all.”"
"A nui ae la o Kila, nui pu kona maikai a me ka nani, a oia ko Kauai oi a puni; aole ona lua, nui pu me ka ikaika a me ke koa. O Moikeha, mai Kahiki ka hele ana mai, i aaia i ke aloha o Luukia, a haalele aku ia i kona hale ia Moaulanuiakea, a me na ’lii, na kanaka, na kupu o ka moana.","As Kila grew up into manhood he also grew in beauty and manliness, so much so that he was recognized as the most handsome man in all of Kauai, he having no equal. He also grew up to be a very strong and brave man."
"Ma kona hele ana mai, loaa o Kakakauhanui i ka lae o Kalauu i Molokai, e lawaia ana. He kanaka uha loihi ia, e luu ana ke kino ilalo, e kaohi ana ka uha i ka waa, he kanaka aho loa. Lawe mai la o Moikeha ia ia i keiki hookama, a noho i Kauai. He ’lii nui o Moikeha, a he ’lii no hoi ka wahine o Hooipoikamalanai, no Kauai a puni.","Moikeha originally came from Tahiti, through grief and depression of spirit over Luukia. Because of his great grief he left his home Moaulanuiakea, the chiefs, the people and the demi-gods of the deep. On his way to Kauai he met Kakakauhanui off the Kalaau point, Molokai, fishing. This man had very long legs; his body while in the water could steady his canoe with his legs. He could stay under water without breathing for a very long time. Upon meeting this man, Moikeha took him as an adopted son and brought him along to Kauai. Moikeha was a high chief, and his wife Hooipoikamalanai was a chiefess of very high rank throughout the whole island of Kauai."
"Hoomakaukau o Moikeha i na waa no kana keiki no Kila, e holo ai i Kahiki i kona wahi i kumakaia ia ai e kona poe enemi. A makaukau, ee na hoewaa, na ka liu, na kahu, na makuakane hanauna; o Kakakauhanui, o Kila i luna o ka pola o na waa.

After everything pertaining to the voyage was ready, the paddlers, the bailers, immediate attendants, uncles and Kakakauhanui boarded the canoe together with Kila, who sat in the covered platform, and they set sail for Tahiti. Before Kila boarded the canoe, however, Moikeha addressed him saying: “You are on your way. Don’t fail to recognize your uncle Makalii, or you will kill him.” After all the islands had disappeared and all that could be seen was the top of Maunakea, they were met by Keaumiki and Keauka, two [ ] monster demigods of the deep, who drew their canoe down to the coral beds of the sea: so Kakakauhanui dove down to the bottom and stayed there for ten and two nights before coming up again. Keaumiki and Keauka were only able to stay down ten nights. This feat of endurance saved the canoe. The voyage was then resumed. When they were approaching near to Tahiti they first touched at a small island where the aunt of Moikeha was living, a supernatural rat, Kanepohihi by name. Her eyes were covered over with wrinkles and she was blind. When Kila came upon her she was cooking bananas in the ashes. When he saw Kanepohihi cooking bananas, he reached down, took the bananas and placed them on to one side of the cooking place. When Kanepohihi reached for the bananas she was unable to find them, so she said to herself: “There must be a demi-god about.” At this Kila addressed her saying: “My greetings to you, Kanepohihi.”"
Olelo aku o Kila: “I aloha mai ko moopuna haku ia oe.”,Kila continued: “Your grandchild and lord send you aloha greetings.”
Ninau aku o Kanepohihi: “Owai ua moopuna haku nei a’u?”,Kanepohihi asked: “Who is this grandchild and lord of mine?”
"Ninau hou mai o Kanepohihi: “Ke ola ala no ka o Moikeha?” “Ae, ke ola ala no.”",Kanepohihi again asked: “Is Moikeha then still alive?” Kila replied: “He is still alive.”
"“I walea ia Kauai, I ka la hiki ae a po iho, I ke kee a ka nalu o Makaiwa, I ka hiki mai a ka la maluna, O ke kalukalu o Kewa, O ka wai halau o Wailua. O ka lealea o ka mai o kuu makuahine, O Hooipoikamalanai, O kahi noho no o Kauai a make.”","“He is indulging in ease in Kauai, Where the sun rises and sets again, Where the surf of Makaiwa curves and bends, Where the sun comes up over The kalukalu of Kewa; The cool and calm shade of Kewa, The stretched out waters of Wailua, And the entrancing favors of my mother Hooipoikamalanai. He will live and die in Kauai.”"
"Olelo mai o Kanepohihi: “Akahi ka hoi ka loaa o ko makou inoa ia oe, aole hoi he loaa o kou inoa.” Olelo aku o Kila me ka hai i kona inoa ponoi: “O Kila iuka, o Kila i kai, o Kila pa wahine, a Hooipoikamalanai o Kama au a Moikeha.”","Kanepohihi replied: “You seem to know my name, but I don’t know who you are.” He then told her his own name: “I am Kila of the uplands, Kila of the lowlands. I am Kila, the last child of my mother Hooipoikamalanai, and the offspring of Moikeha.”"
"Olelo mai o Kanepohihi: “E kuu haku, heaha ka huakai a kuu haku o ka hiki ana mai?” I mai o Kila: “He huakai imi alii.”",Kanepohihi replied: “You are my lord. What is the object of this voyage and visit paid me by my lord?” Kila replied: “It is a voyage in search of a chief.”
"“Aohe alii; a Kahuahuakai pau na ’lii i ka luku ia, koe ko makuakane, koe au a me ka muli o ko makuakane, nolaila, hele aku ai ko makuakane o Moikeha a noho ia Kauai.” Ma ko Kila mana a me ka ike, olelo aku la ia: “He ’lii no, aia la i uka o Wahiawa, ua alai ia mai e ka ohu, ua paa ia Huihui laua o Maeele.” O ke kumu o [ ] Kila i hiki ai imua O Kanepohihi, o ka pololi. I mai o Kanepohihi: “Aohe a’u ai, o ka noho wale iho la no i anei. Hookahi no mea ai o ko makuakane o Makalii.”","Kanepohihi answered: “There are no chiefs left. Kahuahuakai was the last of the chiefs that was slain, with the exception of your father, myself and your father’s younger brother. This was the cause why your father Moikeha left this place and moved to Kauai.” [ ] Through Kila’s power of foresight he answered: “There is a chief. He is living in the uplands of Wahiawa, screened by the fog and secreted by Huihui and Maeele.” The reason why this call was made by Kila on Kanepohihi, was because he was without food. To the request for food, Kanepohihi replied: “I have no food. All I do is to live in idleness here. There is only one person who has food, your uncle Makalii.”"
"A Makalii, o ko Moikeha kaikaina no ia, a oia no ke ’lii o ka aina, a nana ua koko nei o Makalii (no ka inoa), ilaila ka ai, ka ai, na mea a pau loa. A he ike no ko Makalii i ke kilokilo e like me Moikeha, a me Kila; no kona ike e hiki aku ana nei kupu (Kila) i ka aina, nolaila, lawe keia i na mea ai a pau a paa i ke koko, kau i luna, oia kela olelo kahiko o Hawaii nei: “Hului koko a Makalii kau iluna.” E pii ae ana o Kanepohihi ma kona kino iole, a aki i ke koko a Makalii, haule ka ai a me ka ia i lalo nei, loaa ka ai a Kila a me na ohua.","Makalii was Moikeha’s own younger brother, and he was the king and ruler of the land. He had a net named after himself, Makalii, in which were kept the food and fish as well as other things. Makalii, who was also educated in all of the arts of the day, could tell of coming future events, as well as Moikeha or Kila. Because of this power as a fortune-teller he was able to foresee the arrival of Kila to his kingdom. So he took up all the food and placed it in a net and hung it out of reach, which was the origin of the old Hawaiian saying: “Makalii drew in his net (koko) and hung it up.” Kanepohihi, on being requested for food, changed herself into the form of a rat and climbed up, nibbled at the net of Makalii, cutting it and causing the food and fish to fall out, thus supplying Kila and his companions with food."
"Holo aku la o Kila a hiki i ka aina, holo aku la ka waa o Kila a ke awa kapu e ku ana ka pahu kapu, no Moikeha ia wahi; aohe waa pae malaila, aohe kanaka hele, hele no make, he kapu mai ko Moikeha noho ana a hele, oia mau no ke kapu a me ke kiai ia.

This place was Moikeha’s; no canoe was allowed to land here; no person was allowed to pass by it upon pain of death. The place had been kapued before Moikeha left, and ever since his departure its sacredness had been maintained. When the canoe was nearing the landing place the people on shore were heard calling: “There is a canoe! There is a canoe!! That canoe does not seem to have any fear for the kapu of the king. Your superior strength, if any you have, will be the only salvation for you this day.” Before Kila and his people reached the landing place and hauled their canoe up on the sand, he was bundled up and placed on the platform. Kila, as we have said, was a very handsome man and was good to look upon, so much so that it could not be hidden by the covering in which he was wrapped. After he had been placed on the platform he addressed his followers, saying: “When you see a large man come to the canoe, it is Mua. He is a great admirer of women. He is the man that was the betrayer of Moikeha, and the one that caused Moikeha to leave his own country. Don’t tell him about me, in case he should ask you.” As soon as Mua reached the canoe, he looked over the men and stood them up. Examining the first one and finding a protuberance on his body, he remarked: “You will never be able to get Luukia.” He then examined the next man, and so on to the last, with the exception of Kila. The reason why Mua examined the men was because he wished to find one who could command the admiration of Luukia, and by him get a chance to approach Luukia, as he had never been able to please Luukia even up to this time."
"He wahine maikai loa o Luukia, aohe ona lua ma ia aina a puni, o ka Olopana wahine ia, aole nae o laua moe kino, no ka pehu o Olopana, nolaila, ua paa o Luukia i ke kamaaha ia e Olopana (oia kela aha waa, e hoa ia nei a hiki i keia la), mai ka hele ana mai o Moikeha a hiki ia Kila. [ ]","Luukia was a very beautiful woman and had no equal. She was the wife of Olopana, and owing to his being afflicted with the dropsy they never lived together. [ ] Luukia, however, had been bound, or netted, by Olopana with small cord in the fashion of the lashing of canoes ever since the departure of Moikeha."
"Nolaila, ninau aku la o Mua: “A heaha hoi keia opeope nui e kau nei i ka pola?” Olelo mai na kanaka: “He opeope kapa.” Hele aku la keia haha, a ike iho la he kanaka. Haha iho la o Mua, wehe ae la i ke kapa, nana iho la ma ke kua, a me ke alo, aohe puu, aohe kee, olelo iho la: “Loaa ia oe o Luukia. Ea, a i loaa o Luukia ia oe, na’u e moe mamua.”","Upon seeing the bundle on the platform, Mua asked the people: “What is this large bundle on the platform?” The people replied: “It is a bundle of clothes.” Mua then went up to it and felt the bundle. After feeling it he opened the bundle and discovered a man. He then looked all over the man and found him to be perfect in every respect. He then remarked: “You will be admired by Luukia. If in case you should, will you ask her to be mine?”"
"Mamua ae o ka nana ana o Mua ia Kila, ua olelo aku o Kila i na kanaka: “I hiki mai auanei o Mua a i nonoi mai e moe me Luukia, olelo aku oukou, e moe i loko o ka waa nei, ilalo ke alo, aohe make ala, aohe make oni, aohe make olelo, e moe malie, i loaa o Luukia.” A pau ka nana ana ia Kila, olelo aku la na kanaka ia Mua e like me na olelo a Kila, a lohe o Mua, he mea olioli ia. A moe o Mua i lalo ke alo, i loko o ka waa, olelo aku o Kila i na kanaka: “E mimi maluna iho o Mua.” Pela ka hana ana, a po ka la, a ao ka po, a po hou ka la, ua lana ka mimi maluna o Mua, a make iho la ia me ke ko ole o kona kuko ia Luukia. Pela i hookoia ai ka huhu o Moikeha i kona mea nana i kumakaia, ma ka noonoo o kana keiki o Kila.","Before Mua boarded the canoe, Kila had instructed his men as follows: “If Mua should come and ask that some one of you ask Luukia to be his wife, tell him to lie in the canoe face down, and not to get up or move about or speak, but he must lie very quietly so that he will be able to get Luukia.” After inspecting Kila, the people told Mua to do as they had been instructed by Kila. When Mua heard this he was very glad. As soon as Mua had lain face down in the canoe, Kila told the men to hold Mua down and urinate on him. This was done until it covered him for two days and one night, so that he died without accomplishing his desire respecting Luukia. Thus, through the wit of Kila, was the betrayer of Moikeha his father avenged."
"Iloko o ko Moikeha wa e noho alii nui ana ma ke aupuni, elua ona koa ikaika loa, o Niniukalani, o Pohinakahonua, aohe koa e oi mamua o laua. Hele mai la o Niniukalani me kana laau palau, o Kahikinaakala a ke one maloo, oniu. Olelo aku o Kila i na kanaka: “Owai ko oukou e hele e koa me Niniukalani?” Aohe kanaka aa, no ka makau; ku ae o Ukulii a olelo: “Owau ke hele e koa.” Ae mai o Kila: “Ae, o oe, o ko uuku auanei komo oe i loko, o koiala nui hele i waho, i lele oe i uka, mai nana oe iluna, o make oe, i lalo oe e nana ai i ke aka, i ka malu maluna ou. Ina e hookaa kela i ka laau ma ka hema, ma ka akau oe e ku ai, aia ka hauna laau ma ka hema, a ina hoi ma ka akau ma ka hema oe.”","During the reign of Moikeha he had two very powerful warriors, Niniukalani and Pohinakahonua. There were none stronger than these two. Upon seeing the canoe coming to be moored on the kapued grounds, Niniukalani took up his war club, Kahikinaakala, and approached the canoe. When he reached the dry sand he began twirling his war club. As the man was approaching, Kila asked his men: “Which one of you is willing to go and fight Niniukalani?” No one spoke up for some time, as they were all afraid. Ukulii, however, arose and said: “I will go and fight him.” Kila then said: “Yes, you are so small that you will be able to get very close to him. When you get ashore don’t look up or you will get killed; but keep your eyes always down and watch the shadow over you. If he twirls his club on the left, jump to the right, as he will then strike to the left; and if he twirls on the right, jump to the left. ” After Kila had imparted his instructions, Ukulii jumped ashore with his war club and approached Niniukalani. Niniukalani was twice the size of Ukulii and was sure of beating him, which he likened to so much chaff."
"A pau ka olelo ana a Kila, lele aku la o Ukulii me kana laau, lele aku la a ku me Niniukalani, ua palua kona nui imua o Ukulii, a he mea ole o Ukulii i kona manao ana, heaha la ia imua ona? He opala. Ia wa, ua piha ke one i na ’lii a me na kanaka he nui loa, e nana ana i ke kaua, aole nae o lakou manao e ola ana kahi kanaka uuku i ke kanaka nui. O Niniukalani, ke hookaa nei i ka laau palau ana, ia Kahikinaakala hoomoe iluna o Ukulii, komo ae ana o Ukulii i ka akau, hala ka laau, loaa ke one, puehu liilii, moe ke awawa, nalo laua nei i loko o ke one. Manao na mea a pau ua make o Ukulii; a mahope, ku hou laua nei, hookaa o Ukulii i ka laau ma ka hema a [ ] hoana, aole nae i uhau, alo e o Niniukalani, e waiho ae ana keia ma ka akau, loaa no o Niniukalani, make loa, kaawale o luna me lalo.","At this time the place was packed with the chiefs and people who were eager to see the conflict. They never had any idea that the small man had any chance with the big man at all. Niniukalani, upon seeing Ukulii, began to twirl his war club, Kahikinaakala, and, when Ukulii was within striking distance, let it come down; but Ukulii jumped to the right and toward his opponent. The club missed its object and hit the sand, causing it to fly in all directions, and left a deep valley, hiding the two contestants from view for a time. Everybody believed that Ukulii was killed. After [ ] the cloud of sand had settled, the people saw that both of the contestants were still there. Ukulii then twirled his club and made a feint as though to strike. Niniukalani dodged, but before he could recover himself, Ukulii struck to the right which caught Niniukalani squarely, cutting him in two and killing him instantly. At this the crowd cried out: “One for the stranger and none for the son of the soil. Nobly done! No wonder this canoe dared to land on kapued ground, for it carries a noble warrior.”"
"Uwa ka pihe o uka: “Akahi a ka malihini, aole a ke kamaaina. Koa! malama no i komo ia ai ke awa kapu o ke ’lii e keia waa eia ka he koa.” Ku mai o Pohinakahonua, me kana laau palau o Puaihanuole, paha, kaena: “He uhau ole ia i ka laau; e uhau ia okaoka, aole ia e pakele ia’u.”","Pohinakahonua, upon seeing the death of his mate, came up with his war club, Puaihanuole. He then issued a challenge, boasted and said: “He could not have been struck at; if he had he would have been in pieces. He shall not escape me.”"
"O Ukulii, hoi aku la no ia a na waa noho. Ninau o Kila: “Owai ke hele e hakaka me Pohinakahonua?” I mai o Hohoiea: “Owau.” Ao ao mai la o Kila a maopopo, hele aku la a ku me Pohinakahonua.

When Pohinakahonua was seen to come out and issue his challenge, Kila asked: “Which one of you will go and meet Pohinakahonua?” Hohoiea answered: “I will.” Kila then instructed him what to do, and he jumped ashore to meet Pohinakahonua. As soon as he was within reach Pohinakahonua swung his club to the right, but Hohoiea was not there, as he had jumped to the left of Pohinakahonua. Hohoiea then swung his club from the ground upward, which cut Pohinakahonua in two from his hips to his head, killing him. At this the crowd gave another shout, saying: “The strangers have two, and the sons of the soil have none. This canoe carries some mighty men who have killed the warrior guards of the land.” The result of the conflict was then carried to the king, Makalii. When Makalii heard it he arose and came down with his war club, Naulukohelewalewa. Makalii at this time was living in a land above the clouds. Makalii was a goodly man to look upon, closely resembling his older brother Moikeha. He was very powerful and brave, but not like Kila. As Makalii arrived on the kapued ground he began to swing his war club right and left. Upon seeing this Kila said to his men: “That is Makalii, the king. He is a very powerful man; none of you will be able to stand up against him. I will go and meet him. But before I go, I want you to remember this: if I shall be slain in this encounter, you have your course of escape, return by it to Kauai; but in case I live, then all will be well.” Kila then took up his war club, Kahihikolo, and jumped ashore from the canoe, stepping on the rocks. At sight of Kila the crowd began to shout, admiring his beauty. Even the ants were heard to sing in his praise; the birds sang, the pebbles rumbled, the shells cried out, the grass withered, the smoke hung low, the rainbow appeared, the thunder was heard, the dead came to life, the hairless dogs were seen and countless spirits of all kinds were seen. All these things mentioned were the people of Moikeha, who upon the arrival of Kila his son, caused themselves to be seen, in testimony of Kila’s high chief rank."
"A kokoke o Kila i o Makalii la, hoomoe iho ana o Makalii i kana laau palau, ia Naulukohelewalewa hio ka makani, lele ka lepo me ke one, kahawai kahi i loaa ai i ka [ ] laau, nalo laua i loko o ka lepo. Manao o uka, ua make o Kila; a pau ka wili ana o ka lepo, ku aku ana no o Makalii me Kila, no ka mea, ua kaa akau ka Makalii laau, ma ka hema ka hoomoe ana. Nolaila, komo o Kila i ka akau, a pakele i ka make weliweli a Makalii. Ku hou laua, hookaa na laau hoomoe o Kila i kana laau palau, ia Kahikikolo i lalo o ka lepo, mana kahawai, kahe ka wai, wili ka puahiohio, wili ka lepo me ke one i ka lewa. O Makalii, ua loaa i ka hau o ka laau a Kila, ua waiho i lalo, o ke kumu o keia pakele ana o Makalii, o ka olelo kauoha a Moikeha i ka wa i Kauai ia Kila penei: “Ke hele la, a i hakaka oe me ko makuakane me Makalii, mai hana naaupo oe, o make ko makuakane.” Oia wale no ko Makalii mea i ola ai, ina ua haalele i ka la i ka mea mahana.","As Kila came within reach, Makalii brought down his war club, Naulukohelewalewa. The wind whistled by, the dust and sand arose in clouds, and a deep valley [ ] was seen where the club struck the ground. The two were hidden in the dust. The people ashore thought that Kila was killed, but after the cloud of dust and sand had settled they beheld Makalii and Kila still facing each other; because when Makalii swung his club on the right he brought it down on his left, so Kila had jumped toward the right side of Makalii and was saved from a terrible death. As they again faced each other, Kila twirled and brought down his club, Kahikikolo, the swirl of which felled Makalii. The reason of this escape was because Kila had in mind the warning given him by Moikeha his father, upon his departure from Kauai, in the following words: “You are about to go on your voyage. If you should fight with your uncle, don’t be thoughtless, else you will kill him.” This was the only reason why Makalii was saved; otherwise he would not have again seen the warming sun."
"Hoi aku la no o Kila a luna o na waa noho, o Makalii hoi, waiho iho la, a moa ka umu, ala ae la me ke kunewanewa a hoi i ka hale. Ma keia hoi ana, he mihi nui ko Makalii i kona pakele mai make, o kona ike ana no ia i ka aina, hoi i luna a make.","After the fight Kila returned to his canoe, while Makalii laid on the ground for a period of time sufficiently long to cook an oven (umu) of food; whereupon he arose and staggered to the house. While on his way to the house he congratulated himself on his miraculous escape. This was the last time he was seen on earth, for he returned up above and died there."
"Puni ae la ka aina ia Kila, pae aku la na waa, hele aku la o Kila, uwe ka pipipi, a ninau mai: “Heaha ka huakai a kuu haku o ka hiki ana mai?” I aku o Kila: “He huakai imi alii.” Hoole mai ka pipipi: “Aohe alii, ua make, o makou wale no koe, haalele ia iho makou e ko makuakane, i keia wahi, aohe ai, aohe ia, ua lawe aku ko makuakane a pau loa, o ke opu wale iho no ka makou.” Pela no o Kila i hele ai, me ka uwe mai o na makaainana ia ia nei, a hiki keia i ka hale o Moikeha ia Moaulanuiakea. He hale maikai loa, a he hale kiekie loa no hoi, he hulu manu o luna i ako ia ai, he iwi manu ka aho, he kauwila ka laau. (Ua oleloia i loko o ko Moikeha kaao, oia kona kumu i noho ai ia Kauai me Hooipoikamalanai, alaila, nalowale ke kaupoku o kona hale o Moaulanuiakea.)","The end of this contest saw Kila master of all the lands. The canoe was then beached and he went ashore. At this the shells cried and asked: “What is the object of this voyage that has brought my lord here?” Kila replied: “It is a voyage in search of a chief.” The shells said: “There are no more chiefs; all are dead. We were deserted by your father in this place, without food and without fish, your father taking everything with him, and we have managed to just exist.” Kila then continued on his way, meeting the former inhabitants of the land who wailed and cried to him, until he arrived at the palace of Moikeha, Moaulanuiakea. This was a very beautiful house, being very lofty and was thatched over with the feathers of birds. The battens were made from the bones of birds and the timbers were of kauila wood. It is said in the legend of Moikeha that the reason why Moikeha journeyed to Kauai and lived with Hooipoikamalanai was on account of his oath, never to return after the ridge-pole of his house, Moaulanuiakea, had sunk out of sight."
"A hiki o Kila, nana aku la ia i ka hale, nani, hanohano, kiekie, aole nae he kanaka, ua paa na puka, ua make na kiai, ua kupu ka nahelehele. Aia ia Kila, he ki no ka hale, no na kiai, no na mea a pau.

Hoa ia ae la ka ipukui o Moikeha e Kila, hoi aku la o Kila a luna o ka hikiee o Moikeha moe, po iho la moe o Kila. [ ]","When Kila arrived at the house he looked it over and saw that it was indeed grand, majestic and lofty; but there were no people; the doors were fastened; the guards were dead and the place was overgrown with weeds. Kila, however, had with him the means of unfastening the doors and of bringing the guards to life as well as everything else. As he opened the gate, two of the guards came to life and wept over him. As he entered the roadway to the house, two more of the guards came to life. Arriving at the main door, two more guards came to life. As the door was opened another two came to life, and entering the house he found a guard in each room who all came and kneeled before him with tears in their eyes. Kila then lit the lamp which once belonged to Moikeha, walked to the couch and laid down. [ ]"
"Ia Kila e moe ana, hele mai la o Luukia a mawaho o ka hale hoomakakiu, e nana ana i keia mea wena i loko, a me ka ula, a ike o Luukia i keia mea ula, uwe iho la ia me ka helelei o ka waimaka.

A pau ae la, hoi aku la o Luukia, a mahope lilo loa ia Kila.","While Kila was asleep Luukia came outside of the house, spying, watching this glow inside, its redness; and when she saw this red glow, tears fell from her eyes. She choked, and her heart quickened when she thought it was Moikeha. The night was far spent when the guards fell asleep. Luukia walked softly and carefully to where Kila was sleeping and looked at him; he resembled Moikeha, but was handsomer. She leaped on him crying, and embraced and kissed him. Kila awoke startled and looked at her. Then they contended together until the break of day, when Luukia said: “I have no private; it was corded up by Olopana, and it has been sealed up from the time your father went away to this day.” Kila then said: “If you will consent it can be unfastened, and it can be closed again.” Luukia consented, and Kila unfastened [the cords]. Then they gathered up the fine strands of thought, indulging in love’s desire, and braided the lehua wreaths in dreamland, after which Luukia went her way. Later she became wholly Kila’s."
Ka Moolelo no Umi: Kekahi Alii Kaulana o ko Hawaii Nei Paeaina.,The Story of Umi: One of the Most Noted of Hawaiian Kings.
"Ua olelo ia ma keia moolelo, he keiki kapa alii o Umi, ma ka aoao o kona makuahine, o Akahiakuleana, a ma ka aoao o Liloa kona makuakane, he ’lii nui mai ke kumu mai, a ma ia aoao, he ’lii nui o Umi. [ Aka, ma ka hoomaloo ana i ka pololei o ka aoao o ka makuahine, loaa no he ’lii nui o Akahiakuleana, mai loko mai no o ka mookuauhau alii o Hawaii.]","It is said in this story that Umi was a part chief because his mother, Akahiakuleana, was not a high chiefess, although his father Liloa was a very high chief, whose genealogy could be traced to the very beginning of all things. So it is said that Umi was high on his father’s side, but very humble on his mother’s side. [ But in tracing out as to the origin of Akahiakuleana his mother, it is found that she must have been of very high blood, for her name appears in the genealogical tree of the kings of Hawaii.]"
"O Umi ka mea nona keia moolelo, aka, i mea e maopopo ai ka oiaio, nolaila, e hoomaka ka olelo mua no kona kaikuaana no Hakau.

He ’lii nui aimoku o Liloa no Hawaii a puni.","This story pertains to Umi, but in order to get at all the facts the story of Hakau his older brother should also be considered. Liloa was the father and Piena was the mother of Hakau; the father as well as the mother were chief and chiefess of very high blood. It is said that Hakau was one of the highest chiefs of Hawaii because both of his parents were of equally high blood. Waipio in Hawaii was the place where Liloa had his permanent residence. Here he lived with his wife Piena, and it was at this place that Hakau was born. Liloa was the king of the whole of Hawaii."
"A hanau o Hakau, ke keiki mua a Liloa me kana wahine hoao me Piena, hele aku la o Liloa mai Waipio aku a hiki i Koholalele, ma ka hikina o Hamakua, e pili ana me Hilo.

[ ]","Some time after the birth of Hakau, the first son of Liloa by his wife Piena, Liloa started out from Waipio and journeyed to Koholalele, a place at the east end of Hamakua, close on to Hilo. The cause of this journey by Liloa was to dedicate a temple which was at this place. The name of the temple was Manini. After the ceremonies pertaining to the dedication of the temple were ended he journeyed over to Kaawikiwiki, where he stayed for some days. The cause of the delay at this place was the games that were being held, for it was the place where people from all the neighboring districts gathered to partake in the game of pahee especially, although other games were also held there. While at the place, he one day went out to bathe in the Hoea stream, which is located next to Kealakaha. When he arrived at the place he saw a very beautiful woman, Akahiakuleana, coming out of the stream, without clothing. Her maid servant was sitting on the bank of the stream with her mistress’s garment. When Liloa saw Akahiakuleana his desire to possess her became so great that they laid together, resulting in the birth of Umi, the subject of this story, for Akahiakuleana was just over her days of defilement, hence her quick conception.
