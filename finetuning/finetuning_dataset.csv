"A loaa o Aukelenuiaiku, hoi mai la laua a hiki i ka hale kahi o ko laua makuakane e noho ana, lele mai la ko laua makuakane uwe, a me na mea a pau loa. O ka nui o na la o keia kaawale ana ewalu la. Mamua ae o ka loaa ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua paa ka moku o na kaikuaana i ke kapili, a ua makaukau e holo, ua lana i loko o ke kai. Ma keia ola hou ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua lohe ua kaikuaana huhu lokoino nei, ua hoi mai o Aukelenuiaiku, a nona keia makena e uwe ia mai nei. Nolaila, kena ae la ia e hoomakaukau ka holo, e kahu ke o, a e ee i luna o ka moku.","After Aukelenuiaiku was found he was brought home to their father who fell on his son and wept for joy, as did all the others, for he had been lost for about eight days. Before Aukelenuiaiku was found, the ship of the brothers was completed and preparations were made for departure, as it had been launched. When the oldest brother saw that Aukelenuiaiku was again back safe and well, and that the wailing that he had heard was because of the return of Aukelenuiaiku, he immediately gave orders that the final preparations be completed; that the food be cooked, and after that everybody was to go aboard."
"Mahope iho o ko Moikeha make ana, laweia aku la kona kupapau ma ka pali o Haena, a hiki i ka manawa a Kila i hoihoi ai i Tahiti. Ia manawa mahope iho, noho iho la o Kila ma ko Moikeha noho ana, e like me ka makemake o kona makuakane, a me kona mau makuahine, a me ka makuakane o na makuahine.","After the death of Moikeha, his dead body was taken to the cliffs of Haena where it was deposited until a convenient time for Kila to remove it to Tahiti. Soon after this Kila began to assume the reins of government and ruled in place of Moikeha, according to the wish of his late father, his mother and aunt, and his mother’s father."
"A lohe na makuahine o lakou i keia olelo, kanikau hele aku la o Hooipoikamalanai, e hoonaauaua ana ia laua iho me Hinauu. I aku la o Hooipoikamalanai ma i ka laua mau keiki: “Auhea la hoi na iwi o ko oukou makuakane?” I mai la kana mau keiki: “Ua lilo i ka moana, ia kahuli ana no o makou, lilo makou ia Kila kahi i aumeume ai, aole o makou manao ae i kela.” A mahope iho o keia manawa, kanikau hele aku la o Hinauu ma i ke aloha o Kila a puni o Kauai, a huipu aku la me na makaainana i ke kanikau.","When the mothers heard this account of the death of Kila, Hoopoikamalanai and her sister Hinauu wailed and expressed a desire to take their own lives, their grief for their son was so great. Hooipoikamalanai and her sister then inquired of their sons: “Where, then, are the bones of your father?” The sons replied: “We lost them in the ocean. When our canoe was overturned we all went to the rescue of Kila, and therefore the bones of our father were neglected and they disappeared.” After this Hinauu and her sister traveled around Kauai mourning for Kila, in which the common people also joined with them."
"A hala aku la na kaikuaana o Kila, noho iho la o Kila ia koena po, e noonoo ana i ka hana a kona mau kaikuaana. A kokoke i ka wanaao, a no ka loihi o kona ala ana ia po, nolaila, ua pauhiaia oia e ka hiamoe nui. A ia ia e hiamoe ana, ua hiki ae ka la, a mehana iki ae, ike ia mai la ua o Kila e hiamoe ana i kaha one. Hele mai na kamaaina a ike i keia keiki maikai e moe ana, ua pauhia i ka hiamoe. A nolaila, hoala ia ae la, me ka ninau iho o na kamaaina, i kona wahi i hele mai ai a me ke ano o kona hiki ana malaila. Alaila, hai aku la oia i ka moolelo e like me ka hana a kona mau kaikuaana. A no ia mea, hoihoi ia aku la e na kamaaina ma kauhale kamaaina.","After the brothers had gone, Kila remained the rest of the night in meditation, trying to comprehend the object of his brothers’ actions. Toward morning he fell into a deep sleep after sitting up most of the night. While he was asleep and the sun was rising higher and higher, he was seen by the people, who came to admire this handsome young man who was fast asleep on the sand. At last the people woke him up and asked him where he had come from and the circumstances of his arrival at this place. He then told them the whole history of his treatment by his brothers. He was then taken to the home of one of the men."
"Aka, lohe ae la na kaikuaana o Kila, aia ka ai ma Waipio, manao ae la ko lakou kupunakane, a me ko lakou makuahine e holo i ai i Waipio; aka, aole nae e hiki ia lakou ke ae e hele, no ka mea, ua hana hewa aku lakou ia Kila malaila, oia no ko lakou mea i kanalua ai, o hele auanei lakou, o ike mai o Kila ia lakou, nolaila pono ole. Aka no ka paipai nui o ko lakou makuahine i na keiki e holo, hoole loa aku na keiki. A no ka paakiki loa o na keiki ma ko lakou manao, nolaila, ninau pakahi aku la ko lakou mau makuahine i ka laua mau keiki, no ka makemake e holo i ai i Waipio. Aka ua hoole na mea a pau o na keiki ana; a ma kekahi manawa mahope mai, ninau pinepine aku no i na keiki; ekolu keiki i hoole, a hookahi mea i ae e hele i ka ai i Waipio, o Kaialea.","When Kila’s brothers heard that there was food at Waipio, their grandfather and mothers made up their minds to send the boys to Waipio for food; but none of the boys were willing to go, because it was at this place that they had abandoned Kila to his fate; so they were very reluctant about going, for fear that he might see them and there would be trouble. As often as their mothers urged them to go they as often refused, and finally they told their mothers that on no condition would they think of going. Upon meeting this persistent refusal on the part of their sons, the mothers determined to ask them one by one, to see if there was not a chance to persuade one of them to go, but every one of them refused. The mothers would not have no for an answer, and kept on urging the sons till finally one of the boys, Kaialea, consented to go to Waipio to get them some food."
"A o ko Kauai poe hoi, ua kali ia mai la o Kaialea, aole he hoi aku, nolaila, hoouna ia kekahi mau kanaka e Hooipoikamalanai ma e huli ia Kaialea. Ia huli ia ana a hiki i Hawaii ma Waipio. Ia manawa a lakou i hiki aku ai, ninau ia mai la lakou nei, ko Kauai poe, i ke kumu o ko lakou hiki ana i laila. Aka hai aku la lakou, “he huakai imi alii, e imi ana ia Kaialea.” A no kea mea, hai aku la na kamaaina: “Ua make o Kaialea, aia maloko o ka heiau, ua oleloia nae e kau ana i ka lele, aka, aole nae i ikeia ke kau ana i ka lele, ua make malu paha, ua kiola ia paha maloko o ka lua pau.”","In the meantime the people on Kauai awaited Kaialea’s return. But after a long wait without hearing anything of him, Hooipoikamalanai and her sister sent a party of men to come and institute a search for him. On this voyage, the party arrived at Waipio, Hawaii. Upon their arrival they were asked why they had come, so they replied that they were in search of a chief, Kaialea by name. On learning the mission of the strangers, the Waipio people informed them that he had been condemned to be put to death. They further told the strangers that Kaialea was now in confinement in the temple, and it had been reported that he was to be sacrificed, but so far no one had seen him sacrificed, but it was possible that he had been put to death secretly. On the other hand he might have been thrown in a deep pit."
"A o na kanaka hoi i hoi malu ai i ka po, na hoewaa i holo pu mai me Kaialea, a me kekahi kanaka i hoouna hopeia mai e Hooipoikamalanai, hoi aku la lakou a hiki i Kauai; ninau mai la o Hooipoikamalanai: “Auhea hoi ko oukou nui?” I aku la lakou: “I mai oukou-e, he pono keia hoi ana mai nei, aole paha he pono. O Kaialea, aia ke paa la i loko o Pakaalana, a o ka poe hou ae nei hoi, ke paa pu la lakou, aole i ikeia ko lakou ola; ina no i make la, make mai la no. Na ke akua ko lakou ola, ke ola mai o nei mau la.”","In the meantime those men who had returned secretly to Kauai, Kaialea’s paddlers and the man who had charge of the canoe, arrived there and were questioned by Hooipoikamalanai: “Where are the rest of you?” They replied: “Don’t think that our return means well; no, there is nothing to rejoice over. Kaialea is in confinement in the temple of Pakaalana, as well as some of the people that came later. They are all in confinement. We cannot speak of their fate. If they have been put to death, then they are dead by this time. If they are still living, then they live through the mercy of God.”"
"He koa kaulana o Piimaiwaa, ma Hawaii a puni, a ma Maui no hoi, no kona koa loa, a me kona makau ole, no kona aa e paio me na enemi e ku ana i mua ona; nolaila, ua punahele ia i kona makuakane alii hanai o Umi. Ma keia kakau ana e ike ai kakou i kona koa lua ole, a me kona makau ole i na enemi, alaila, e pono kakou e olelo he oiaio kona mau olelo hoike.","Piimaiwaa was the most famous of the soldiers of the whole of Hawaii and even of Maui, for his braveness and strength, and it was said that he never failed to go up to meet his enemy. Because of this he was the favorite of the adopted sons of Umi. We will here see that he was indeed the bravest of the brave and fearless of the enemy, so that we too without doubt will say that such is the fact."
"Nana hou ae la no ua o Lonoikamakahiki nei, e kau ana ka ihe kaua, ninau ae la: “Heaha kela?” I aku na kahu: “He mea luku kanaka no, he mea luku aku i na kanaka ke kaua mai, ina i kahi e, e hou aku ai, ku aku la no ke kanaka. A ina he akamai mai kekahi aoao i ka pale ana o ka ihe, alaila, aole e ku.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ae, he mea waiwai ia, aka, o ka mea akamai i ka alo ihe ke kanaka waiwai; nolaila, he hana waiwai ia a kuu makuakane, nolaila, ina eia no kuu piko ke waiho nei, alaila, e nikii pu i kuu piko me ka pua ihe a kuu makuakane.”","Again Lonoikamakahiki looked up and saw a bundle of war spears; he then asked: “What are those things?” The retainers replied: “They are also used to kill people with. In times of war when men are fighting each other these spears are used at close quarters by thrusting, and at long range by throwing, at the enemy. These spears in the hands of strong men can be thrown for some distance. If the person on the other side is of great skill he could ward off one or more spears at a time, and in that way avoid being hit.” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “Yes, those things are of some value; but the person who can skilfully ward them off is of more importance. These things of my father’s are of some value; therefore, if my navel string is still in your keeping, then tie it together with my father’s bundle of war spears.”"
"A lohe o Lonoikamakahiki i keia olelo a ke kahu, he mea puiwa loa ia nona, no kona lohe ana i ka olelo, he hiki ke ike i ke alii waiwai, ame ka waiwai ole, a nolaila, olelo aku la oia i kona mau kahu, me ka i aku: “A, e ike mai no auanei kela elemakule la ia’u?” I aku na kahuna: “Ae, aole oe e nalo, a me kau hana mahope aku.” I hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i na kahu: “He kanaka kapu anei kela, aole e kamailio ia aku e kamalii? O na kanaka makua wale no anei?” I aku la na kahu: “Nau e kamailio kela elemakule, i malamaia hoi na kakaolelo ame na kahuna no oukou no na ’lii.”","When Lonoikamakahiki heard these remarks from one of his retainers he was greatly impressed that such a thing could be possible, that is, that the man could tell whether a chief will become rich or poor. He therefore asked of his attendants: “And will that old man be able to recognize me?” The attendants: “Yes, he will not overlook you12 and also your doings in the future.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked them: “Is there any restriction placed on that man, that is, something that will prevent young people from addressing him? And are the grown up people the only ones that are allowed to speak to him?” The attendants replied: “You are indeed privileged to address that old man. Counselors and priests are retained and cared for to be used by the chiefs.”"
"Penei ke mele a Makuakaumana i oli aku ai i Tahiti, ia laua me Paao i holo ai i alii hou no Hawaii, no ka mea, ua pau na alii mua o Hawaii nei i ka hewa, o Kapawa ke alii o Hawaii nei ia manawa, i ke kanaha o na hanauna alii mai a Opuukahonua mai a ia Kapawa. A ia Makuakaumana ma i aneane aku ai e kau i ke awa o Moaulanuiakea ia manawa i oli aku ai o Makuakaumana ia Lonokaeho ke kahuna:","This is how the song runs that Makuakaumana chanted at Tahiti, when he and Paao went to get a new chief for Hawaii nei, because all the old chiefs of Hawaii had sinned, Kapawa being the king of Hawaii at that time, he being of the fortieth generation from the time of Opuukahonua. When Makuakaumana and company were nearing the beach in the harbor of Moaulanuiakea then Makuakaumana chanted to Lonokaeho, the priest of that place:"
"Ma ka hoonohonoho ana i ka mookuauhau mai a Opuukahonua mai, aole i ikeia ko Opuukahonua mau makua, aka, o ka mea i oleloia i loko o ka moolelo o Kualii, mai Tahiti mai o Opuukahonua o ka hele ana mai a noho i Hawaii nei, i ka manawa, aole he kanaka ma keia mau aina. Holo mai o Opuukahonua me kona mau kaikaina elua, o Lolomu a me Mihi, hookahi wahine o Lana, a o lakou na kupuna mua o Hawaii nei. A penei ka laha ana:","In the genealogical tree of Opuukahonua it is not stated who his parents were, but, it is stated in the genealogy of Kualii, that Opuukahonua came from Tahiti to live in Hawaii when these islands were inhabited by human beings. Opuukahonua came with his two younger brothers Lolomu and Mihi and one woman, Lana, and they became the progenitors of the people of Hawaii nei, and this is how they increased:"
"No ka mea, i ka wa i kiiia mai ai o Iwikauikaua e Kanaloapulehu e kau i ka lele, no ka hewa ana o Iwikauikaua no ke kipi ana i na ’lii malalo ona, a kipi aku ia Kanaloakuaana kekahi alii o Maui, a nolaila, ia Iwikauikaua i ku ai iluna o ka anuu, nana ae la o Iwikauikaua i ke kahuna ia Kukailani, a kahea aku la: “E, ka pule a ke kahuna, kulia i mua o ke akua, na na mai ia’u ina he kahuna oe na’u.” A lohe o Kukailani i keia mea: “Ae, e ku wau i kuu pule a i ino kuu pule make oe, aka i hololea kuu pule a hiki i ka amama ana; aole oe e kau i ka lele i keia la.” A penei ka pule ana:","On the day when Iwikauikaua was taken by Kanaloapulehu to be sacrificed on the altar of the temple, because Iwikauikaua had done wrong in promoting rebellion amongst the subordinate chiefs under him to rebel against Kanaloakuaana, a king of Maui, then when Iwikauikaua stood on the steps of the altar he looked to the priest, Kukailani and appealed to him: “O prayer of the priest, stand thou before the deity that he may look towards me, if thou art indeed my priest.” When Kukailani heard this call he answered: “Yes, I will stand and pray, but if my prayer is not propitious you will die; but if my prayer is uninterrupted to the Amen you will not die today.”"
"O keia ka pule i oleloia i loko o ka molelo o Kamalalawalu. A ma keia mele pule i maopopo ai he pono ke mahele i mau wa. No ka mea, aia wale no ma na ’lii aimoku e ili ai ke kapu moku. A mehe mea la, ua hoomaopopoia na wa ma ia mau ano e like me na pauku mele pule maluna ae.","This is the prayer that is referred to in the genealogy of Kamalalawalu. And it is shown by the construction of this poetical prayer that time should be divided into epochs. Because it is only on the reigning kings that the kapu of the islands are conferred, and it would seem time and epochs were divided as shown by the division of the chant referred to above."
"Ua oleloia ma ka moolelo o Hawaii nei, i paiia ma Lahainaluna, a me ka moolelo i hooponopono hou ia e Mr. Pokuea o Lahainaluna, ua ku mua mai kekahi moku ma Hawaii nei i ka wa kahiko, a oia ka hoomaka mua ana o keia lahui e ike i na haole.

This is how that is recognized by his prayer in the middle of his history as recited below:"
"Mai ka hiapo a ka mua ponoi o Aukelenuiaiku, aole o Iku i hii, aole i lawelawe, aole hoi i hooili i ka aina no kekahi o lakou, aole no hoi i hoopunahele. A ia Aukelenuiaiku, malama o Iku, lawelawe a hii, a hooili i kona kapu a me ka aina nona. A no keia punahele o Aukelenuiaiku i ko lakou makuakane, ua huhu kona mau hoahanau ia ia, a ua imi lakou i mea nona e make ai.

But at the birth of Aukelenuiaiku, Iku took the greatest interest in him, took care of him, took him up in his arms, and to him he willed all his honor and glory and the kingdom. Because of this show of favoritism on their father’s part toward Aukelenuiaiku, his brothers and sister hated him and they tried to devise some way of getting rid of him. Said the oldest of the children, Kamakahinuiaiku:4 “Yes, our father is indeed strange; although I am the first-born, still our father did not promise to leave me his honor and glory, and not even the kingdom, but here with the last son he has promised to leave these things to him.”"
"Maanei e ike ai kakou i ka poino o Aukelenuiaiku, a me kona pakele ana i ka make a kona kaikuaana kuhu, aloha ole. A haule o Aukelenuiaiku i loko o ka lua, kahea iho ua kaikuaana huhu la, penei: “E, Kamooinanea e, eia mai ko ai la, ai ia mai.” Ia ia e kahea ana, holo mai la kekahi kaikuaana o Aukelenuiaiku (he kaikuaana aloha ia ia), kahea iho la ma ka waha o ka lua: “E, Kamooinanea e! mai ai mai oe, o ko moopuna mai na o Aukelenuiaiku e lele aku la.” Ma keia haule ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua olioli loa kona poe kaikuaana huhu ia ia, no kona make ana, e manao ana lako ua make io no o Aukelenuiaiku. Ma keia haule ana o Aukelenuiaiku, manao lakou, ua lilo kona kapu i mea ole, a ua nele ka olelo hooilina a ko lakou makuakane maluna ona, a ua lilo i mea ole loa.","We will here see how Aukelenuiaiku got into trouble and how he escaped the terrible death intended for him by his cruel and merciless brothers. As Aukelenuiaiku was falling down the pit, the angry brother called out: “Say, Kamooinanea, here is your food; eat him up.” While he was calling, one of his younger brothers, a kind one, came up running and called down the pit, saying: “Say, Kamooinanea, don’t eat him up, for he is your own grandson, Aukelenuiaiku, that is being thrown down.” After Aukelenuiaiku had fallen into the pit his older brothers were much pleased, believing that they had now gotten rid of him; that he was really dead; and their father’s promise on him would be unfulfilled, and become utterly void."
"Ia lakou e kamailio ana, hoea hou mai la ua moo nei, a kahea mai la: “E, Aukelenuiaiku e, e haawi mai oe i kekahi kanaka na’u.” Hoole aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Aole e loaa aku ia oe ke kanaka.” A lohe ua moo nei i keia olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, i mai la ia: “E haawi mai oe ia’u i hookahi kanaka, i aha kau uku o ka hiki ana mai i anei? no ka mea, ua haawi ia mai oe he kanaka make, e ai aku wau ia oe, aka, nana ae nei au ia oe, a o ka mea i puka pono aku mai loko o’u, nolaila, aole au e ai aku ia oe.” Ma keia olelo a ua moo la, ua ae aku o Aukelenuiaiku, a ua manao iho la ia e hooko i ka olelo a kona kupunawahine moo, a Kamooinanea.

A pau na kanaka elua, koe iho la o Aukelenuiaiku, ia wa, hoi mai la ua moo nei a noho i luna.","While the men were still conversing the lizard again made its appearance and called out: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, let me have one of the men.” Aukelenuiaiku again refused, saying: “No, you cannot have one of them.” When the lizard heard this it said: “You must give me one of the men. What are you going to pay me for coming here? Because you have been given to me to be killed and that I should devour you, but since I have found out that you are one of those that have gone out of my own body, I cannot eat you up.” When the lizard concluded, Aukelenuiaiku gave his consent, for he thought within himself that the request of his lizard grandmother, Kamooinanea, should be granted. He then gave one of the men to the lizard. As soon as the man was offered, he was swallowed whole. After this first man was consumed the lizard again asked that the second man be given her. Aukelenuiaiku again gave the second man, and he too was swallowed whole. After the second man was consumed there was left only Aukelenuiaiku. The lizard then came out of the sea and laid on the dry sand."
"A pau ka olelo ana a ka moo ia Aukelenuiaiku, alaila, kapili iho la ia i pahu no ke ’kua o Aukelenuiaiku, a paa ka pahu, hoo iho la ia i ke ’kua i loko, oia o Lonoikoualii.

Eia ka auanei o Namakaokahai no.","At the end of the remarks of the lizard to Aukelenuiaiku, she made a box to hold the god of Aukelenuiaiku. After the box was built she put the god into it, who was Lonoikoualii, and said to Aukelenuiaiku: “With this god you will conquer and become possessed of the land that I have just described. Here is your food and meat; it is a laukahi. This leaf is wholesome; as soon as you touch it to your lips your hunger is satisfied; and when satisfied you can go without eating for a period of four months.” The grandmother then took up an axe and a knife and put them into the box. The lizard next cut off its tail and gave it to the grandson, saying: “This is my real body, which you must take with you. Here are also my pau of feathers and my feather kahili which shall act as your preserver when you meet your cousin. With these things in your possession—that is, by wearing the pau and holding this kahili you will cause your enemies to fall and turn into ashes.” The lizard then explained the uses of all the different things to her grandson, and she also taught him how to preserve these things of magic; but she did not tell him the name of the cousin. She was Namakaokahai."
"A make o Aukelenuiaiku, hoi aku la ua kaikuaana la, a hiki i kahi a na kaikaina e noho ana.

When the brother who entertained some love for Aukelenuiaiku saw their oldest brother coming back, he asked: “Where is our brother?” The oldest brother replied: “I have not seen him, and he was not at the place where I went to.” After this the brother who wished to save Aukelenuiaiku got up and went out in search of him. In this search he went to their home, where he learned that Aukelenuiaiku had not returned. He then took up the loin cloth of his brother, and wore it round his neck and wept. While he was weeping their father Iku heard it, and so he inquired: “Who is this weeping?” “I, Ikumailani.” “What are you weeping for?” “I am weeping for Aukelenuiaiku; he is dead.” When their father heard this he also wept.""Maanei e hoomaopopo ai kakou i ko Piikea mau hoahanau; o ka mua o Piilani, he kane ia, o kona muli o Piikea (nona keia olelo ana); o Kihapiilani kona muli iho, he kane, o Kalaniapiilani kona muli iho he kane no, ua make mua nae ia.

The first-born of the family was Piilani, a boy; the one following after him was Piikea whom we have already been introduced to as the wife of Umi. Following her was Kihapiilani, another boy; and the last of the family was Kalanipiilani, also a boy, who died young. Piilani was the heir to the kingdom of Maui, while his younger brother and sister, Kihapiilani and Piikea, were placed under him. This was the expressed will of Piilani to them, but Piilani disregarded the words of their father."
"Ia Piilani e noho ana i ka aina o Maui a puni, noho pu iho la ia me kona kaikaina me Kihapiilani ma Kauiki, ma Hana. Ma keia noho ana, aole malama o Piilani i kona pokii, e like me ke kauoha a ko lakou makuakane, mamua ae o ka wa make.

While living together Piilani did not care for his brother according to the instructions of their father before his death. It was customary with Piilani while eating, or sitting in company, to care more for the others than his brother Kihapiilani. Every time his brother was around he would show a marked degree of hatred towards him, and he evinced his displeasure in many ways."
"I kekahi la, e ai ana o Piilani me kona mau hoa ai, he poe e wale no, aia i mua o lakou ka ai a me ka ia; a o Kihapiilani hoi kona pokii, aole ana ia e ai ana; aka, aia i mua o kona alo, he ipu ohua, na Piilani; lalau aku la ia elua ohua a ai iho la. Ma keia ai ana a Kihapiilani, ike mai la o Piilani; lalau mai la ia i ka ipukai ohua a paa i ka lima, ninau mai la o Piilani: “Nawai la i ai iho nei i ka ipukai ohua?” I aku o Kihapiilani: “Na’u no, no ka mea aole a’u ia.” Ia wa kiola o Piilani i ka ipukai ohua, me ke kai o loko a pa i ka lae o Kihapiilani, naha ae la ka ipukai ohua, a paumaele ka maka i ke kai o ka ohua, a wewela loa iho la.","One day while Piilani was eating with his companions, all strangers, enjoying the good things placed before them, Kihapiilani, although present at the table, was not served with any of the good things; but, in front of him was placed a small calabash containing some small fish. This dish belonged to Piilani. Seeing that this was all there was to be had within reach, he reached into the dish and took out two small fish and ate them. While doing this he was seen by Piilani. Piilani then reached for the dish and held it up in his hand, then asked of Kihapiilani: “Who ate of the fish in this dish?” Kihapiilani replied: “I did, because there was nothing else for me to eat.” Piilani then threw the dish with the fish in it, brine and all, at the forehead of his brother, breaking the dish into pieces and spattering the fish and brine into the eyes of Kihapiilani which blinded him for a while."
"No keia hana ino aloha ole a kona kaikuaana ia ia, hele aku la ia me ka mahuka, a noho ma Kalaniwai ma Makawao. I ko Kihapiilani noho ana ma laila, moe iho la ia ma laila i ka wahine, aole nae lakou i ike o Kihapiilani keia, he ’lii, aka, i ko lakou manao, he kanaka kuaaina loa. Nolaila, olelo na makuahunowai o Kihapiilani, i ka palaualelo, i ka moe wale iho no i ka hale, aole hana.

Ina hookahi anuenue, alaila, he kahuna; aka, ina elua, he ’lii.” Ma keia noonoo o laua, ua holo ia laua, he ’lii, a ua lohe ia no hoi ka nalowale ana o Kihapiilani.","Because of this ill treatment by his elder brother, showing no love or respect for him, Kihapiilani got up and secretly ran away to Kalaniwai, a place in Makawao. While there he met a woman belonging to the place and they were united and lived as husband and wife. The people of the place, however, did not know that this was Kihapiilani, the chief, but took him to be a man from the country. While living with his wife’s parents he was often spoken of as a lazy fellow, spending his time sleeping instead of going out to work. When Kihapiilani heard his wife’s parents speak of him [ ] as being a lazy fellow, he got up and went down to get potato stalks in the lowlands of Kaluaama at Haiku. Upon his arrival at this place, an old man by the name of Kukuiokaaulani saw him and recognized him as of high rank; so he said to his companion, another old man: “Say, that man that is coming down is either a chief or a priest.” After a while he again remarked: “It must be a chief. If there was but one rainbow, then it would be a priest; but since there are two it must surely be a chief.” The two finally decided that the person was a chief, for the fact of the disappearance of Kihapiilani was well known. The two old men then waited for the approach of the stranger. As soon as he came up to them they greeted him, saying: “Our salutation to the chief.” Kihapiilani then admonished them, saying: “Be quiet. Since you two have recognized me you must not reveal my identity.”"
"Noho iho la laua a hiki mai la o Kihapiilani, aloha aku la laua: “Aloha ke ’lii.” Hamau aku la o Kihapiilani: “Hamau ko olua mau waha; he nani ia, ua ike iho la olua ia’u, e huna olua ia’u, mai hoike olua.” A pau ka halawai ana me na elemakule, iho aku la keia a hiki i Kaluaama, malaila ka lau uala e ulu ana, ako iho la o Kihapiilani. Ma keia ako ana a Kihapiilani, lalau iho la ia i ka lau o ka pue uala, a pua ae la a paa, apahu ae la, me ke koe ole o kekahi lau uala, no ka pue.","After this Kihapiilani continued on his way until he came to Kaluaama, where a large patch of sweet potatoes was growing. Kihapiilani then proceeded to pick a quantity of stalks, taking and breaking them from the vines, leaving the hills bare. While he was thus busily picking stalks the owner of the patch arrived, and upon seeing what Kihapiilani was doing he came up to him and began beating him with a stick, but Kihapiilani paid no attention to his beating but kept on picking stalks. After he had picked a quantity sufficient for his purpose he tied them into a large pack, placed the pack on to his back and started for the uplands of Kalaniwai."
"Ia ia e ako ana, hiki mai la ka mea nana ka mala uala, a ike iho la ia, kumakena, hahau mai la ia ia Kihapiilani i ka laau, aole nae ona eueu ae. Hana iho la o Kihapiilani i kana lau uala a haawe, hoi aku la i uka o Kalaniwai.

Ninau hou laua: “Heaha ka huakai nui a ke ’lii o ka hele ana mai?” Wahi a Kihapiilani: “He makaia no kuu kaikuaana no Piilani, o ia ka’u e imi nei.” Hai aku la ke ’lii o Kihapiilani i ka hana a kona kaikuaana. A lohe na elemakule, i aku la laua ia Kihapiilani: “Ua make ko kaikuaana, aole e ola; aia ka mea e make ai, o keia hale e hamama mai la ka puka i Waikapu.

The old men then asked him again: “What is the object of the chief’s journey to these parts?” Kihapiilani replied: “I am seeking for someone to kill my brother Piilani. That is the object of my search.” Kihapiilani then related the incident of the insult which caused Kihapiilani to seek revenge. When the old men heard this they said: “Your older brother is as good as dead; he shall not live. Go to that house whose door is opened toward Waikapu; there you will find our sister, Pao by name. Upon your arrival at the place she will direct you what to do next, then you will gain your object and your older brother will be at your mercy.” Kihapiilani agreed to follow out the advice of the old men and said: “I will go along home and plant my potato stalks: after that has been done, then I will carry out your instructions.”"
"[Olelo hoakaka: maloko o keia mele i haku ia, ua komo no ka moolelo o ko Maui mau alii, a ua pili no hoi ka haku ana i na ’lii o Maui.]",[A word is here necessary in reference to the composition of this mele. The history of the kings of Maui is mentioned in this chant and the composition of it was made solely for the Maui kings.]
"Ma keia kakau ana, e olelo hou ia ka olelo maanei no Kihapiilani. A pau ka olelo a na elemakule ia Kihapiilani, hoi aku la ia a hiki mauka o Kalaniwai, kanu iho la i kana mala uala.

A oo ka uala, haawi aku la ia i ka wahine, a me na makuahunowai.","We will now continue with the story of Kihapiilani. At the close of the conversation between the old men and Kihapiilani, he continued on his way to the uplands of Kalaniwai, where he began planting his potato stalks. For some time Kihapiilani devoted his whole time to the cultivation of his fields, until his season of want was finally passed, for he felt bitterly the shame and insult shown him by his wife’s parents when he was called a lazy fellow. When the potatoes were at last matured he turned them over to his wife and her parents."
"Maanei e maopopo ai ko Kihapiilani imi ana i makaia nona, e paio ai me kona kaikuaana lokoino, me Piilani.","We will now see how Kihapiilani made the search for the one to avenge the insult given him by his unkind brother, Piilani."
"Mahope o ka Kihapiilani olelo i ka wahine no ka mala uala, olelo aku la ia i kana wahine, penei: “E kuu wahine, e hele ana wau, haalele au ia oe, he nani ia, ua mahi iho la au i ka ai a oo, nau no e ai ka luhi o kaua.” I mai ka wahine: “O kou hele no keia hele loa, aole oe e hoi mai ana?” Ae aku la ke kane: “Ae, aole au e hoi mai, a kau, a hooilo; ina he manao kane kou, e noho kane ole oe a hoi mai au.” Ma keia mau olelo a Kihapiilani, aua loa iho la kana wahine, me ka ae ole e hele.

Ma keia mau olelo a Kihapiilani, maopopo i ka wahine he ’lii keia kane ana, he ’lii nui; alaila, pau kona manao ana i ka noho, ae aku la ia e hele o Kihapiilani.","After Kihapiilani had spoken to his wife relative to the field of potatoes, he said to her: “My wife, I am going away and shall leave you. I have labored patiently in the cultivation and care of these fields until they are ripened. You will eat the fruit of our labor.” The wife replied: “Are you going away for good, then, and are you not coming back again?” The husband replied: “Yes, I am not coming back for [ ] a summer and a winter. If you have husband-regard, remain husbandless until my return.” When the wife heard this she held Kihapiilani back and refused to allow him to go. Because of this stubbornness on his wife’s part he told her everything concerning himself in order to overcome her opposition, so he said: “My wife, I am now going to reveal certain things to you which you must not repeat, and I also urge upon you not to reveal my name. I am Kihapiilani; I am going in search of some one who will kill my brother Lonoapii (Piilani).” When the wife heard this she then knew that her husband was Kihapiilani, the great chief; and she also knew that it was beyond her to withhold him from going, so she consented for him to go on his way."
"Maanei e hoomaopopo ai kakou i ko Piikea mau hoahanau; o ka mua o Piilani, he kane ia, o kona muli o Piikea (nona keia olelo ana); o Kihapiilani kona muli iho, he kane, o Kalaniapiilani kona muli iho he kane no, ua make mua nae ia.

The first-born of the family was Piilani, a boy; the one following after him was Piikea whom we have already been introduced to as the wife of Umi. Following her was Kihapiilani, another boy; and the last of the family was Kalanipiilani, also a boy, who died young. Piilani was the heir to the kingdom of Maui, while his younger brother and sister, Kihapiilani and Piikea, were placed under him. This was the expressed will of Piilani to them, but Piilani disregarded the words of their father."

While Kihapiilani was yet on the road, on his way to meet her, she predicted to those around her, saying: “There is a chief on the way here in search for some one to help him in his revenge.”"
"A hiki o Kihapiilani i mua o Pao, ku iho la ke anuenue ia wa hookahi. Pane mai la o Pao: “Mama kuu haku.” Aloha aku la o Pao, aloha mai la o Kihapiilani, a pau ke aloha, hookipa aku la o Pao ia Kihapiilani.

Pao then said: “My lord is swift of foot.” She then greeted Kihapiilani. Kihapiilani returned the greeting. After the greetings had been exchanged, Pao invited Kihapiilani to come in, and then she asked him: “What brings my lord here on this hot day?” The chief replied: “I have come in search of someone who will cause the death of my brother Piilani, for he has treated me shamefully.” Pao then replied: “There in the lowlands of Kalepolepo lives the one who will assist you in killing your enemy. You go down till you reach Kalepolepo and look for a man whose face is covered over with filth. He is the one.” At the close of the directions of Pao, Kihapiilani proceeded on his way to Kalepolepo, where in time he found the man described to him and he went up to meet him. As he was approaching the man, the man saw him and said: “What is the object of the chief’s journey that has brought him here?” The chief, Kihapiilani, then said: “I have come to your presence by the direction of the prophetess Pao, for she told me that you have the means of fulfilling my desire, that is, something that will aid me in killing my brother Piilani, the one who has shamelessly abused me.”"

When the preparation was complete, Kihapiilani boarded the canoe and they set sail for Hawaii, to meet his sister Piikea and his brother-in-law Umi. That same evening they landed at Waipio. As soon as they landed, Kihapiilani proceeded to the house where Piikea was living and entered it. When his sister saw him, she sprang on him and wept. At the end of their weeping Piikea asked: “How are you getting along with your brother?” Kihapiilani answered his sister, saying: “We do not get along at all; my brother ill-treats me; he gets angry, abuses me, and has no love for me. That is why I have come to you, to tell you of these things.” When Piikea heard this, she cried in a loud voice, recounting their life in their early days while living with their parents and of their childhood wanderings here and there, carefree and happy. While Piikea was wailing, Umi, who was in another house, heard it and he wondered why his wife was crying; but after a while he was told that it was because his brother-in-law, Kihapiilani had arrived. Soon after [ ] this Piikea came out of her house, still crying in a loud voice, and began disrobing and acting the part of one bereft of her mind. In doing this, Piikea was but acting her part; she had her senses about her all right enough, but she did this to impress on her husband Umi that a very great wrong had been committed, to rouse him to action."
"A pau ka Piikea uwe ana, ninau mai la o Umi: “Heaha kou mea i uwe ai me ka leo nui, a me kou kuu ana i kou wahi hilahila?” I aku o Piikea: “No ka nui o ko’u aloha i ko’u kaikunane; akahi no maua a halawai kino, a no ko’u lohe ana mai nei i ka hana ino o kona kaikuaana, o Piilani, ia ia; nolaila, nui ko’u aloha, a o ia ke kumu o ko’u kuu ana i ko’u mai nona.

Ia wa, olelo aku la o Umi i kona mau hoakuka kaua, oia o Omaokamau, Piimaiwaa, Koi, e hoomakaukau i na waa, no ka holo i Maui e kaua ai me Piilani.","At the end of the wailing, Umi came up to her and asked her: “What is it that has made you cry out so loud and why have you disrobed yourself?” Piikea answered: “Because of the great love I bear my brother; this is the first time that we have met after such a long separation; and also because I am grieved at the ill-treatment given him by his brother Piilani. Because of this treatment I became so worked up that I wanted to show my great grief. We must therefore go and make war on Piilani.” When Umi heard this, he said: “I don’t think it proper for us to go and make war on Piilani, because he is your own brother; he is not connected to you from a distance, a mere relative.” Piikea said: “If you will not give your consent to my request, to go and make war on Piilani, then it would be far better for me to die than to live.” At this, Umi decided that he must obey his wife’s demand and so he gave his consent. Umi then summoned his war counselors, Omaokamau, Piimaiwaa and Koi, and gave them orders to prepare the fleet of war canoes for a trip to Maui to make war on Piilani."
"Aohe makau o keia mau kanaka ekolu, ua aa lakou e holo i Maui e kaua ai, aka, o ke ’lii o Umi, ua hopohopo ia no Imaikalani, no ka mea, he kanaka akamai loa ia i ke koa, ka oo ihe, a he kanaka ikaika loa, oia ko oi ma Maui, i loko o ia kau, a o ke kela ia mai Hawaii a Niihau.","These three men were undaunted; they did not hesitate, but immediately set out to obey the order of their king, for they were anxious to go to Maui to do battle, although Umi was doubtful about mastering Imaikalani, for he was a very skilful warrior and was well versed in all the arts of warfare, and especially in spear throwing. He was a very powerful man, and he was the greatest man in all of Maui at that time, and he was credited as being the strongest man from Hawaii to Niihau."
"Ia wa, ui ae o Umi i kana kahuna akamai, kaulana, oia o Kaoleioku: “Pehea keia holo i Maui e kaua me Piilani?” I aku o Kaoleioku: “E ke ’lii e, e holo no oe e kaua ia Maui, aole alii nana oe e kaua mai; he kaua na ka makaainana, pio no ia oe, aole e eha ka ili.”","When the preparations were about completed, Umi questioned his great and famous priest, Kaoleioku, saying: “How about this voyage to Maui to fight Piilani?” Kaoleioku said: “Chief, you may go and make war on Maui, for there is no king to oppose you; it is going to be a war of the common people; you will surely win, and, furthermore, your skin will not be bruised.”"
"A lohe o Umi i keia mau olelo a kona kahuna mana, a Kaoleioku, oluolu iho la ia.

He then ordered his chiefs who had charge of the different districts, to get the fleet of war canoes in readiness and to get the men under them ready and to all come together in one place. After several tens of days passed they finally reported that the canoes and men were ready to start out. It was said that the men were so numerous that they could not be counted."
"A makaukau na waa, holo mai la lakou mai Waipio mai a pae ma Kapueokahi i Maui. Ma keia holo ana o na waa, ua komo ka maka mua o na waa ma Kapueokahi ma Hana, Maui, a o ka maka hope o na waa, ma ke awa o Waipio i Hawaii. [ ]","As soon as the preparations were perfected, the canoes left Waipio and set sail for Maui, landing at Kapueokahi. On this expedition, while the first of the canoes were entering the harbor of Kapueokahi the last of the fleet was still in the harbor at Waipio, Hawaii. [ ]"
"I ka hiki ana o na waa ma Kapueokahi i Maui, ike mai la na kamaaina i ka lehulehu o na waa, makau iho la lakou.

He keiki nae kana o Kalaninuikupuapaikalaninui, ia ia o Maui ia wa.","When the people of Maui saw the great fleet of canoes coming into the harbor at Kapueokahi they were sore afraid. Shortly after this word was received and passed from place to place that it was Umi and his wife Piikea come to make war on Piilani. Piilani, however, was dead at this time, but he had a son by the name of Kalaninuikupuapaikalaninui, who was the king of Maui at this time."
"A lohe na kamaaina a pau o Hana, holo aku la lakou i luna o ka puu o Kauiki e noho ai. I aku o Umi ia Piikea kana wahine, aole make kaua, no ka mea, ua make o Piilani.

Ia manawa kena o Umi i kona mau koa kaulana, oia o Omaokamau, Piimaiwaa, Koi, e hele e kaua ma ka puu kaua o Kauiki.","When the people of Hana heard that the canoes were on a war expedition they all ran to the top of the Kauiki hill and stayed there. Umi said to Piikea, his wife: “Let us not make war on Maui as Piilani is already dead.” The reason why Umi did not wish to make war was because he took pity on the son born of Piilani, for Umi thought that it would be proper for the young man to have charge of the kingdom, and that Piikea and Kihapiilani be the parents, but Piikea stubbornly refused to have anything of the kind; she wanted to make war until the son of Piilani was killed, because she reasoned that if this young man was allowed to live there would be more fighting in the future. When Umi saw that it was useless to try to change his wife’s mind, he ordered his three chief officers, Omaokamau, Piimaiwaa and Koi to go and make war on the stronghold of Kauiki."

To the top of this hill a ladder was built on one side, a sort of small bridge made so as to entrap those trying to take the hill, that if those from below were to climb up in attack stones would be rolled down on them, thereby injuring them. Furthermore, a large wooden image was hewed out and made to stand at night, and served the purpose of a guard. The image was called Kawalakii, and this great statue kept the warriors below from climbing the hill at night."

O ke kowa ma waena o Omaokamau a me ua kanaka ala, elua haneri me kanaha kapuai ka loa.","Omaokamau was the first of Umi’s men who attempted to climb the Kauiki hill. When he came up to the place where the ladder could be seen he saw that a three-cornered rock was fastened at its top. When let go the rock would roll directly down, which would kill the person attempting to go up the ladder. Therefore Omaokamau became afraid and gave up the idea of climbing the ladder, so he thought deeply of a plan to accomplish this, but without success. After thinking for some time he decided that a night attempt to ascend the hill would be the best. When it became quite dark Omaokamau rose and went up to the point where he could distinctly see the ladder; when he arrived at the place he looked and saw a very large man, very tall, about eight feet, holding a long, large war club in his hand. The war club was longer and larger than the war club carried by himself. He also saw that the man had a loin [ ] cloth girded around his waist and drawn very tight. The distance between Omaokamau and the man was about 240 feet. When Omaokamau saw the man and the size of his war club fear and doubt entered his breast; he believed that if he was hit by that war club he would be knocked to pieces, so he was afraid to venture any further and decided to return."
"Ma keia ike ana o Omaokamau, komo mai ka makau a me ka hopohopo i loko ona no ka nui a me ka loihi o ka laau palau; e manao ia, ina e hahau ia ia, alaila, e [ ] kau liilii ia i ka laau palau; nolaila, makau o Omaokamau a hoi i lalo. A hiki o Omaokamau i lalo, ninau mai la ke ’lii o Umi: “Pehea kau pii ana aku nei i luna?” I aku o Omaokamau: “Pehea mai kau e ke ’lii. Ua ike aku nei au i kela kanaka, nui launa ole, aole kanaka ma Hawaii e like me kela kanaka; nui no a nui, loa no a loa, o kana laau palau loihi launa ole, ina e hahau mai he paki liilii loa ko ke kanaka i ka make.”","When Omaokamau reached the bottom of the hill Umi asked him: “How did you get along with your ascent of the hill?” Omaokamau answered: “Don’t think, O chief, that it will be possible for us to capture that hill. I have seen that man up on the hill; he is of incomparable size. There is no man in Hawaii like him; he is the largest of the largest, the tallest of the tallest, and his war club is the largest I have ever seen; if it should hit any one that person would be smashed to pieces.”"
"Maanei, e kuka kamailio iki kakou no keia kuhihewa o Omaokamau. He kii ka mea ana i kuhihewa ai, o Kawalakii. Ua akamai loa ka hana ana a ke ’lii o Maui i keia mea, a ua lilo ua kii la i ka po i kiai no ka puu o Kauiki, e malu ai i na enemi o lalo ke pii aku i ka po. A ua maluhia ka puu o Kauiki, i kona mau po e kiai ana me ka ike ole ia he kii; aka, i ka wa i ike ia ai, ua pio.","We will here speak of this mistaken idea of Omaokamau. The large man he saw was the wooden image, Kawalakii. The attempt of the king of Maui to frighten away the Hawaii warriors from a night attack was quite successful, for it proved a good watchman at night for the Kauiki hill, to guard against enemies if ascending at night. This hill of Kauiki was quite safe as long as the deception prevailed; but when it was at last discovered the hill was easily captured."
"A lohe o Umi i ka Omaokamau mau olelo akena, hoouna ae la ia ia Koi, e pii i luna o ka puu o Kauiki, a pii aku la o Koi i ka puu, hoaa wale aku la no a hoi mai la i ke ao.","When Umi heard the report of Omaokamau relating to the large man, he sent Koi to see if he could manage to get to the top of Kauiki hill. He made his climb in the day time, but after several attempts he returned and waited for the night."
"A po iho, pii hou o Koi, a hiki i kahi a Omaokamau i hoi mai ai, i nana aku kona hana, e ku mai ana keia kanaka nui, ua like me ka Omaokamau mea i olelo mua mai ai, ia lakou; nolaila makau iho la ia. Ua like ko Koi manao me ko Omaokamau manao e kuhi ana no he kanaka maoli, aohe manao he kii. Nolaila, hoi mai la o Koi a hiki i lalo i o Umi la, ninau mai la ke ’lii o Umi: “Pehea kau pii ana aku nei e Koi i luna o ka puu o Kauiki?” “E ke ’lii e, o ka manao kau he kanaka kela a kanaka; he oi kela o ka loihi, o ka nui, aole a’u kanaka i ike ai mai ko’u la i ike ai i ke kanaka a hiki i keia la; ua like me nei ke kino a me ka nui, he keu keia, he weliweli ke nana aku, a nolaila au i hoi mai la.”","At the approach of night Koi again made another attempt, but when he got as far as the place where Omaokamau saw the large man he went no further, for he, too, looked and saw the large man standing guard, just as Omaokamau had described to them; so he, too, became afraid and returned. Like Omaokamau, he thought that the man was real, never thinking that it was only an image. Koi therefore returned and when he arrived in the presence of Umi he was asked: “How did you make out when you climbed the hill?” “Say, O chief, don’t think that that man is an ordinary man; he is the tallest man I have ever seen, in size; I have not seen any one since I have been old enough to see a man that will equal him; this is the greatest, and he is terrible to behold; so I decided to come back.”"
"A pau ka Koi olelo ana ia Umi, no kona pii ana, alaila, he mea kaumaha loa ia i ko ke ’lii manao. Ia wa, olelo aku la ke ’lii o Umi ia Piimaiwaa, e pii i luna o ka puu o Kauiki.

Ia lakou e hailuku ana i na pohaku, ia wa o Piimaiwaa i olokaa ai i kana laau palau, ia Wahie. Ma keia hana a Piimaiwaa, aole oia i pa i na pohaku e iho makawalu mai ana ia ia, aka, ua hoomau no o Piimaiwaa i ka okaa i kana laau ia Wahie. Pela no kona hele koa ana a komo pono malalo o ka hulili mawaena o ka puu o Kauiki, kahi a ka lehulehu e nou mai ana i na pohaku.","At the close of Koi’s report to Umi relating to his climb, it was seen that Umi was sad at heart. After a time he ordered Piimaiwaa to ascend the hill of Kauiki. At the order Piimaiwaa rose and started on his expedition. When he reached the ladder he saw a large body of men there assembled all prepared with their implements [ ] of war, such as long spears, short spears, darts, war clubs, slings, pikoi, stones, sticks, and various other things. He also saw the three-cornered rock called the “moa.” When Piimaiwaa drew near to the men they began to throw stones at him. While the people were throwing stones at him he started to twirl his war club, Wahie, warding off the stones; he was not hit once, for he kept on twirling his club. He kept on advancing until he got right under the ladder which hung against the cliff, where the men who were stoning him were stationed."
"O ka hulili, he kanaono kapuai kona keikie, a malalo o laila o Piimaiwaa i ku ai me ka puke i kana laau palau, i ua hulili la. Ma keia ku ana o Piimaiwaa, ua hoomau mai kona mau enemi i ka hailuku i na pohaku ia ia, aka, aole ia i pa ike, no kona koa loa a me ka makau ole.","The ladder was about sixty feet long and it was at the foot of it that Piimaiwaa stood protecting himself with his club. By this stand of Piimaiwaa his enemies continued to hurl stones upon him without his being hit at all, on account of his great bravery and fearlessness. After standing there for some time he turned and ran down the hill at great speed and barely escaped from the many stones thrown at him."
"A liuliu kona ku ana ma laila, holo mai la oia mai laila mai, i lalo me ka mama loa, a pakele mahunehune mai la ia i na pohaku e iho makawalu mai ana i luna ona. A hiki oia i lalo i kahi o Umi e noho ana, ninau mai la o Umi: “Pehea kau pii ana aku nei?” Olelo mai la o Piimaiwaa: “Kahaha. Ua hele au a hiki i ka hulili, a paio pu me ka Ohiaokealakona.” Ma keia mau olelo a Piimaiwaa, ua nui ka poe i hooiaio mai. Ia Piimaiwaa i pii ai, ua ike ko lalo poe, i ka pii ana a komo malalo o ka hulili, a me kona holo ana mai me ka mama loa, mai laila mai. Aka, ua manao na mea a pau loa o lalo, ua make o Piimaiwaa, no ke komo ana i kahi haiki pilikia loa; aka, i ko lakou ike ana ia Piimaiwaa e holo mai ana, ua uwa lakou me ka olioli, no ke koa loa o Piimaiwaa, no ka mea, oia wale no ke koa i hele a komo i laila, aia hoi ma ia hulili elua mano kanaka ka nui, ua like me ewalu tausani ka nui. Ma keia hana ana a Piimaiwaa, ua oluolu loa ka manao o ke ’lii o Umi, a me na kanaka a pau loa o Hawaii.","When he arrived in the presence of Umi he was asked: “What about your climb?” Piimaiwaa replied: “Well, I went up as far as the ladder and there I encountered the men of Ohiaokealakona.” By this reply of Piimaiwaa, several men substantiated the statement, for the people from below saw him enter the pass leading to the foot of the ladder, and again when he came back running with great speed. But the people below all thought, when Piimaiwaa entered the pass, that he would be killed, for the place was very narrow and hard to go through; but when they saw Piimaiwaa return running they shouted with joy, for they realized the difficulties of the way and admired his fearlessness, and also because he was the only man who ever accomplished the feat of going as far as he did, for at this place there was stationed, at this time, about eight thousand men. In the performance of this difficult feat the king and the men from Hawaii were greatly pleased."
"I ka po ana iho, a poeleele, pii hou o Piimaiwaa e hakilo i ke kanaka nui, e olelo ia ana, me ko Piimaiwaa manao koa loa, e kaua no laua ina he kanaka. A hiki o Piimaiwaa i kahi a Omaokamau laua o Koi i ku mua ai, nana aku la ia, he kanaka nui io no e ku mai ana, kiekie no a kiekie, nui no a nui, loihi no a loihi ka laau palau.

When he reached the place where Omaokamau and Koi had stood he looked up and sure enough there was the large man, very tall, very large, and his club was the longest he had ever seen. When Piimaiwaa saw the man he began to study out a course of action for him to follow, and finally he decided to do this: that he would challenge the man to battle by the twirling of his war club, Wahie. This way of challenging was usually used, and the acceptance of the challenge was shown by the opponent by a return twirling of the war club. Piimaiwaa reasoned that in case the man should see him and strike at him he would be far enough away not to be touched by the club. Piimaiwaa then stepped up the ladder with firm feet, twirling his club all the while. After twirling his club on his right for some time he changed and twirled it on the left. After twirling the club on the left for some time, he looked at the man for some time studying what the man was going to do. Failing in seeing the man make any motion, he repeated the sign of the challenge, and still the man failed to make any motion. Piimaiwaa therefore concluded that the man knew nothing of [ ] the use of the war club, and that he was just holding it to strike at Piimaiwaa when he got near enough, and that the man was not taught to ward off the blow with the use of the club. When he saw this he said to himself: “If that is the case I shall kill you immediately.”"
"Alaila, hele aku la o Piimaiwaa me ka makau ole, a hiki i ka hua o ka laau palau a ua kii nei, mai laila aku a waenakonu a hiki loa i ke ku ana o ua kii nei. Alaila, ku iho la ia i laila, a hooponopono aku la i kana laau palau e hou i ke kii, ma keia hou ana, ua loaa ua kii nei, a koele ana ka laau palau. Pela no kana hana ana a kokoke i kahi e ku ana, ike pono iho la ia he kii keia, aohe kanaka, alaila, pau kona makau a me ka pihoihoi. Lalau iho la ia i ua kii nei, a kulai aku la a hina i lalo, olokaa aku la i ka pali, a haule i lalo o ka pali o Kapueokahi. A kahea aku la o Piimaiwaa i ka poe o lalo: “E lalo e, eia mai ke kii a kakou e kuhi nei he kanaka. Aohe kaua o luna nei, ua pau i ka hiamoe, ua hee ka puu o Kauiki.”","Piimaiwaa then advanced without fear until he reached the end of the man’s club. From this point he advanced further until he reached the middle of the club, then on until he reached the very man. Piimaiwaa then stood and prepared his club to poke at the man. He then tapped the man, a sign to give the man warning; when he did he heard a sound as of wood. He then approached the man and saw that it was only an image, and not a real man. This ended his excitement and fear. He then took the wooden image and threw it down, and rolled it over the cliff of Kapueokahi. Piimaiwaa then called to those below: “Say, you people there down below, here is the image that we have all this time taken for a real man. There is no fighting up here; the men are all asleep; the hill is captured.”"
"A lohe o Omaokamau a me Koi, i ko Piimaiwaa leo e hea ana mai luna mai o ka puu o Kauiki, pii aku la laua a hiki i luna. Mamua ae o ko laua hiki ana i luna o ka puu o Kauiki, e luku ana o Piimaiwaa i na kanaka a me na ’lii o luna; a hiki laua, hookahi na luku pu ana i na kanaka. Ma keia kaua ana, ua make, a ua hee ka puu o luna o Kauiki ia lakou, a ua make hoi ke ’lii o Maui, oia o Kalaninuikupuapaikalaninui. Ia wa, lilo ae la ka puu o Kauiki ia Umi. A make ke ’lii nui o Maui, koe iho la o Imaikalani, he ’lii no, he koa nae i makau ia e Umi, no kona akamai loa. [ ]","When Omaokamau and Koi heard the voice of Piimaiwaa calling from the top of the hill, they came and followed him up. Before they arrived on the top of the hill, however, Piimaiwaa had already begun the slaughter of the people and chiefs, and they joined therein. The king of Maui was already dead, and this fact gave Umi the control of the hill of Kauiki. This ended the battle, and Umi became possessed of the island of Maui, which he turned over to Kihapiilani and returned with Piikea his wife, and all his men, to Hawaii. [ ]"
"He alii nui o Lonoikamakahiki no ka mokupuni o Hawaii mahope iho o ko Keawenuiaumi make ana; he kanaonokumamaha hanauna mai a Wakea mai.

Keawenuiaumi was his father and Kaihalawai was his mother. Lonoikamakahiki was born at Napoopoo, and it was at this place that he was brought up by his retainers until he was full grown. His retainers were Hauna and Loli, and Kohenemonemo the wife of the two men."
"I ko Lonoikamakahiki wa opiopio, oiai ua hoomaka ae kona noonoo ana, ia manawa nana ae la o Lonoikamakahiki, e kau ana na mea lealea a kona makuakane he nui maloko o ka hale alii; a ike ae la oia e kau ana na ihe-pahee, nana loihi ae la oia, a liuliu, alaila, ninau aku la oia i kona mau kahu: “Heaha keia mau mea loloa e kau nei iluna o ka hale?” I aku la na kahu: “He ihe-pahee.” Ninau hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha kana waiwai?” Alaila hai aku la na kahu: “Elua mau kanaka e manao ana e lealea pili waiwai, alaila hele laua a ma ke kahua pahee; a i ka hiki ana malaila, alaila, olelo ka pili a holo, ina he mau waiwai ka pili, a i ole, he mau aina paha; a ina aole i pili ia ma ia mau waiwai, alaila, o ka pili no i na iwi ka pili, alaila pahee, ina he umikumamalima ka ai (ka helu).

If they do not wager these things, then they would put up other things, such as their bones, meaning their lives. After the bets are agreed on, they would then proceed to play the game of pahee. If the points to be scored in order to win the game be made fifteen, then the one who first obtains this number of points would win and the one with the lesser points would lose; then the winner takes the articles wagered, or whatever had been placed as wagers. Sometimes the articles of value would be so great that it would take three and four houses to hold them all. But if the things wagered be their bones, then death of course would be meted out to the loser. Wagering for bones was not made very often, only when the parties entered into the merits of their skill by long and spirited arguments, each claiming to be superior to the other. That is the use of those long things you see.”"
"A lohe o Lonoikamakahiki i keia mea, olelo ae la oia: “Aole ana waiwai; aka, he waiwai no, hookahi no hewa, o ka pili ana i na iwi ke hiki mai i ka manawa e hoopaapaa ai na mea pahee i ko laua mau ike, nolaila ka waiwai ole oia mea.” I aku la na kahu: “Oia iho la no ka waiwai oia mea (pahee) i malamaia ai e kou makuakane.” [ ]","When Lonoikamakahiki heard this explanation he replied: “Those things are worthless and have very little use; the great objection I have against them is that they are used by men for the purpose of making wagers, even to the extent of their bones, on the result of their skill after heated arguments. That is the reason they are [ ] worthless.” The retainers then said: “That is what the pahee spears are used for and the reason why they are being kept by your father.”"
"Ia manawa, nana hou ae la oia, a iki i ka olohu (ulu maika) ninau hou ae la oia: “Heaha kela mea?” Hai aku la no na kahu: “He olohu.” Ninau aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha hoi ka waiwai oia mea?” Alaila hai aku la no na kahu e like me ka olelo ana no ka ihe pahee. I hou aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “E kiola, aole ana waiwai.”","Lonoikamakahiki again looked up and saw a round, flat stone and again asked: “What is that thing?” The retainers replied: “It is called an olohu.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked: “What is it used for?” Then the retainers told him that it was used in the same way and for the same purpose as the pahee spears. At this Lonoikamakahiki replied: “Throw it away; it is also worthless.”"
"Nana hou ae la no ua o Lonoikamakahiki, a ike i ka pua kea, ninau hou aku la no i na kahu: “Heaha hoi kela?” Hai aku la na kahu: “He pua kea.” Ninau hou aku no ua o Lonoikamakahiki: “A pehea hoi kana hana?” Hai aku la no na kahu: “He mea lealea no ia; ina elua a ekolu paha mau mea e kea pua ana, a ina i lele ka kekahi a oi loa mamua o ka kekahi mau mea alaila, o ka eo ae la no ia.

If two or three fellows wish to play the game with the arrows they go to the playground and see who could glide his arrow on the ground the farthest. The one who can send it the farthest wins. If articles of value have been placed as wagers the winner takes them. It is used in the same way and for the same purpose as the pahee spears, and large wagers have been lost and won on the game.” Lonoikamakahiki then replied: “It, too, is worthless; you had better break it up and throw it away.”"
"Nana hou ae la no ua o Lonoikamakahiki, a ike ae la i ka laau palau, ninau ae la: “ Heaha hoi kela?” I aku na kahu: “He laau palau?” Ninau hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha kana hana?” Hai aku la na kahu: “He mea pepehi aku i na kanaka, ina paha he hoouka kaua mai ko kekahi aoao, a hoouka aku ko kekahi aoao, alaila o ka laau palau ka mea e luku aku ai.

If a battle is being fought with one side opposing the other then the war club comes in use as an implement of war. When this club is used in war it can kill as many as forty people, and sometimes it will kill more people than that.” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “That thing is also without value. Its only use would be for a stick to turn over the stones in an umu.”"
"Nana hou ae la no ua o Lonoikamakahiki, a o ke kau a ke kaula maa, ninau ae la: “Heaha ka waiwai o kela mau kaula e lewalewa mai nei?” Hai aku la na kahu: “He maa.” Ninau hou aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha hoi kona waiwai?” Hai aku la na kahu: “E hookomo i ka pohaku ma ka puka o ka maa, alaila, e pelu mai ina piko elua o ua maa la, a e hoopaa ae i ka piko o na kaula o ua maa la i ka poho o ka lima e makaukau [ ] ana i ka hana; alaila, e wili ae, a kowali ae, a e like me kona manawa i manao ai e hoolele aku i ka pohaku, alaila, e haalele loa aku i kekahi piko o ka maa, alaila e lele aku ka pohaku, he kanaha a oi aku na anana e lele ai, a ina i pa aku i ka pohaku, make loa kekahi kanaka.

Sometimes the stone would fly over forty fathoms, and if a person is struck with it the force would kill the person. It is, however, used as an implement of war.” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “That makes two things of value belonging to my father. Tie it up with the bundle of spears.” Lonoikamakahiki in this manner inquired into the use of all the things kept by his father. He denied the usefulness of everything but two, which two things he had the greatest desire to reserve for his own use."
"I kekahi manawa ae, hele aku la no o Lonoikamakahiki a ka hale i waiho ai na mea lealea, nana ae la, e kau ana no na mea ana i olelo ai i na kahu, e haihai a kiola; nolaila, hoi aku la oia a kona mau kahu, olelo aku la: “Kai noa, ua kiola olua i na mea a’u i olelo aku ai ia olua?” I aku la kona mau kahu: “Aole e hiki ia maua ke kiola i na mea a ko makuakane; make mai paha maua, no ka mea, o ka laau palau a ko makuakane, he laau hai kanaka ia.” A no ka paakiki loa o Lonoikamakahiki, nolaila, hele aku la na kahu, a hai aku la ia Keawenuiaumi, i keia mau hana a kana keiki.","Sometime after this, Lonoikamakahiki again visited the house where the different implements of war and games were kept, and again looked and saw the things he had ordered to be broken and destroyed still hanging in their respective places, so he returned and asked of his retainers: “I thought you two had destroyed those things that I told you to.” His two retainers answered him saying: “We cannot destroy the things belonging to your father, for he would consider it a matter sufficient to cause our death, because the war club is one of the things highly valued by your father, for it has been used in his great battles, and it has been the means of killing many of his enemies.” Lonoikamakahiki becoming very stubborn in the matter, the retainers therefore went to Keawenuiaumi and reported to him the wish of his son."
"Ia manawa, lohe ae la o Keawenuiaumi, alaila, haohao iho la oia i keia hana kupanaha a kana keiki; nolaila, hele aku la oia e ninau maopopo ia Lonoikamakahiki i ke kumu o ko ke keiki manao ana pela. Nolaila i ka hiki ana aku o Keawenuiaumi i kahi i hanai ia ai e na kahu, aia nae ua o Lonoikamakahiki i ka hooholowaa me kekahi mau kahu ona. A hoi mai la ua o Lonoikamakahiki, e noho aku ana o Keawenuiaumi, hele mai la ke keiki a noho iho la i luna o na uha o ka makuakane; alaila, i mea e maopopo ai ia Keawenuiaumi ko Lonoikamakahiki manao, nolaila, lawe ae la kona makuakane iaia i kahi i waiho ai na mea lealea. A hiki aku la laua, me na kahu pu ma ka hale i waiho ai na mea lealea, ninau aku la o Keawenuiaumi: “Heaha kou manao no neia mau mea (na mea lealea ame na mea kaua) e kau nei?” I ae la ke keiki (Lonoikamakahiki): “Aole he waiwai iki o keia mau mea, ua olelo aku wau ia laua ’la (Hauna ame Loli) e kiola keia mau mea a pau, a o ka ihe kaua ame ka maa na mea waiwai.” I aku la o Keawenuiaumi: “Aole pela ko’u manao, aia no a hiki i kou noho aimoku ana, alaila, nau no e kiola, ke ike aku la oe, he mea waiwai ole kela.”","When Keawenuiaumi heard this report he was greatly surprised because of the strange wish expressed by his son. He therefore sought out Lonoikamakahiki with the intention of asking him why he wished to have these things destroyed. When Keawenuiaumi came to the place where the boy was being cared for by the retainers, he found that Lonoikamakahiki was out canoe sailing with some of his other retainers. When Lonoikamakahiki returned Keawenuiaumi was waiting for him; the boy then went up to the father and sat on his lap. In order to have the matter understood by his son properly Keawenuiaumi took Lonoikamakahiki to the house where the different implements of war and games were kept, and there the father asked the son: “What do you think of these things?” meaning the implements of war and games hanging on the wall. The son replied: “These things are of no value or use. I have told those two (Hauna and Loli) to destroy them all, but to keep the bundle of spears and the sling, for they are of value.” Keawenuiaumi then said to the boy: “That is not what I think about those things. When the time comes for you to assume the care of the whole island, then you will be in a position to do as you like; you can then throw these things away if you see no use in retaining them.”"
"Ma ia hope mai, nalu wale iho la no o Keawenuiaumi i ka hope o keia keiki ke nui ae. I iho a ka makuakane: “Ane kipi wale aku no koe o keia keiki ma kona noho ai aina ana, a heaha la ka hana a keia alii ke kanaka makua aku.” [ ]","After this incident Keawenuiaumi for some time thought over the future of the boy and wondered what would become of him after he had grown up. The father said [ ] to himself: “It looks as though the boy will some day go contrary to all the laws that have heretofore governed the apportioning of lands, and I wonder what this chief will do after he has grown up.”"
"I kekahi manawa ma ia hope mai, komo ae la ua o Lonoikamakahiki i loko o ka heiau me kona mau kahu, a ike aku la i na kii e ku mai ana ma kuono o ka heiau, ninau aku la i na kahu: “Owai kela mau kanaka e ku mai la i loko o ka pa?” I aku la na makua a me na kahu: “Aole ia he kanaka, he akua ia o ko makou mau makua, na kupuna hoi ou.” A lohe o Lonoikamakahiki he akua ia mau kii, alaila puliki ikaika aku la i na makua, no ka mea, ua makau o Lonoikamakahiki, a no ka mea hoi, ua lohe mua oia i ka hoomakaukauia e na hoa paani ona, a nolaila oia i puliki paa ai i na makua, no kona manao o pau mai i ke akua, no ka mea, ua oleloia e kona mau hoa kamalii: “E lono-e!

Oia ka waiwai o ke akua i malama ia ai.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki ia Keawenuiaumi: “Akolu wale no au mea waiwai i malama ai; o keia mau mea au ka’u e malama.”","Sometime after this Lonoikamakahiki entered the temple with his retainers and there saw the images standing up in one of the corners, when he asked of his retainers: “Who are those persons standing there within the wall?” His parents and retainers replied: “They are not persons; they are the gods of our parents, your grandparents.” When Lonoikamakahiki heard that the images were gods he was sore afraid and held on to his parents with all his strength, for he had been told by his playmates that ghosts were things to be avoided and feared, and he thought the images were the ghosts. Because Lonoikamakahiki held on to his parents they said to him: “You must not be afraid; what you see are not ghosts; they are the gods who own this place.” Lonoikamakahiki then asked of his parents: “What are they good for?” The parents made reply: “The reason why they are kept is this: If in case of battle one is taken captive or defeated, they offer a prayer to the gods, and then the gods will direct the person to safety. If, on the other hand, a canoe is capsized out in mid-ocean, prayers are offered to the gods and those in the canoe will be saved. If a season of famine should come, prayers are offered to the gods and the food would again appear out of the earth. These are some of the benefits why a god should be kept.” Lonoikamakahiki then said to his father, Keawenuiaumi: “That makes three things in your keeping that are of value. I will take care of these things.”"

Aka, ma ka mokomoko, oia ka oihana i oi aku ko Lonoikamakahiki ike ame ke akamai maoli.","Sometime after Lonoikamakahiki had outgrown his childhood days and had almost attained manhood, he began to learn the art of dodging and throwing the spear; he also learned how to box and wrestle. These things were in time mastered by him. When he became proficient in these arts of defense and of war, the teachers who had charge of his training in these matters then held the last customary ceremonies, as a sign of foretelling how he would act in life. The signs were favorable in all the different arts with one exception, that of boxing, which, not being favorable in this one thing, he was advised to eliminate this one art from the list of those he was to participate in. In other words, he was forbidden from ever going into any boxing contest. Because of this Lonoikamakahiki relinquished his claims as a boxer. It was in the art of wrestling, however, that Lonoikamakahiki proved himself to be the most proficient."
"I ko Lonoikamakahiki wa i hoonaauao loa ae ai, makemake ae la oia e ike maopopo i na hana oi o ka waiwai, a nolaila, hoao pakahi aku la oia i na hana lealea, ame na hana kaua a kona makuakane, na hana hoi ana i olelo ai i kona mau kahu, he mau hana waiwai ole. [ ]","When Lonoikamakahiki became older and more matured in thought he expressed a desire to know the things that would be of the most use to him, especially in the games, so he tried each one of them, as well as the different arts of warfare indulged in by his father, the things that were told him by his retainers as the things most desired. [ ]"
"A i ko Lonoikamakahiki hoao ana, maopopo iho la no he waiwai ole ia mau mea, a e like hoi me kana olelo mua, o ka alo ihe ame ka oo ihe, ka maa ame ka malama i ke akua na hana waiwai.

The thrust and dodging spear, the sling, and the care of the god, however, were of value. He therefore made a visit around the island of Hawaii accompanied by his parents and retainers."
"O Hauna nae ame kona kaikaina me Loli, na kahu hoi o ua o Lonoikamakahiki, he mau kaula laua, he mau kanaka haipule hoi, a ua oleloia he mau kanaka mana laua, a he hiki ia laua ke hana i na hana mana he nui ma ka inoa o ko Keawenuiaumi akua, ame ko laua akua hoi.","Hauna and his younger brother Loli, the personal attendants or retainers of Lonoikamakahiki, were prophets; they were men who paid attention strictly to the laws of the gods, and it was said that they were men who possessed supernatural powers, and that they were able to perform many miracles in the name of the god of Keawenuiaumi, and also in the name of their own god."
"Ma keia kaapuni ana o Lonoikamakahiki me kona mau makua, a hiki ma Hilo, a noho iho la ma Kanokapa, kahi e pili pu ana me ka nuku o ka muliwai o Wailuku. E noho ana o Kawaamaukele malaila, he kahuna kakaolelo nui, ua elemakule oia, a poohina no hoi.

He was a very old man, his head was wholly gray."
"A ike aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i ua elemakule nei, oiai e noho pu ana oia me kona mau kahu. Ninau malu aku la: “He akua anei kela elemakule lauoho loloa?” I aku la na kahu: “Aole he akua, he kanaka no, he kakaolelo nae, he kahuna nui oia ma na oihana kahuna apau.” Ninau hou aku la ua o Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha ka waiwai a ia elemakule?” I aku na kahu: “O ke kanaka ike i ke kakaolelo, he kanaka nui ia imua o ke alo alii; he kanaka akamai i ka olelo, ma kana olelo e olelo ai, malaila ke alii e hoolohe ai; nana e ike ka pomaikai o ka aina ame ke kanaka, he hiki i kela kanaka ke iki mai i ke kanaka waiwai ame ka waiwai ole, ke alii waiwai ame ka waiwai ole.”","When Lonoikamakahiki saw the old man he was greatly surprised, because this man was the only man that differed from the rest of the men that came in the presence of Keawenuiaumi; his hair was so long that it reached below his waist, a thing common with the high priests, however. When Lonoikamakahiki, who was sitting with his attendants, had looked at the old man for some time he asked: “Is that old man with the long hair a god?” The attendants replied: “He is not a god; he is a human being, but not of the ordinary kind; he is a counselor. He is also the high priest, higher than all the others.” Again Lonoikamakahiki asked: “What is the old man good for?” The attendants replied: “The man who is a counselor is a very great man in the court of the king; he must be a man who is skilful in language, and whatever advice he gives the king, the king will take heed. He can predict the coming of prosperity to the land and the people. That man can tell whether a common person will become rich or poor, or the chief who will become wealthy or not.”"
"A no keia mea hoouna aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i kekahi kahu ona e kii i ke kakaolelo ia Kawaamaukele. A hiki mai la i mua o Keawenuiaumi me Lonoikamakahiki, i aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “I kiiia aku nei oe no ko’u lohe ana he elemakule akamai oe i ka ike mai i ke alii waiwai ame ka waiwai ole; nolaila, e nana mai oe ia’u, malia paha he alii ilihune wau ma keia manawa aku, a e hai mai oe i ka’u mau hana [ ] ma keia hope aku.” I mai o Kawaamaukele: “He alii waiwai no oe i kekahi manawa, aia a hike aku i kou wa kanaka makua, alaila, ilihune oe aole ou kanaka, aka, he alii koa oe.” I hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “I aha ka’u hana e hana ai i waiwai ai?

When he came in the presence of Keawenuiaumi and Lonoikamakahiki, Lonoikamakahiki spoke up saying: “You have been requested to come here because I have been told that you are an old man who is learned in the things of the future and can tell whether a chief will become rich or poor; therefore I want you to make an examination of me and tell me what I am to be in the future.” [ ] Kawaamaukele then replied: “You are going to be a wealthy chief at times, but when you reach maturity then you will become poor, in that you will be without followers; but you are going to be a brave chief.” Lonoikamakahiki then again asked him: “What profession shall I take up in order that I may become wealthy? If you know what I can take up that will be profitable as a profession, then we will take it up and you instruct me in its detail.” The priest paused for a while, thinking of what Lonoikamakahiki had asked, and then replied: “The professions that will make you famous all over the islands are that of a counselor and hoopapa. If you can be an expert in this profession of hoopapa, then you will become wealthy.” Lonoikamakahiki took to heart every word spoken by the high priest."
"Mahope iho oia manawa, ao ae la oia i ka oihana hoopapa ma ka aoao kakaolelo, a naauao oia ma ia hana, a oia ka oihana i kaulana nui ai o Lonoikamakahiki a puni na moku, o ke kolu no hoi ia o ka Lonoikamakahiki mau hana akamai a hiki i kona make ana; a nui loa ka pilikia o kekahi poe alii iaia.","Sometime after this the profession of hoopapa was taken up by Lonoikamakahiki and he was educated into the different things of the profession pertaining to that portion relating to language, and after he had mastered it he in later years did become famous all over the islands. This made the third thing that Lonoikamakahiki became proficient in up to the time of his death, and he caused no end of trouble for certain chiefs."
"Mahope mai o kona ao ana i ka oihana hoopapa ma Hilo, hoi aku la oia me kona mau makua a noho ma Napoopoo, a hoomaka aku la oia i ka hoopapa me na hoa paani ona, a lilo iho la ka hana hoopapa i mea makemake nui na Lonoikamakahiki a pau ka la, a pela aku. Aka, o Lonoikamakahiki, ua hoolawehala wale aku oia i kona mau hoa paani, i mea e hoopapa ai, he mea e hoao ai i kana oihana hoopapa. O na puulu kamalii a pau o Kealakekua, ua hoopapa mau ia e Lonoikamakahiki, aka nae, aole i ike o Lonoikamakahiki i kona akamai ma ia hana hope ana i ao ai, aka, o ka mea nana i ao aku, ua ike aku oia i ke akamai ma ka hoopapa ana.","After completing the study of hoopapa in Hilo he returned with his parents to Napoopoo, where they took up their residence and he immediately practiced his profession on his playmates, and in this manner he made practical use of it. In this way the profession of hoopapa became a favorite thing with him, making use of it day after day. After a time, however, Lonoikamakahiki began to ensnare his playmates by getting into argument with them in order to test his profession of wrangling. All the crowds of children in Kealakekua were taken up by Lonoikamakahiki and defeated. In thus making practical tests of his vocation Lonoikamakahiki, although making great headway, was at the same time unaware of his advance in his profession; but the person who had charge of his education was well aware of his skill in argument."
"Ma ko Lonoikamakahiki mau la hookanaka makua, lawe ae la oia i kona kaikuahine ia Kaikilani i wahine nana.

Ia ike ana o Kanaloakuaana me Kaikilani, loaa o Kalanioumi ame Kealiiokalani, he mau kaikamahine laua, a o Keakealani, ke keikikane.","When Lonoikamakahiki grew to the age of maturity he took unto himself his cousin Kaikilani to be his wife. During the early part of their married life they lived in peace and happiness, and nothing occurred between them to cause any dissatisfaction. During all the time that they lived as man and wife they did not have issue; but Kaikilani had three children with Kanaloakuaana, an uncle of Kaikilani’s. When Kanaloakuaana took Kaikilani to be his wife their issue was Kalanioumi and Kealiiokalani, who were girls, and Keakealani, a boy."
"Mamua o ko Keawenuiaumi make ana, kauoha ae la oia ia Lonoikamakahiki e noho ma ka noho alii, aka, aole pela ko Lonoikamakahiki manao.

[ ]","Before Keawenuiaumi died he requested Lonoikamakahiki to take the head of the government, but Lonoikamakahiki did not think it proper to do so. What Lonoikamakahiki told his father was, that he did not wish to take charge of the affairs of state at that time, but to defer the time until he was able to master the arts of warfare, when he could become expert therein; then he would take charge. Because of this, Keawenuiaumi left the whole island of Hawaii in the care of Kaikilani. After the death of Keawenuiaumi, Kaikilani took charge of the government. She was the first chiefess who became the ruler of the land. [ ]"
"Ma ia hope mai o ko Kaikilani ai moku ana, kaapuni ae la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Hawaii a puni, e hoiki ana i kona ike ma na mea ana i ao ai o ka oihana kaua, a lanakila ae ia oia ma ia mau hana.

Alaila hoao hou aku la o Lonoikamakahiki no na ihe elua i ka manawa hookahi, a ua akamai no oia i ka alo ana no ia mau ihe.","After Kaikilani had assumed the care of the government, Lonoikamakahiki made a circuit of the island of Hawaii making public competitions in all the different arts of warfare mastered by him, in which he was always victorious. Word of these accomplishments of Lonoikamakahiki was in time carried to the hearing of Kanaloakuaana. When Lonoikamakahiki arrived home after making this circuit, he competed in boxing against Kanaloakuaana, for he, too, was skilful in all the arts of warfare. Kanaloakuaana did not demand this competition for any other purpose than to test for himself how proficient Lonoikamakahiki was, therefore they tried at boxing and Kanaloakuaana found that he was skilful. Kanaloakuaana then took up spear throwing as the next thing. At this Lonoikamakahiki said: “I have not studied the art of spear throwing; but what I have mastered is the art of dodging the spear.” Kanaloakuaana therefore took him at his word and did the throwing while Lonoikamakahiki did the dodging. In this trial Kanaloakuaana was satisfied that Lonoikamakahiki was indeed master of this art. The dodging of two spears at once was next taken up and again he proved himself to be proficient."
"A ike aku la o Kanaloakuaana ua akamai o Lonoikamakahiki, alaila, hoao ae la no laua no na ihe eha e hou i ka manawa hookahi, aka, he mea ole ia ia Lonoikamakahiki; a pela no ka laua hoao ana a hiki i na ihe he umi.

This trial was continued until they reached ten spears. When this number of spears was reached Kanaloakuaana was certain that Lonoikamakahiki was master of more than ten spears, so he concluded to make further trials, the dodging of any number of spears at once."
"A i mea e maopopo ai ia Kanaloakuaana ke akamai o Lonoikamakahiki ma ka oo ihe, lawe ae la oia ia Lonoikamakahiki ma Kailua, ma ke one o Kaiakekua. A hiki aku la malaila, ia manawa, olelo aku la o Kanaloakuaana ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua makemake au e ike i ko akamai loa, nolaila wau i lawe mai nei maanei e ike i kou akamai, no ka mea, ua hoao kaua i ka oo ihe ma ka ihe hookahi a hiki i ka umi, ua ike au i kou akamai ma ia mau ihe, aka, hookahi mea i koe ia oe, o ka alo ana iloko o ke olowalu ihe, ina e akamai oe ma ia mau mea, alaila akamai io oe.”","In order to make this further trial Kanaloakuaana took Lonoikamakahiki to Kailua, to the sandy beach at Kaiakekua. When they came to the place, Kanaloakuaana said to Lonoikamakahiki: “I want to be positive of your great skill, hence I have brought you here for that test and to satisfy myself that you are indeed a master. We have tested you from one to ten spears, and I am sure you are skilful in the dodging of that number. There is, however, one more trial—the dodging of any number of spears. If you are proficient in this, then you are indeed expert.”"
"A pau ka Kanaloakuaana olelo ana no keia mea, alaila ku mai la ka poe oo ihe ma ke alo mai a ma na aoao, koe kona kua, ua like paha me kanakolu ihe e hou i ka manawa hookahi. Aka ia hoao ana, aole i ku iki o Lonoikamakahiki ia mau ihe.

Pela no ka Kanaloakuaana hoao ana a pau na mea a Lonoikamakahiki i ao ai.","After Kanaloakuaana had spoken the above words, the people who were to throw the spears arose in front and on both sides of Lonoikamakahiki, leaving his back free. There were about thirty spearmen to throw at the same time. After the men were ready and the spears thrown it was seen that Lonoikamakahiki was not hit by a single one of them. Kanaloakuaana continued the test from thirty spears until the number had reached two times forty spears; still Lonoikamakahiki was not hit. The only time that Lonoikamakahiki was pricked was by himself with his own spear. The trials in the different arts were carried out in the most severe way until all the different arts were gone through."
"Mahope iho o ko Kanaloakuaana hoao ana ia Lonoikamakahiki, nolaila olelo aku la o Kanaloakuaana ia Kaikilani: “E hoihoi ka aina ia Lonoikamakahiki.” No ka mea ua maopopo ia Kanaloakuaana ke akamai ma na mea e pili ana i ke Aupuni.

Noho iho la o Lonoikamakahiki me kana wahine ma na aina apau o Hawaii, he mau poo no ke aupuni.","After Kanaloakuaana had put Lonoikamakahiki through all the different trials of skill in the various arts of warfare, Kanaloakuaana said to Kaikilani: “The care of the government must be given over to Lonoikamakahiki.” This was because Kanaloakuaana [ ] was satisfied that Lonoikamakahiki was well able to take charge of all things pertaining to the government. Because of this, Kanaloakuaana told Lonoikamakahiki to fill the vacancy left by Keawenuiaumi, so Lonoikamakahiki assumed control of the government. It was Lonoikamakahiki together with his wife, however, that took charge of all the lands of Hawaii, and the two were the head of the government."
"A liuliu ko Lonoikamakahiki noho alii ana, aole he kaua a kipi hoi ma ia hope mai, aole no hoi i kulanalana kona noho ana me kana wahine. Aka, o Kaikilani, oia o laua mea i hana i ka hewa, no ka mea, ua lawe ae oia ia Heakekoa ke keiki a Kalaulipali me Uli i kane moe kolohe nana, me ka ike ole o Lonoikamakahiki.","After Lonoikamakahiki had ruled for some time no dissatisfaction over his administration of the affairs of the government was shown; no wars in the nature of rebellions arose, and this peaceful reign lasted for some considerable time; neither was any family trouble seen. But Kaikilani, on the other hand, was the one who fell into sin, for she took Heakekoa, the son of Kalaulipali and Uli, as her paramour without the knowledge of Lonoikamakahiki."
"A i ka manawa i manao ai o Lonoikamakahiki e holo makaikai ia Maui a hiki i Kauai; nolaila, lawe ae la oia i kana wahine ia Kaikilani, e hele pu ma ia huakai hele a ke alii. A i ka manawa i makaukau ai o ka huakai a ke alii, lawe ae la oia i kona mau hoewaa, ame kona kahu me Loli.

Aia nae maloko o ua hokeo la na mea hoopapa a pau, na ukana o kela ano keia ano. A lawe ae la no hoi i kana kahili o Eleeleualani, he kahili nui ia.","After a time Lonoikamakahiki formed a desire to visit Maui and to go as far as Kauai; so he took his wife Kaikilani to accompany him on this trip. When everything pertaining to the king’s journey was ready he took his canoe men and his attendant, Loli. The chief desire that actuated Lonoikamakahiki to make this journey was that he might show his skill in his favorite profession of hoopapa. Because of this fact he took with him his calabash of clothes known by the name of Kuwalawala. In this calabash, besides his apparel, were several of the things which were used by him in the profession of hoopapa. Besides this calabash he took along with him his feather kahili, Eleeleualani. This was a very large kahili."
"A makaukau ka huakai a ke alii, alaila, holo aku la lakou a Maui, aole i liuliu ma Maui, alaila holo aku la ma Molokai, a ma Koolau ka lakou holo ana, a noho ma Kalaupapa. Ia kau ana o lakou nei malaila, aole i manao o Lonoikamakahiki e liuliu ka noho ana malaila, aka no ka loohia ana o lakou e ka makani ino, nolaila, liuliu ai lakou malaila, he mau malama paha eha. Ia manawa no a laua i noho ai ma Kalaupapa, he konane ka laua hana nui ia mau malama.","After everything was made ready the king and his companions set out and went as far as Maui. They did not make a very lengthy stay in Maui and the king’s visit was continued to Molokai. The journey was taken to the Koolau side of the island and a stop was made at Kalaupapa. In making the stop at this place Lonoikamakahiki did not contemplate that they would remain very long, but because of the coming of a very severe storm they were detained at this place for about four months. While the royal party was sojourning at Kalaupapa the two whiled away most of their time playing the game of konane."
"I kela manawa hoi a ua o Lonoikamakahiki ma i haalele aku ai a holo mai ai i ka makaikai, ia manawa he mea nui loa ia no ko Heakekoa aloha no Kaikilani, a hiki ole ke hoomanawanui; nolaila, huli mai la o ua o Heakekoa mahope o Lonoikamakahiki ma.

Noho iho la o Heakekoa ma Kalae no kekahi mau la, me ke ake e loaa ka mea nana e lawe aku ka lohe ia Kaikilani, aka, aole he kanaka kupono.","At the time when Lonoikamakahiki and his party left on their journey of sightseeing, Heakekoa missed his lover Kaikilani so much that he was unable to remain in Hawaii; therefore he followed Lonoikamakahiki and his party. In following them up Heakekoa first called at Maui, and, failing to find them, he continued on to Molokai and landed at Kalae, where he was informed that the royal couple were staying at Kalaupapa. Heakekoa remained at Kalae for several days with the hope of securing someone who would carry the news of his arrival to Kaikilani, but he was unable to secure a proper person."
"I kekahi la, hiki mai la kekahi mau kanaka no Kalaupapa mai; a i ka wa i hoi ai kela poe ma Kalaupapa, nolaila ninau aku la ua o Heakekoa i na kanaka me ka i aku: “E hoi ana anei oukou i Kalaupapa?” Ae, mai la na kanaka.

When the time came for the men to make their return to Kalaupapa, Heakekoa inquired of them: “Are you people going back to Kalaupapa?” The men assented. Again Heakekoa asked: “Are not the chiefs of Hawaii staying there?” The men then told him positively, saying: “They are still there.” Heakekoa then said: “When you get to the [ ] edge of the cliff, on your return, just call out the following words: ‘Say, Kaikilani, Chiefess of Puna, love has been sent you by the shady cliff, of Uli of Hea.’ If she does not make answer, then call out again these words:"
"‘E Kaikilani alii wahine o Puna-e, E aa mai ana ko ipo ia oe, O ke ku a ka lauli pali o Uli o Heakekoa.’","‘Say, Kaikilani, Chiefess of Puna, Your lover sends you his love Of the shady cliff that stands, of Uli of Heakekoa.’"
"A lohe ae la lakou i keia olelo a Heakekoa, alaila, hoi aku la ua mau kanaka nei.

When the men came to the top of the Kalaupapa cliff, at a point called Kaomilani, they called out in the words instructed them by Heakekoa. At the first call Kaikilani heard it coming down from the cliff, and she then knew that her lover had arrived. At this time, however, when the call was heard by Kaikilani, she was engaged in a game of konane with her husband, but in order to distract the attention of her husband as to the meaning of the call from the cliff she made some informal remark, yet in connection with the game of konane, saying: “That is won; this is on the run, the space is long, the top is falling, the blacks are indistinct; the whites have won.”"
"A no ka manao o na kanaka nana i kahea aku aole i lohe o Kaikilani, nolaila, kahea hou aku la ua poe kanaka nei:","After making the calls and believing that they had not been heard by Kaikilani, the men repeated the call, saying:"
"Ia manawa, lohe ae la o Lonoikamakahiki, he kane o Heakekoa na Kaikilani, me ka manao no ua pae mai ma kekahi wahi o Molokai.","For once Lonoikamakahiki knew that Heakekoa was the lover of Kaikilani, and from the calls he also knew that the fellow had landed at some place on Molokai."
"Mahope iho o ka lohe ana o Lonoikamakahiki i keia leo, alaila, ninau aku oia i ka wahine kaikuahine ona: “E, aloha mai la nae hoi ko ipo ia oe o Heakekoa.” Aole nae he ekemu aku o Kaikilani, aka, ua lohe no i ka ninau mai a ke kane, hoolalau wale iho la no ua o Kaikilani: “O ke kui keia, a o ka holo kela, mau kawa, ninole ka luna, hapala ka ele, na ke kea ka ai.” Ia manawa, lalau aku la ua o Lonoikamakahiki i ka papa konane, a hahau aku la i ke poo o ka wahine, a eha aku la o Kaikilani, aka, ua koe no nae ke ola.","After Lonoikamakahiki had made out the calls, he then asked of his cousin, his wife: “Say! Your lover Heakekoa sends you his love, I hear.” Kaikilani did not make answer to the question put by her husband, however, but continued in her deception, by saying: “This here is won; that is on the run, steady progress, the top is falling, the blacks are indistinct; the whites have won.” At this, Lonoikamakahiki took up the konane board and struck his wife on the head, inflicting painful wounds, but not severe enough, however, to kill her."
"Nolaila, huhu nui loa iho la o Lonoikamakahiki, a pono ole kona manao, me ka manao e hoohiki, aole e launa hou me Kaikilani; aka, iloko wale iho no ia ona, aole i hoopuka ma ke akea, alaila, hoomaau ae la oia i kana wahine, a hookaawale aku la.

[ ]","Because of this, the anger of Lonoikamakahiki was aroused and his mind was greatly troubled; he then made an oath that he would never again live with Kaikilani. This oath, however, he maintained within himself, not voicing it to any one. He then put her aside and refused to have anything to do with her. Because of this Kaikilani returned to Hawaii without meeting Heakekoa again, Kaikilani promising herself to have nothing more to do with Heakekoa, knowing full well that if she did she would in all likelihood be killed by Lonoikamakahiki, her husband; therefore she made up her mind to renounce Heakekoa forever. [ ]"
"A no keia hana ana a Lonoikamakahiki i ka wahine, nolaila, ua kui aku ka lono a lohe o Kanaloakuaana, nolaila, manao ae la na ’lii o Hawaii e kipi aku ia Lonoikamakahiki.

When Kaikilani arrived on Hawaii, on her return from Molokai, she found that Kanaloakuaana together with the chiefs of Hawaii had placed guards at all the landing places of Hawaii. This was done by their orders, because they had heard that Kaikilani was almost killed by Lonoikamakahiki."
"Hoi loa aku la o Kaikilani a Napoopoo, ua hao ae la na ’lii apau o Hawaii e kipi ia Lonoikamakahiki. A no ia mea, he nui loa ko Kaikilani manao aloha no Lonoikamakahiki, no ka mea, aole he like o kona manao me ko Kanaloakuaana ma ame na ’lii e ae.

Ma ia imi ana a Kaikilani, ua hala aku o Lonoikamakahiki i Oahu.","On this return Kaikilani proceeded to Napoopoo and there found that all the chiefs of Hawaii had taken everything for themselves and were in open revolt against Lonoikamakahiki. Upon seeing this, Kaikilani’s love for Lonoikamakahiki returned and she took pity on him, and was not in sympathy with the wish of Kanaloakuaana and the other chiefs. Because of this Kaikilani began to entertain a desire to go back and make a search for Lonoikamakahiki to inform him of the open revolt of the chiefs of Hawaii. On this return of Kaikilani, Lonoikamakahiki had in the meantime continued on his journey and was on Oahu."
"Mahope iho o ko Kaikilani hoi ana i Hawaii mai Molokai aku, alaila, ma ka pau ana o na la ino, kupono no ka holo moana, alaila holo aku la o Lonoikamakahiki mai Kalaupapa aku, a pae ma Kailua i Koolaupoko ma Oahu.","After Kaikilani’s return to Hawaii from Molokai, and the inclement weather had ceased, making the ocean fit for traveling, then Lonoikamakahiki set sail from Kalaupapa for Oahu, landing at Kailua in Koolaupoko. Upon the arrival of Lonoikamakahiki he found that Kakuhihewa was living at Kailua, residing at his palace."
"Ia hiki ana aku o Lonoikamakahiki, aia no o Kakuhihewa malaila kahi i noho ai, maloko o kona hale alii. I ka wa e holo aku ana o Lonoikamakahiki, ike mua aku la no o Lanahuimihaku ma i na waa o Keawenuiaumi, alaila, olelo aku la ia Kakuhihewa: “O ke alii o Hawaii, o Lonoikamakahiki.” A no ko Kakukihewa ma lohe ana, he kanaka akamai o Lonoikamakahiki i ka hoopapa, nolaila, hoomakaukau mua o Kakuhihewa ma no ka hoopapa. A hiki aku la o Lonoikamakahiki, a kau na waa i uka, kiiia mai la na ukana ame ke alii pu, hoihoi ia aku la a ka hale alii o Kakuhihewa.","When Lonoikamakahiki was approaching Kailua, Lanahuimihaku and his companion recognized the canoe of Keawenuiaumi, so they said to Kakuhihewa: “It is the king of Hawaii, Lonoikamakahiki.” As Kakuhihewa and the others had heard that Lonoikamakahiki was a man well versed in the arts of hoopapa, they therefore made preparations and awaited for the arrival of Lonoikamakahiki with everything ready for a contest. Upon the arrival of Lonoikamakahiki, and the double canoe was hauled ashore, the king and the baggage were taken up and carried to the palace of Kakuhihewa."
"I kekahi la ae, hiki mai la o Ohaikawiliula, kekahi alii wahine mai Kauai mai, a no ka nui akamai o Lonoikamakahiki ame kona naauao loa nolaila, lawe ae la ua o Lonoikamakahiki ia Ohaikawiliula i wahine moe nana ia po, i kumu e loaa hou ai iaia kekahi mau kumu hoopapa.

She was a chiefess from Kauai, and because of the great cunning and learning displayed by Lonoikamakahiki he won Ohaikawiliula and was allowed the honor of entertaining her that night, thereby giving him further subjects with which to carry on in the game of hoopapa. After having won Ohaikawiliula for the one night, without ever having an idea of committing any sin with the chiefess from Kauai, only wishing to procure further subjects for his contest with Kakuhihewa, they removed themselves to the end of the house set apart for the use of Lonoikamakahiki. After they had talked of various matters Lonoikamakahiki asked of the chiefess: “When you set sail from Kauai, were you in possession of any new chant having its origin in Kauai?” Ohaikawiliula answered: “There is a [ ] chant, but it is one relating to myself.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked: “Is it a new chant?” Ohaikawiliula again replied: “Yes, it is a very late one. It has not become known in the country districts. It was chanted only in the royal court up to the time of my departure.” Lonoikamakahiki again asked her: “What is the title of the chant?” Ohaikawiliula replied: “The Mirage of Mana.” After this conversation between the two, Lonoikamakahiki began the study of the chant until dawn, by which time he had committed it to memory."
"A ma ke ao ana ae, hoomakaukau ae la o Ohaikawiliula e holo i Hawaii no ke kii ia Manuahi i kane nana. Ia manawa, i na waa e hoomaka aku ana e holo, aole nae i kau aku ke alii wahine, i aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa: “E hele aku oe e noi aku i ke alii wahine o Kauai i mele, malia he wahi mele hou kekahi o Kauai mai i loaa iaia, alaila, ao ae kakou, no ka mea, e lilo e aku auanei i ke alii o Hawaii (Lonoikamakahiki), a malia o ae mai ua o Ohaikawiliula, alaila, nou ka inoa; aia la he alii inoa ole.” A no keia olelo ana a Lanahuimihaku ma pela, nolaila, hele aku la o Kakuhihewa me kona mau kanaka, a hiki i kahi e lana la na waa, a paa aku la o Kakuhihewa ma na lima o ke alii wahine (Ohaikawiliula) me ka ninau aku: “Holo mai nei oe mai Kauai mai, aole he wahi mele hou o Kauai i loaa ia oe?” Hai aku la o Ohaikawiliula: “He mele no.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “He mele hou loa aole i laha i ke kuaaina?” I hou aku o Ohaikawiliula: “Aole i laha i ke kuaaina, i ke alo alii wale iho no a hele wale mai la wau, he wahi inoa no no’u.” Ninau hou aku la o Kakuhihewa: “Owai ua wahi mele la?” “O Kealialia liu o Mana.”","At daylight the next day Ohaikawiliula made preparation to set sail for Hawaii, where she was going to meet her future husband, Manuahi. While this preparation was going on, and the double canoe was being hauled into the sea (the chiefess had not boarded it, however), Lanahuimihaku and his companion said to Kakuhihewa: “You had better run out and ask the chiefess of Kauai for a new chant. It is possible that she knows a late chant from Kauai, then we will study it, else it will be first acquired by the king of Hawaii, Lonoikamakahiki. Ohaikawiliula will surely give her permission that it be used in honor of your name, for Lonoikamakahiki is a chief without any chant dedicated to his name.” Because of these words, spoken by Lanahuimihaku and his companion, Kakuhihewa and his servants went up to where the double canoe was moored and Kakuhihewa reached out and held the chiefess, Ohaikawiliula by the arm, then asked her: “Before setting sail from Kauai, did you not hear of a new chant belonging to Kauai?” Ohaikawiliula replied: “I have a chant.” Kakuhihewa again asked: “Is it a very late one, not heard in the country districts?” Ohaikawiliula replied: “It has not been heard in the country districts; it was used only at the royal court up to the time of my departure. It is one used in honor of my name.” Kakuhihewa again asked: “What is the title of the chant?” “It is ‘The Mirage of Mana,’ ” replied Ohaikawiliula."
"Alaila, ao aku la ua o Kakuhihewa i ua mele nei, ma ka haawi pakahi ana i na lalani mele i na kanaka, a pau ua mele nei, holo aku la o Ohaikawiliula i Hawaii, a hoi aku la no hoi o Kakuhihewa i ka hale me na kanaka, a hookuikui ae la i na hua i haawi pakahi ia i na kanaka, a lilo ae la i mele e like me ko lakou aoia ana e ka mea nana i ao mai ia lakou.","Kakuhihewa then proceeded to master the chant by giving each of his servants a line to commit to memory. After this was done, Ohaikawiliula proceeded on her way to Hawaii, while Kakuhihewa and his servants returned to the house, where the chant was connected line by line, as committed to memory by the servants, until it was mastered in whole just as given them by Ohaikawiliula."
"Aka, i ka manawa i ao ai o Kakuhihewa me Ohaikawiliula i ua mele nei, he mea nani loa nae i ke alii wahine ka hai ole aku ia Kakuhihewa, ua ao ia o Lonoikamakahiki i ua mele nei, aole no hoi i puka iki aku kekahi hua olelo mai kona waha aku; aka, no ka poina loa ana paha, ina paha ua hai oia ua aoia ia Lonoikamakahiki ua mele la, ina ua lilo ole i kumu hoopapa.","When Kakuhihewa was being taught the chant by Ohaikawiliula, it was very considerate of her not to have informed him that she had already taught the same to Lonoikamakahiki. She did not even say a word about the matter; probably she had forgotten all about it. If she had told Kakuhihewa of teaching Lonoikamakahiki the chant it would not have been taken for a subject in the game of hoopapa that followed."
"Mahope iho o ko Kakuhihewa ao ana i ke mele, hele ae la oia me kana mau punahele i ka heenalu, a o Lonoikamakahiki hoi kekahi ma ia hee nalu ana. A pau ka Kakuhihewa ma heenalu ana, hoi aku la lakou a ka hale. Ia manawa, olelo aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa: “E Kakuhihewa!

Lonoikamakahiki also accompanied the king of Oahu in this outing. When it became time for Kakuhihewa to cease surfing he returned to the house with his companions. Just as soon as they reached the house Lanahuimihaku and his companion said to Kakuhihewa: “Say, Kakuhihewa, when the king of Hawaii finishes riding the surf and should send for his loin cloth and kapa, then you refuse the taking [ ] of those things, and tell him that he shall not have the loin cloth and kapa unless he is able to recite the chant that we have just learned this morning.” Kakuhihewa then saw that the proposition spoken by Lanahuimihaku and his companion was a good one, so he carried out the advice given him by the two men."
"A o Lanahuimihaku ma, he mau kanaka punahele ia ma ko Lonoikamakahiki alo, a o laua no na kanaka nui o ko Lonoikamakahiki alo alii, a ua oi ae laua mamua o na kanaka a pau ma ko Lonoikamakahiki ku ana i ka moku; a no ka pau ana o ko Lanahuimihaku ma punahele, nolaila, haalele laua ia Lonoikamakahiki, a holo mai a noho me Kakuhihewa; a o keia mau kanaka, na kanaka i pilikia loa ai o Kakuhihewa ma.","Lanahuimihaku and his companion were great favorites in the court of Lonoikamakahiki prior to their coming to Oahu, and they were recognized as the most important men in the presence of the king. They were well treated and accorded the highest position over all the people when Lonoikamakahiki took charge of the affairs of the government. But there came a time when the king ceased thinking so very much of them; that they were no longer his favorites. Because of this neglect they left Lonoikamakahiki and came and lived with Kakuhihewa. It was these two men that caused great trouble for Kakuhihewa and his people."
"A i ka manawa i hoi mai ai o Lonoikamakahiki mai ka auau mai, hoi aku la a mawaho o ka hale alii o Kakuhihewa, i aku la i ke kahu ia Loli: “E kii aku oe i kuu wahi malo ame kuu wahi kihei.” A no keia olelo a ke alii, nolaila, kii aku la o Loli i ka malo o Lonoikamakahiki i loko o kona hokeo (Kuwalawala) maloko o ko Kakuhihewa hale, kahi i waiho ai, ma ke kala hoi i hookaawaleia nona.","When Lonoikamakahiki returned from having his bath and stood outside of Kakuhihewa’s palace, he said to his attendant, Loli: “You go in and bring out my loin cloth and my cloak.” Because of this order of the king Loli proceeded to get these things, they being in Lonoikamakahiki’s calabash, Kawalawala, which was in the palace, in the end of the house set apart for the use of the king."
"I ka manawa o Loli i komo aku ai i loko o ka hale, a wehe ae la i ka hokeo, kahi i waihoia aku ai na mea o ke alii.

When Kakuhihewa saw Loli uncovering the calabash he said to one of his own retainers: “You go and tell the servant of Lonoikamakahiki not to take the loin cloth until he can chant the mele in honor of the king’s name.” Because of this order from Kakuhihewa the retainer went to meet Loli and said to him: “What are you doing, uncovering the calabash of your ward?” Loli replied: “I am uncovering it for the loin cloth and kapa of the king.” Kakuhihewa’s retainer then said: “You must go back without it. You cannot have the loin cloth until the chant in honor of the king’s name is recited.” Loli then returned and Lonoikamakahiki asked of him: “Where is the loin cloth?” Loli replied: “The loin cloth cannot be had. Kakuhihewa has kept me from taking it. It is only when the chant in honor of Kakuhihewa is recited that the loin cloth can be given up.” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “You go back and get my loin cloth and bring it here, and if they should ask you about the chant, then ask them the title of the king’s chant.”"
"Hoi aku la o Loli a wehe hou no i ka hokeo; ninau hou mai ke kahu o Kakuhihewa: “Heaha kau hana i ka hokeo?” I aku o Loli: “I kii mai nei no wau i ka malo a me ke kapa o ke alii.” I aku la o Kakuhihewa: “He hoopaa anei oe; aole anei oe e lohe, ua oleloia aku nei oe, aia a loaa kuu inoa, alaila, loaa aku ka malo a me ke kapa.” Olelo aku la o Loli: “O ka’u ia i olelo aku nei i ke alii a’u, i mai nei kela, e hoi mai wau a ninau aku i kou inoa.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “O kuu inoa o Kealialia liu o Mana.”","Loli then returned into the house and again uncovered the calabash. The retainer of Kakuhihewa again asked: “What are you doing with the calabash?” Loli replied: “I have come for the king’s loin cloth and kapa.” Kakuhihewa then spoke up: “You are very stubborn. Have you not heard that you have been ordered that only when the chant in my honor can be recited can you get the loin cloth and kapa?” Loli then made reply: “That is just what I have told my king, but he ordered me to return here and ask for the title of your chant.” Kakuhihewa then said: “The title of the chant in honor of my name is ‘The Mirage of Mana.’ ”"
"Hoi wale aku la o Loli me ka nele i ka malo. Ninau mai la o Lonoikamakahiki: “Owai ka inoa o ke alii o Oahu?” Alaila, hai aku la kahi kahu, o Loli: “I mai nei, o [ ] Kealialia liu o Mana.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “O hoi a lawe mai i kuu malo, i olelo hou mai, alaila olelo aku oe, ua olelo aku wau: ‘O Kealialia liu o Mana’ inoa nei no o Lonoikamakahiki la? Pela oe e olelo aku ai.”","Loli was again forced to return without the loin cloth. Upon coming to Lonoikamakahiki he was asked: “What is the title of the chant in honor of the name of the king of Oahu?” The retainer Loli then told him: “He said it was ‘The Mirage of [ ] Mana.’ ” Lonoikamakahiki then said: “You go back and bring my loin cloth. If they should again ask you, you tell them that I have said, ‘The Mirage of Mana’ is the chant in honor of the name of Lonoikamakahiki. You repeat this to them.”"
"A pau ka laua kamailio ana no keia mau mea, a o ka laua olelo hope loa no hoi ia ma keia mau mea, alaila, hoi aku la o Loli a ka hale alii o Kakuhihewa, o Kamoa ka inoa o ua hale alii la.

Again Loli took up the calabash and began to uncover it for the loin cloth and kapa of his king. At this Kakuhihewa again asked: “Say, Loli, why are you again uncovering the calabash belonging to your ward?” Loli made reply: “It is for the king’s loin cloth.” Kakuhihewa said: “Have you not heard that you cannot get the loin cloth until the chant in my honor is recited?” Loli replied: “I have told him that, but he replied by asking, ‘What is the title of the chant of Kakuhihewa?’ I replied: ‘The Mirage of Mana.’ He made reply: ‘Is it “The Mirage of Mana,” the chant in honor of the name of Lonoikamakahiki?’ This is the reply made by my king, and that is all.” Because of this reply made by Loli, Kakuhihewa asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Is this chant really in honor of the name of the king of Hawaii?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “It is a lie; he has no chant in honor of his name like this one. He is a chief without a chant. You must not be afraid; make a wager with him.”"
"Mahope iho o ko Kakuhihewa lohe ana ia Loli no ko Lonoikamakahiki hai ana mai, nona ka inoa, ke mele hoi a laua e hoopapa nei, alaila, olelo pu ae la na ’lii a elua, no na kumu pili a laua; a maopopo ae la, haawi mai la o Kakuhihewa i ka aina, mai ka lae o Leahi a ka lae o Kaena mau ia Eleeleualani, ke kahili nui o Lonoikamakahiki.

After this was agreed on the two kings came together to decide on their bets. Some time was taken up in this before they agreed upon the different objects for the wager. Kakuhihewa on his side offered that portion of Oahu from Leahi point to the Kaena point as against the large feather kahili of Lonoikamakahiki, Eleeleualani. Lonoikamakahiki on his side would not agree to this, saying: “I will not wager my feather kahili for that amount of land.” Because Lonoikamakahiki refused to agree to this offer made by Kakuhihewa, Kakuhihewa again offered all the lands, in addition to the former offer, embraced within the point of Kaena to the Kaoio point at Kualoa."
"A no keia pili ana mai a Kakuhihewa, aneane e pau loa o Oahu nei, alaila, olelo aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Aole e mau kuu kahili ia pili.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “Ole ae la ka’u pili, ia oe mai hoi ia wahi.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “O kuu kahili a [ ] mau ia loko o ka hale, alaila, ae wau.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “Ua mau; o loko wale ae la no ka hoi o ka hale ka pili o kou kahili la, mai lilo hewa ka aina ia oe.”","Because of this last offer made by Kakuhihewa, which really meant the passing away from him of almost all the lands of Oahu, Lonoikamakahiki replied: “I will not allow my feather kahili to be wagered for the amount of land you offer.” Kakuhihewa then replied: “Since you have not agreed to my offer, make your offer then.” Lonoikamakahiki said: “I will wager my feather kahili as against the inside of this house.” Kakuhihewa then made answer: “That is agreed; here it is. You are satisfied with [ ] the inside of the house as against your kahili, while I was offering you almost all my possessions, which I had the chance of losing to you.”"
"A pau ka laua pili ana, akahi no a haawaiia aku ka malo a me ke kapa o Lonoikamakahiki. I aku o Kakuhihewa: “Ia oe mua; e hana mai oe i kou inoa, a pau hoi kau hana ana, alaila, ia makou aku.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ia oukou paha mua, i ka poe lawe wale i ka inoa o kekahi; no oukou iho la ka hoi ia inoa; a o ke akaka ia o ko oukou inoa. A pau hoi ka oukou, alaila, ia’u aku.”","After the wagers had been agreed on, the loin cloth and kapa of Lonoikamakahiki were given up at last. Kakuhihewa then said: “You recite the chant first, for you have claimed that the chant was one in honor of your name. After you have finished, then we will recite ours.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “You people had better make the first recital, since I have claimed that you have appropriated the chant belonging to others and are claiming it your own. In this way we will ascertain positively whether the chant is yours. After you have finished, then I will make my recital.”"
"A no ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo ana aku ia Kakuhihewa pela, alaila, lilo mua ae la ia Kakuhihewa ka hana mua o ke mele a lakou i ao ai me Ohaikawiliula. A eia malalo iho ua wahi mele la a laua e hoopapa nei:","Because of this argument advanced by Lonoikamakahiki, Kakuhihewa agreed that they make the first recital of the chant taught them by Ohaikawiliula. Following is the chant that caused the dispute:"
"O Kealialia liu o Mana. Ke uhai la no. Ke uhai la ka wai, Ke uhai la ka wai a Kamakahou; Wai alialia, Wai o Mana. Me he kai la ka wai, Me he wai la ke kai, Me he kai la ka wai a Kamakahou.

The water is following, The water of Kamakahou is following; The water that is not water, The mirage of Mana. Like the sea is the water, Like the water is the sea, Like the sea is the water of Kamakahou. The sugar-cane trash from my eating was cast away. After I had gone beyond I failed to recognize. What was seen behind, again appears in front. The Iliau has wilted in the sun [As] the plentiful dew of the morning. Passed are the emblems of the god of the year, Gone to bury the dead [On] the barren sands of Nonohili. The coconut grove bends low seaward of Pokii, In reverence to [the god] Makalii."
"“Aia la, holo ko makou inoa, a ia oe hoi.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Aole no oukou ka inoa, no’u ka inoa.” I aku la o Kakuhihewa: “O ke akaka ia o kou inoa ke hana mai oe.” Alaila, hana aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i kona inoa ponoi a Hauna i ao mai ai ia ia, a hoohuipu aku la me ke mele a ka wahine o Kauai i ao mai ai ia laua, e like me malalo iho: [ ]","“There, that is the chant in honor of our name. Now it is your turn.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “The chant is not yours, it is mine.” Kakuhihewa said: “We will know it is your chant, without any doubt, after you have recited it.” Lonoikamakahiki then began the recital of the chant, first taking the chant in his own name as taught him by Hauna, and at the end he added on the chant taught him by the chiefess from Kauai. Following is the chant in full: [ ]"
"Ma keia wahi, e hookomo iho i ke mele i koe, he wahi inoa no no Lonoikamakahiki, a oia ke mele i lohe ai o Lanahuimihaku, a oia ke mele i kamau ia mai maluna o ke mele a laua i ao ia ai e Ohaikawiliula.","One can here follow on with the portion of the chant that remains. It is also a chant in honor of the name of Lonoikamakahiki, which is the one that Lanahuimihaku heard, and it is often added to the chant taught them by Ohaikawiliula."
"I kela manawa a Lonoikamakahiki e heluhelu ana i kela mele a Ohaikawiliula i ao ai ia Kakuhihewa ma, a ike aku la ua loaa kela mele ia Lonoikamakahiki, i aku la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “E!

Malia paha ua holo ae kekahi waa ma ka moana ae, a Hawaii, ao mai nei i keia mele.”","When Lonoikamakahiki was repeating the chant which Ohaikawiliula had taught Kakuhihewa, Kakuhihewa saw that Lonoikamakahiki knew it, so he said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Say, I see that Lonoikamakahiki knows of this chant?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied, saying to Kakuhihewa: “Yes, we see that he does. We lived with him while in Hawaii, but he had no chant of this kind. It is possible, however, that a canoe has gone to Hawaii without touching here and the chant was carried to Hawaii in that way.”"
"I ka manawa i eo ai o Kakuhihewa ma ia Lonoikamakahiki, alaila, kena ae la o Kakuhihewa i na kanaka a pau o loko o ka hale, e puka i waho a koe iho ka hale no ke alii o Hawaii no Lonoikamakahiki.

Eia ka i pili aku nei oe e make makou.”","After Kakuhihewa was beaten by Lonoikamakahiki, Kakuhihewa ordered all the people to get out of the house and thus leave the house to Lonoikamakahiki, the king of Hawaii, who had won. When this order was given Lonoikamakahiki was standing just outside of the door with a war club in his hands. As soon as the order was given to vacate the house the men immediately proceeded to go out; but as soon as the first party started out they were killed by Lonoikamakahiki. When the people saw this they retreated back into the house for they were afraid of being put to death by Lonoikamakahiki. When Kakuhihewa saw the people coming back into the house he asked: “Why are you people coming back? Don’t you know that we have to get out and leave the house to Lonoikamakahiki?” The people replied: “Don’t you know that you made a foolish bet? Such and such persons have been killed by Lonoikamakahiki. Here you have made a wager whereby we are to be killed.”"
"A lohe o Kakuhihewa i keia leo, alaila, olelo aku la oia ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ea! He oiaio kela olelo?” I aku o ua o Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ae, he oiaio, no ka [ ] mea, pili aku nei kakou i ka aina, a he puni wale ae no koe o Oahu nei, aole kela i ae mai e pili i ko iala kahili, nolaila pili mai nei kela ia loko o ka hale nei; i pili mai kela nou no ke alii a me na kanaka, o ka pau no i ka make. Eo aku la kakou. Kahea ia aku ua alii la, e ola kakou.” Alaila, kahea aku la o Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Hawaii e! E ola. Ua eo ia oe.”","When Kakuhihewa heard this from the people, he said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Say, is this true?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion then replied: [ ] “Yes, it is true, because when you offered to wager your lands until there remained but a very small portion of Oahu he refused and would not wager his feather kahili for all the land you offered; but he accepted instead the inside of this house. He took this offer because of yourself the king, and your people, in order to kill us. We are beaten. You had better cry out to the king for mercy, and that we be saved.” Kakuhihewa then called out: “Say, King of Hawaii, have mercy! You have won.”"
"A lohe o Lonoikamakahiki i keia olelo, a me ka leo kahea maloko mai, alaila, hooko ae la oia aole e luku aku e like me kana noonoo mua ana, a ma ka inoa o kona kanawai mau, “Kai Okia Kanawai,” nolaila, aole he luku hou ana a Lonoikamakahiki i koe. A oia no hoi ka hoomaka mua ana o ka Lonoikamakahiki hoopapa ana.","When Lonoikamakahiki heard this call for mercy, together with the cries of the people, he desisted and allowed the people to get away, and in the name of his regularly accepted law, “Mercy has rendered the law useless,” he withheld his hand and would not attack the people further. This was the beginning of the many hoopapa contests of Lonoikamakahiki."
"Mahope iho o keia eo ana o Kakuhihewa ma ia Lonoikamakahiki, alaila, olelo aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa, me ka i aku: “E Kakuhihewa, he nani ia ua eo ae nei kakou i ke alii o Hawaii ma keia pili ana; o kana eo hoi ia.

Our idea is this: we think it a good plan that we go out fishing. It is more than possible that the king of Hawaii can be enticed to follow us out, and if he does, and he gets excited over the sport, he will surely ask us for hook, line and bait; then we will shame him, for he is a king without any knowledge of the art of fishing. If this can be done we will be able to defeat him, and you will then get his feather kahili.”"
"A no ia mea, hooholo ae la o Kakuhihewa i kona manao ae, mamuli o ka Lanahuimihaku ma olelo, me ke kanalua ole, no ka mea, o na mea a pau a Lanahuimihaku ma e olelo ai, malaila wale no o Kakuhihewa e hilinai ai.","Because of this, Kakuhihewa made up his mind to agree to this proposition expressed by Lanahuimihaku and his companion, so all doubts were removed from his mind as to his ability to win the feather kahili, and being easily led by Lanahuimihaku and his companion, Kakuhihewa of course consented. It was a common thing with Kakuhihewa to give in to the wishes of the two men, for he had the most implicit confidence in them."
"I ke kakahiaka o kekahi la ae, hoomakaukau ae la o Kakuhihewa ma i na waa, a holo aku la i ka lawaia ma ke koa lawaia i oleloia o Akaka, mawaho pono aku o Kailua, ma kahi e ike aku ana ia Kahuku, ma Koolauloa, a me Mokuoniki ma ka aoao hikina o Molokai.","On the morning of the day after, Kakuhihewa and his men made ready the double canoe and set out for the fishing grounds for a day of fishing. The fishing grounds they decided to go to that day were the ones called Akaka, directly out of Kailua, at a point from which Kahuku in Koolauloa and Mokuoniki on the east of Molokai could be seen."
"A ike aku la o Lonoikamakahiki e holo ana o Kakuhihewa i ka lawaia, alaila olelo aku la ua o Lonoikamakahiki i ke kahu ia Loli: “E aho paha e hahai kakou mahope o Kakuhihewa ma, e makaikai aku ai i ka lawaia a ke alii o Oahu nei.” I aku la o Loli i kana hanai: “Mai une oe ia kakou e holo i kai, ina e paakiki oe o ko’u make no ia, no ka mea, aole oe i ike i ka lawaia.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki ia Loli “Heaha auanei kou kumu e make wale iho ai?” I aku la ke kahu: “Eia hoi kuu mea e make ai, o ka holo o kaua a ka moana nana aku oe i ka lawaia a Kakuhihewa ma, [ ] lealea aku oe i ka lakou la huki mai i ka ia.

Because of that desire you will ask for hook and line, and they will refuse and insult you with such expression as this: ‘Where have you been that you should come here unprepared?’ Therefore you will be ashamed; and this will cause my death.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “Why should they refuse to give me hook and line? Only the ignorant will refuse to give hook and line.” The attendant said: “Yes, that would be the proper way of reasoning if things were right between you, but as things stand now they do not think well of you, for you have beaten them, and for this reason they will refuse giving you what you ask.” But with all this advice given by his attendant the king’s desire to go out was not abated; in fact, the desire became stronger, and Lonoikamakahiki finally demanded of his servant that they follow Kakuhihewa and his companions and look on while they fished."
"A no ko ke alii manao paa loa, nolaila, olelo aku la o Loli ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Auhea oe? He nani ia ke paakiki la oe i ka holo i kai; a ina holo kaua i kai, a i lealea aku oe i ka huki mai a Kakuhihewa ma i ka ia, a ina i noi aku oe i ke aho ame ka makau, a me na mea lawaia a pau, a i pakikeia mai oe, alaila, pepehi iho oe ia’u a make, lawe ae oe i kuu naau i aho nau, o kuu iwi papakole no kau makau, maunu iho oe i kuu io, a o kuu poo no kau paka, alaila, kuu iho no oe i ke kai, a kuehu ae i ka paka, alaila, kahea iho oe ma kuu inoa: ‘E, Loli e!

Since you have become stubborn about going fishing, I want you to bear in mind what I have to say to you. After we come up to Kakuhihewa and his companions, and you should wish to do some fishing yourself after seeing Kakuhihewa haul out several fish, and if you should ask for hook and line and they should refuse and insult you, then you must kill me, take out my intestine and use it for a line, and my thigh bone for your hook; then take my flesh and use it for your bait, and my head you can use as a sinker; then lower the whole thing into the sea and, after giving a jerk, call out in my name as follows: ‘Say, Loli! Say, Loli, the fish without eyes!! Catch a fish for us, Loli.’ Then you will hook an ahi.” After giving Lonoikamakahiki these instructions they proceeded out to sea."
"He mau kanaka kaulana laua ma na moku a puni, no ko laua mana a me ko laua malama ana i ke akua, a he hiki ia laua ke hana i na hana mana he nui, ma ka inoa o ko Keawenuiaumi akua.

It was because of this great power that Loli was able to see the future and so instructed his king Lonoikamakahiki to kill him in order to obtain line, hook and bait."
KA HOLO ANA O LONOIKAMAKAHIKI E MAKAIKAI I KA LAWAIA A KAKUHIHEWA MA.,HOW LONOIKAMAKAHIKI FOLLOWED TO SEE KAKUHIHEWA AND HIS COMPANIONS FISH.

This rock was a very small one for the purpose, but to prove the supernatural powers of Hauna it served the purpose as an anchor, although a strong gale came up and for a short time it blew quite fiercely. When the storm was blowing, the rock that served as an anchor for the double canoe of Kakuhihewa was unable to hold the canoe and so it was carried off to the leeward of the fishing grounds for some distance. The double canoe of Lonoikamakahiki, however, never moved a bit, and the small rock held it as though a large anchor had been used. This was because of the supernatural powers of Hauna."
"Ia manawa, makemake aku la o Kakuhihewa i ka pohaku hekau o ke alii o Hawaii. Alaila manao ae la oia (Kakuhihewa) o ko Lonoikamakahiki kumu pili ia e pili mai ai ia Kakuhihewa.","When Kakuhihewa saw how the double canoe of the king of Hawaii was held by the small mooring rock he expressed the desire of possessing it, so he immediately made up his mind to name the rock in his next wager with Lonoikamakahiki."
"Ia Lonoikamakahiki ma e lana ana maluna o na waa, i aku la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “Kupanaha ka pohaku hekau o ke alii o Hawaii.” I aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ae, ua ike maua i kela pohaku lana o ke alii o Hawaii, he nui wale ka pohaku i like me kela.” A no keia olelo a Lanahuimihaku ma, manao o Kakuhihewa e kii i pohaku nana i Hawaii.

We have seen several rocks like that.” Because of this answer given by Lanahuimihaku and his companion, Kakuhihewa thought he would send for one like it from Hawaii, but Lanahuimihaku and his companion said: “You cannot make use of that kind of rock, however, because your attendants do not possess supernatural powers. That rock holds that canoe because of the supernatural powers of Hauna.”"

Ina he mau mea lawaia ka ua alii la o Hawaii alaila hewa io.” Alaila pau ae la ko Kakuhihewa manao ana pela.","When Lonoikamakahiki and his companions were moored directly at the bow of the double canoe of Kakuhihewa, Kakuhihewa was sore displeased, for he knew that such a thing was not considered right by all fishermen. This displeasure was so strong that he spoke of the matter and remarked that he did not at all like the way Lonoikamakahiki’s double canoe was moored. But Lanahuimihaku and his companion, however, said: “Don’t at all mind it. If the king of Hawaii has any fishing implements with him then it would be wrong.” This reply satisfied Kakuhihewa for he thought no more of the matter."
"Ia manawa a Kakuhihewa ma e kamailio ana me Lanahuimihaku ma, lou ana ka ia ia Kakuhihewa. I aku la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “E! Lou ka ia, heaha la?” I aku o Lanahuimihaku ma: “He ulua. Ninau ia aku ke alii o Hawaii.” A no ia mea, kahea aku la o Kakuhihewa: “Ahaha! E, ke alii o Hawaii, he aha ka ia?” I aku o Loli ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Koho ia aku he mano.” I aku la o Lonoikamakahiki e like me ka Loli olelo: “He mano.”","While Kakuhihewa and Lanahuimihaku and his companion were talking, Kakuhihewa felt a fish tugging at his hook, so he said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Say, I have caught a fish. What can it be?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion said: “It must be an ulua. Ask the king of Hawaii what it is.” Because of this, Kakuhihewa called out: “There you are! Say, King of Hawaii, what kind of a fish have I caught?” Loli said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Tell him that it is a shark.” Lonoikamakahiki therefore replied as directed by Loli, saying: “It is a shark.”"
"A no ke koho ana aku a Lonoikamakahiki he mano, nolaila, ninau ae la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “He mano io anei?” I aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma: “Aole he mano, ua wahahee ke alii o Hawaii, lawaia auanei hoi kakou i keia koa a kakou e lawaia nei, he mano kekahi. Kai noa, ua hoolaaia keia koa i ke akua, aole e komo ka mano i keia koa. Piliia aku, akahi hana ana a ke alii o Hawaii e eo ai.” [ ]",Because Lonoikamakahiki had named the fish to be a shark Kakuhihewa asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Is it a shark?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “It is not a shark. The king of Hawaii deceives himself. Here we have been fishing on these grounds many times and we never have caught a single shark. You also know that these fishing grounds have been dedicated to our god and [ ] no shark can come here. Make a wager with him. You will for the first time beat the king of Hawaii now.”
"A nolaila, ma ka olelo a Lanahuimihaku ma, olelo aku la o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki: “E ke alii o Hawaii, e pono no paha ke pili, ina no hoi he mano, ua eo makou ia oe, aka hoi he ulua ka ia e paa nei i ka makou makau, alaila ua eo oe ia makou.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “I aha ka pili?” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “Mai Leahi a hiki i ka lae o Kaena, mau i ko wahi pohaku lana.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua mau.” Alaila huki ae la o Kakuhihewa i ke aho, a i ke kokoke ana ae i luna, alaila i aku o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “He mano.

A no ia mea, i mai o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua eo, no ko makou ike maoli ana he koa mano ole keia, nolaila wale no makou i pili ino aku ai.”","Because of these words of Lanahuimihaku and his companion, Kakuhihewa said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Say, King of Hawaii, we had better make a wager. If it is a shark you beat us; but if the fish I hold should prove to be an ulua, then we beat you.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “What shall our wagers be?” Kakuhihewa said: “From Leahi to the Kaena point, I will place against your mooring rock.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “It is a bet.” Kakuhihewa then pulled on his line and when the fish was almost to the surface, Kakuhihewa said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “It is a shark. We have lost to the king of Hawaii.” Lanahuimihaku and his companion then looked down and when they saw it was a shark they nodded to Kakuhihewa to let go the line so as to allow the shark to break away and in that way get rid of it before the others could see it. But Lonoikamakahiki had seen the nod and at once saw the intention of Kakuhihewa and his companions to allow the fish to break away from the line; so he called out to Kakuhihewa and the others: “Say, King of Oahu, don’t play false and allow the fish to get away by letting go of the line. If you don’t see the shark, pull it in to be certain.” Kakuhihewa was therefore forced to pull on the line and after a while they all saw plainly that it was a shark. Because of this Kakuhihewa said to Lonoikamakahiki: “You have won. It was because we were certain that no sharks came to these fishing grounds that we made the wager with you.”"
"He oiaio he koa mano ole kela, no ka mea, ua hoomanamanaia kela koa i mua o ke akua, aole e komo mai ka mano. Aka, ma ka mana o Loli a me Hauna, ua lilo ke koa mano ole i koa mano. A eo ae la o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki, a lilo ae la kekahi hapa o Oahu nei ia Lonoikamakahiki, mai Leahi a Kaena.","It was a well-known fact that no sharks were caught on these fishing grounds, as the place was dedicated to the gods, hence no sharks were supposed to get there, as the gods had charge of the place; but by the supernatural powers of Loli and Hauna the fishing grounds known to be without sharks became a place infested with them. Having won the wager, Kakuhihewa lost to Lonoikamakahiki that portion of Oahu from Leahi to Kaena point, which became the property of Lonoikamakahiki."
"Mahope iho o keia mau mea, kupu ae la ko Lonoikamakahiki manao lealea i ka lawaia, alaila, olelo aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Oahu! Homai hoi kau wahi makau, i wahi aho mai me ka maunu, a i paka mai no.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “I hea no hoi kou makaukau hele pu mai oe, o ka makou ka kau mea i manao ai, i anei kou lako?” I aku ke kahu o Loli: “E kuu alii! A, hilahila oe; kai noa o ka’u ia e olelo aku ana ia oe, aole kaua e holo mai i kai nei; a nolaila, pepehiia iho wau.”","After this had taken place the desire to take a hand at fishing overcame Lonoikamakahiki, so he said to Kakuhihewa: “Say, King of Oahu, let me have a hook, line and some bait and also a sinker.” Kakuhihewa replied: “Why did you not come prepared when you came out to fish? Did you suppose that we were to supply you with these things necessary for a fisherman?” Loli, the attendant, then said: “My king, you have been shamed. This is what I expected and therefore warned you that we had better not come out. Now, therefore, you must kill me.”"
"A e like me ka olelo mua a kona kahu, pepehi iho la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Loli, a hana iho la e like me ka Loli aoao ana. A kuu iho la i ke kai, a olelo iho la e like me ka Loli olelo mua: “E, Loli!

He then called the words taught him by Loli, saying: “Say, Loli! Say, Loli, the fish without eyes of the sea!! Catch us a fish, Loli.” At that very moment, as soon as the last word was spoken, an ahi bit his hook. As soon as he felt the bite Lonoikamakahiki called out: “Say, Kakuhihewa, what kind of a fish have I caught?” Kakuhihewa hesitated for a while, then asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “What kind of a fish has the king of Hawaii caught?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “Name it a shark, because the first fish caught being a shark there must be a lot of them down below.” Because of this, and [ ] in accordance with the words of Lanahuimihaku and his companion, he answered Lonoikamakahiki, saying: “It is a shark.” Lonoikamakahiki answered back: “No, you are mistaken, King of Oahu.” Kakuhihewa then asked Lonoikamakahiki: “And what do you say it is?” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “This is not a shark, it is an ahi.”"
"A no keia olelo ana aku a Lonoikamakahiki pela, alaila, ninau ae la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “He ahi io anei ka ia a ke alii o Hawaii?” I mai o Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ua wahahee ke alii o Hawaii. Kai noa ua ike no kakou aole he mau koa lawaia ahi o Oahu nei, o Niihau ame Hawaii wale no na aina koa ahi; pili ia aku.” Kahea aku la o Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Hawaii e! E pili no hoi paha; mai ka lae o Kaena a ka lae o Kaoio, mau i ko wahi pohaku lana.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua mau.”","Because of this reply made by Lonoikamakahiki, Kakuhihewa therefore asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Is the fish caught by the king of Hawaii really an ahi?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “The king of Hawaii is deceiving us. Don’t you know that everybody knows that no ahi can be caught in Oahu, and that such fish can only be caught at Niihau and Hawaii fishing stations? Make a wager with him.” Kakuhihewa then called out: “Say, King of Hawaii, let us settle on a wager then. From the Kaena point to the Kaoio point as against your mooring rock.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “It is a bet.”"
"Alaila, ma ka pau ana o ka pili a laua, huki ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i ke aho, a kokoke e ikeia ka ia, ia manawa, ahai pono aku la ua ia nei a Lonoikamakahiki malalo pono o na waa o Kakuhihewa ma.

Alaila, i aku o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa: “Ua eo kakou i ke alii o Hawaii, eia la he ahi io ka ia a ke alii.”","As soon as the wager was settled Lonoikamakahiki pulled on the line and when the fish was almost to the surface he allowed it to pull away directly below the double canoe of Kakuhihewa and his companions. At this time Kakuhihewa and his men made out that the fish caught by Lonoikamakahiki was an ahi. As the fish was plainly seen Lanahuimihaku and his companion said to Kakuhihewa: “We are beaten by the king of Hawaii, for here it is; the fish is really an ahi.”"
"A pili ae la ka ia ma ka aoao o na waa o Lonoikamakahiki ma, lawe ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i ka lei lehua a me ka lei hala i hoomakaukau mua ia, a hookomo ae la ma ka api o ka ia, ma na aoao elua, a kahea aku la ia Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Oahu e! Mai Hawaii loa mai nei ka keia ia. O ke ahi mahaoo o Umulau, eia la ke lei mai nei i ka lei hala a me ka lei lehua.”","When the fish came up to the side of the canoe of Lonoikamakahiki, Lonoikamakahiki took a wreath of lehua blossoms and a wreath of hala, which had been made ready beforehand for this purpose, and put them around the gills of the fish, and then called out to Kakuhihewa: “Say, King of Oahu, this fish must have come all the way from Hawaii, for it is the yellow-gilled ahi of Umulau, for it is wearing wreaths of hala and of lehua.”"
"A lohe o Kakuhihewa i keia olelo a Lonoikamakahiki, he mea kupanaha ia ia Kakuhihewa ma. Alaila olelo aku la, ia Lanahuimihaku ma, me ka ninau aku: “Ea, ua ike anei olua, he lei mai no ko Hawaii ahi i ka lehua a me ka hala?” I aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ua wahahee keia hana ana a ke alii o Hawaii. Piliia aku.”","When Kakuhihewa heard these words of Lonoikamakahiki he, as well as those with him, was surprised and therefore asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion, saying: “Do you two know that the ahi of Hawaii wear wreaths of lehua and hala?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “The king of Hawaii is deceiving us. Make another wager.”"
"A ma keia olelo, alaila kahea aku la o Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Hawaii e! E pili. Mai ka lae o Kaoio a Mokapu, mau i ko wahi pohaku lana.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua mau.” A holo ka laua olelo, alaila, hoohuli muku ae la na waa o Lonoikamakahiki, a kamakamaka ae la i ka ia a paa, alaila, hoikeike ae la i ka lei lehua a me ka lei hala i mua o Kakuhihewa ma, a eo ae la o Kakuhihewa.","In obedience to this Kakuhihewa therefore called out: “Say, King of Hawaii, let us make a wager. From the Kaoio point to Mokapu I will place against your mooring rock.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “It is a bet.” As soon as the bet was made the stern of the double canoe of Lonoikamakahiki was turned toward the double canoe of Kakuhihewa, the fish was then made fast and Lonoikamakahiki showed the wreaths to Kakuhihewa, so that he was beaten."
"Mahope iho o keia eo ana o Kakuhihewa, olelo aku la o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa: “Eo ae la kakou ma keia mau mea, a aneane pau loa o Oahu nei.

Now, therefore, we had better do this: let us wager the rest of the island, from Mokapu to Leahi, as against the mooring rock, and let us have a canoe race. The canoe that will reach dry land first shall be the winner. If the king of Hawaii should agree to this then we will surely win, because he has but two rowers.”"
"A no keia olelo a Lanahuimihaku ma, olelo aku la o Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Hawaii, hoopauia aku kou aina i puni.” I mai o Lonoikamakahiki: “E aha kaua?” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “E heihei waa kakou, aia no hoi o na waa e kau e i ka maloo, nana ke eo; o kahi no hoi i koe a mau i ko wahi pohaku lana.” I aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua mau.” [ ] Mahope iho o ka laua pili ana, kena aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kakuhihewa: “Holo e aku mamua.” A lohe o Lanahuimihaku ma i keia huaolelo kena a Lonoikamakahiki, i aku la ia Kakuhihewa, me ka hoolale koke aku o Lanahuimihaku ma ia Kakuhihewa e olelo aku i na hoe waa e hoe.

Let the double canoe that will reach dry land first be the winner, and let that portion of the island of Oahu that is left be placed against your mooring rock.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “It is a bet.” After the bets had been made, Lonoikamakahiki said to Kakuhihewa: “You had better go on ahead.” When Lanahuimihaku and his companion heard Lonoikamakahiki ask of Kakuhihewa to proceed on ahead, they urged Kakuhihewa to order the rowers to go ahead. The order was therefore given and they started off."
"A hala aku la ko Kakuhihewa ma mau waa; alaila, kena aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i kona mau hoe waa e paina; alaila, paina lakou.

The men then took some food. By this time Kakuhihewa and his companions were almost out of sight. When they finished their meal Lonoikamakahiki ordered his rowers, Kaiehu and Kapahi, to row away. At the order the men began to row, taking the Koolauloa way and by way of Kona and then on in toward Waimanalo. After going for some time Kakuhihewa and his men laid to and awaited for the approach of Lonoikamakahiki, thinking that when they came up nearer they would then make land."
"Ia manawa a lakou e kali la, aia nae o Lonoikamakahiki e holo mai ana maloko o Waimanalo, a hiki ae i Kailua.

When Lonoikamakahiki and his men were about to get to the landing place Kakuhihewa for the first time caught sight of them, so he said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “I want you two to look and see what double canoe that is that is entering the landing place.” Lanahuimihaku and his companion then looked and said: “That canoe is Lonoikamakahiki’s. We are beaten.” Kakuhihewa then said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Where did they come from?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “They must have come by way of Koolau, then by way of Waianae and Kona.” Kakuhihewa said: “I thought you said that we were to win this race; but here it is we are beaten. You two are indeed strange. Here the whole of the island is gone, all through your advice, which I have always obeyed. Now my kingdom is lost to Lonoikamakahiki.” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “We were made bold to make a request for a canoe race with the king of Hawaii because we saw we have sixteen rowers while the king of Hawaii has but two.” When Kakuhihewa lost this last wager he lost the whole of the island of Oahu to Lonoikamakahiki."
"Mahope iho o keia mau mea, pili aku la o Kakuhihewa i ke kaikamahine ana, e hoi ka aina iaia, ma ke konane nae.

The game they played, however, was the game of konane. Kakuhihewa was an expert at the game; in fact this was the one thing in which he excelled in all the games he had made a study of, and knowing this Kakuhihewa challenged Lonoikamakahiki. This challenge Lonoikamakahiki accepted. Lonoikamakahiki, on the other hand, was not an expert in the game of konane, for the only time he played the game was when they were staying at Kalaupapa, where he played with his cousin, his wife."
"Hoomaka ae la na pili a laua a pau, alaila, kau na iliili apau, olelo aku o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kakuhihewa: “O kau lawe mua.” Nolaila, lawe ae la o Kakuhihewa i ka iliili mua, a lawe o Lonoikamakahiki, kui mai la o Kakuhihewa, a holo aku o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kakuhihewa: “O kau lawe mua.” Nolaila, lawe ae la o Kakuhihewa i ka iliili mua, a lawe o Lonoikamakahiki, kui mai la o Kakuhihewa, a holo aku o Lonoikamakahiki, a holo pu me Kakuhihewa, alaila lilo ka hauna hope ia Lonoikamakahiki.

Lonoikamakahiki then said to Kakuhihewa: “You make the first move.” Kakuhihewa therefore made the first move, and Lonoikamakahiki followed with the next. Kakuhihewa made [ ] another move, and Lonoikamakahiki made his. Kakuhihewa made several moves and so did Lonoikamakahiki. After this Lonoikamakahiki had his own way with the game. Of course Kakuhihewa was beaten in the first game, but since they had agreed before the start that two games must be won before the winner can claim the wager, the stones were again placed on the board and Lonoikamakahiki made the first move. In this second game Lonoikamakahiki proved to be the best player, and the game was almost won when it was stopped because of the arrival of Kaikilani at Kailua from Hawaii."
"A ike aku la na kanaka i na waa, nana aku la o Lonoikamakahiki, a ike aku la o Kaikilani keia, alaila, aole he makemake e ike aku i ko Kaikilani mau maka, a i mea e like ai me kona kanawai i kau ai i Molokai mahope iho o kona pepehi ana ia Kaikilani, nolaila, hoolilo loa iho la o Lonoikamakahiki i kona mau maka i ka papa konane, i ole ai oia e ike aku ia Kaikilani.","When the people saw a double canoe approaching they mentioned the fact and Lonoikamakahiki looked up and saw that it was Kaikilani, but not wanting to see her, in order to live up to the law laid down by him while in Molokai, after he had beaten Kaikilani, he therefore kept his face down onto the board so that he would not see her."
"A o Kaikilani hoi, iaia i pae mai ai iuka, hele aku la oia a ku mawaho o ka pa, ma ka paehumu hoi, ike aku la oia ia Lonoikamakahiki e konane ana, ua huli aku ke alo iloko o ka hale.

A penei kana kahea ana aku:","Kaikilani, on the other hand, when she came ashore approached the wall surrounding the house and on coming to the railing she saw Lonoikamakahiki playing konane, with his face turned toward the inside of the house. Upon seeing Lonoikamakahiki, Kaikilani recited the chant in his honor, similar to the one that appears in Chapter V. The chant was recited by her as follows:"
"Apau ka Kaikilani kahea ana mai i ka inoa o Lonoikamakahiki, alaila huli mai la o Lonoikamakahiki i hope, i nana aku ko ia nei hana, o ke kaikuahine keia ona e ku nei mawaho; ia manawa nui ae la ko Lonoikamakahiki aloha, aole nae e hiki ke hoomanawanui i kona uwe ana, aka, aole nae oia i uwe me ka leo, ma ke kulu o kona mau waimaka i ike ia ai kona uwe ana.","At the close of Kaikilani’s call or chant in honor of the name of Lonoikamakahiki he turned around and pretended as though it was the first time he had seen his cousin who had been standing outside of the enclosure. At sight of her, Lonoikamakahiki could scarcely contain himself, and his love for her was such that, try as he would, he could not withhold his tears; he was, however, able to refrain from crying out aloud."
"A no ke kahea ana mai o ke kaikuahine i ko Lonoikamakahiki inoa, alaila nana pono aku la ua o Lonoikamakahiki ia Lanahuimihaku ma, no ka mea, ua makemake oia e hana aku i ko Kaikilani inoa, aka, aole he loaa, a oia ko Lonoikamakahiki mea i nana pono aku ai ia Lanahuimihaku ma, na mea i loaa ko Kaikilani inoa.

But Lanahuimihaku and his companion, however, did not wish to come to his assistance, for they were supporters of Kakuhihewa."
"Ia manawa, loaa ae la ia Lonoikamakahiki na lalani mua eha o ko Kaikilani inoa, a huipu ae la me na lalani mele apo wale a ua o Lonoikamakahiki, alaila haliu aku la a kahea aku la i ka inoa o ke kaikuahine ma ke mele penei:","After a time, however, the first four lines of Kaikilani’s chant came to his memory, and together with a few lines which he picked up Lonoikamakahiki chanted the following response to the chant in his honor:"
"Kuu pali lehua i Kilou, Kuu aina lehua i lalo-e, Kuu kanaka lehua i ka pali, Lehua o kuu aina. E i ae oe ia lakou la He keikunane wau nou. Ae—. Ae—. Ae—. A kela puu wau, A keia puu au, Lumilumi i kou aahu. Nana mai ka pali lehua Owau e lehei aku ana.","My cliff of lehua at Kilou, My land of lehua there below, My man of lehua on the cliff, Lehua of my land. You must tell the others That I am your cousin. Yes—. Yes—. Yes—. I was at that hill, I was at this hill, Muss up your apparel. The cliff of lehua looked on As I was jumping down."
"A lohe o Kakuhihewa i ka hana a Lonoikamakahiki i ka inoa o ke kaikuahine, i mai la ua o Kakuhihewa: “Aia o ua o Lonoikamakahiki, ke hana ala i ko hai inoa, aole i hana mai i kona inoa.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua hana hoi; kai noa e hana aku ana, e uwe ae hoi me ka malihini.” [ ]","When Kakuhihewa heard Lonoikamakahiki’s response to the name of his cousin, Kakuhihewa remarked: “Lonoikamakahiki is chanting somebody else’s name instead of his own.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “It is done. I am going to recite it, but I must first weep with the stranger.” [ ]"
"Ia manawa, hele mai la o Kaikilani a honi i ka ihu o Lonoikamakahiki, a uwe iho la. A no ka hoolale pinepine mai o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki e hana i ka inoa o ua o Lonoikamakahiki, alaila, ninau aku la o Kaikilani ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Heaha kela a lakou la e olelo pinepine mai nei ia oe e hana ae?” I aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “E olelo mai ana lakou la ia’u e hana wau i kuu inoa, no ka mea, ua olelo o Lanahuimihaku ma, he alii inoa ole au.” I aku o Kaikilani: “Uoki ka uwe a kaua, hana ia aku ka lakou la koi.” Alaila, haliu aku la o Lonoikamakahiki a kahea aku la imua o ka aha i kona inoa, a hana pu aku la no hoi me Kaikilani. Oia kela mele maluna ae.","Kaikilani then came in and kissed Lonoikamakahiki and they wept. Seeing that Kakuhihewa was constantly urging Lonoikamakahiki to chant the name of Lonoikamakahiki, she asked of Lonoikamakahiki: “What is it that they are constantly urging you to do?” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “They are telling me to chant my name, because Lanahuimihaku and his companion have said that I am a chief without a chant in honor of my name.” Kaikilani then said: “Let us cease weeping and do as they request.” Lonoikamakahiki then faced about and recited to the people the chant in honor of his name, while Kaikilani joined him. The chant is the one already related above."
"A pau ka Lonoikamakahiki ma hana ana i ua inoa nei ona, alaila, olelo aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “He oi olua o na kanaka lapuwale nui wale. No’u paha auanei ka noho a lilo ia’u keia moku o Oahu nei, koli ola ia olua e a’u.”","At the close of the chant by Lonoikamakahiki and Kaikilani, Lonoikamakahiki then said to Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “You two men are the worst of any I have known. If during my visit here I shall get a hold of this island of Oahu, I will cut you to pieces while alive. ”"
"O ka hoopapa ana a ke alii o Oahu me ke alii o Hawaii, i olelo ia ma keia mokuna, o keia ka laua hoopapa hope loa, a hoi pu aku la o Lonoikamakahiki me Kaikilani i Hawaii.","The dispute between the king of Oahu and the king of Hawaii which ended in a contest, spoken of in this chapter, was the last one engaged in by the two, after which Lonoikamakahiki and Kaikilani returned together to Hawaii."
"O ke kumu o keia hoopapa, no Hauna wale no; no ka mea, mahope iho o ka lilo ana o Oahu ia Lonoikamakahiki ma na pili mua ana, ua noi mai o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki, e hoihoi hou o Oahu iaia; a penei ka Kakuhihewa olelo: “E ke alii o Hawaii, e aho e hoihoi ka aina ia’u, a e hoopau kela pili mua, ame kela eo mua ana. E noonoo hou mai oe i kumu hoopapa hou na kaua, a ina e eo wau ma ke kumu hoopapa hope, alaila, lilo pau loa o Oahu nei ia oe, mai kanaka nui a kanaka liilii.”","The cause of this dispute was entirely about Hauna. It came about in this wise: After Lonoikamakahiki had acquired Oahu through their former contests, Kakuhihewa begged of Lonoikamakahiki to restore to him the island of Oahu, going about it in a way as though he still owned the island, saying: “Say, King of Hawaii, I think you had better restore back to me the lands you have won and let our former wagers be done away with. I think you ought to propose another contest between us, and in case you should beat me in the new contest then the whole of Oahu shall be yours, including the men of high rank and those of the low rank.”"
"O keia olelo ana a Kakuhihewa pela, no Lanahuimihaku ma, no ka mea, ua olelo o Lonoikamakahiki, e koli ola ia Lanahuimihaku ma. A oia wale no ke kumu i olelo aku ai ua o Lanahuimihaku ia Kakuhihewa, e noi aku ia Lonoikamakahiki e imi hou i kumu hoopapa; aka, aole nae o Lonoikamakahiki i hai aku i kumu hoopapa na laua.","This request for a new contest, made by Kakuhihewa, was really the wish of Lanahuimihaku and his companion, for they had heard the remark made by Lonoikamakahiki that they would be put to death by being cut to pieces. This is the reason why Lanahuimihaku and his companion had urged Kakuhihewa to beg of Lonoikamakahiki for a new contest. To this request made by Kakuhihewa, Lonoikamakahiki did not give a subject for their contest."
"Aka, mahope koke iho oia wa no, lawe ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i kona hokeo a ku imua o kona alo, a olelo aku la ia Kakuhihewa: “E ke alii o Oahu nei, o keia hokeo la, ua piha i ka iwi o na ’lii i make i ke kaua i luna o Puumaneo, no ka mea, eono alii aimoku i make i ke kaua a kuu makuakane e waiho nei i loko o ka hokeo.” [ ]","Shortly after this, however, Lonoikamakahiki took up his calabash, which contained his personal effects as well as other things, and placed it in front of him, and then said to Kakuhihewa: “Say, King of Oahu, this calabash is filled with the bones of the chiefs who were killed in the battle on the top of Puumaneo, because there were six district chiefs that were slain by my father and their bones are in this calabash.” [ ]"
"Olelo aku la o Kakuhihewa: “Wahahee wale! Owai kai ao mai ia oe, he pau na ’lii eono iloko o na hokeo?” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Owau no. Aia apopo hiki mai kuu makuakane o Hauna, nana e hai aku ia oukou.” I aku o Kakuhihewa: “A nawai mai nei hoi na olelo au e puka mai ana o Hauna i ka la apopo?” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Na’u no, a na kuu ike.” Ia manawa ninau ae la o Kakuhihewa ia Lanahuimihaku ma: “Ea, he oiaio anei kela a ke alii o Hawaii e olelo mai la, he ike kona; a e hiki io mai ana anei o Hauna i ka la apopo?” I aku o Lanahuimihaku: “He wahahee, nawai kona ike; o maua no paha kona mau kanaka ike, mai kona makuakane mai, a o ua o Hauna e noho mai la i Hawaii; a o ke kahu no ona i pepehi ai ia kakou i kai, pau ae la no na kanaka ike; a o ua alii la ea he ole loa.” I hou aku o Kakuhihewa: “He oiaio, e puka mai ana anei o Hauna i ka la apopo?” I aku ua o Lanahuimihaku ma: “He wahahee. Piliia aku.”","Kakuhihewa upon hearing this said: “How you deceive! Who has taught you that that calabash could ever hold the bones of six chiefs?” Lonoikamakahiki said: “I say it. Tomorrow my foster-father Hauna will arrive and he will tell you people about the matter.” Kakuhihewa then said to him: “And who has brought you word that Hauna is to arrive tomorrow?” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “I, myself, say so because of my knowledge.” Kakuhihewa then asked of Lanahuimihaku and his companion: “Say, are the words spoken by the king of Hawaii true, that he can see the future and that Hauna is to arrive tomorrow?” Lanahuimihaku replied: “It is a lie; he has no knowledge of the future. We were the two men who were able to tell him of the future from the time of his father, and this Hauna, who is living on Hawaii, and the attendant whom he killed when we were out fishing were the only men who could tell of the future; but the king there knows nothing at all about the matter.” Kakuhihewa then again asked: “Is it true that Hauna is going to arrive here tomorrow?” Lanahuimihaku and his companion replied: “It is not true. Make a wager with him.”"
"I aku o Kakuhihewa ia Lonoikamakahiki: “E ke alii o Hawaii-e. He nani ia ua loaa ae la ka kaua kumu hoopapa o Hauna, o kona hiki mai i ka la apopo.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Auhea kau kumu e pili ai? I ku hoi nei mea o ka pili i ka loaa o ke kumu e pili mai ai.” I mai o Kakuhihewa: “Kai noa no hoi o Oahu nei no a mau ia Hawaii?” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Aia ka a lilo o Oahu nei ia’u, pili mai no?” I hou mai o Kakuhihewa: “Alia hoi ia manao ou e ke alii o Hawaii. Kai noa o Oahu iki ka kaua i pili iho nei, koe no o Oahu nui?” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua pono. Ma na moku okana nae ka pili, eono moku o Oahu nei, eono no hoi o Hawaii.” A holo ae la ka laua olelo, ia po iho hiki ae la o Hauna i Kailua, a ao ae, hai aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kakuhihewa: “Ua hiki ae la o Hauna eia i Oahu nei.”","Kakuhihewa then said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Say, King of Hawaii, since we have at last found a subject for another contest—the matter of the arrival of Hauna tomorrow—let us, therefore, have one.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “What have you to offer as your wager? A good contest can only be made when one has something to place as a wager.” Kakuhihewa said: “Why not let Oahu be offered as against Hawaii?” Lonoikamakahiki made answer: “When you know that I have already won Oahu you come and again offer it for a wager.” Kakuhihewa said: “You must put away such thoughts, King of Hawaii. It was the small Oahu that we wagered before, and large Oahu is still my own.” Lonoikamakahiki then replied: “It is well, then. The stakes are the island districts. Oahu containing six districts and Hawaii also containing six.” After this bet was made and agreed on, that night Hauna arrived in Kailua, and so the next morning Lonoikamakahiki said to Kakuhihewa: “Hauna has arrived on Oahu.”"
"A lohe o Kakuhihewa i keia olelo a Lonoikamakahiki, alaila, kena ae la oia i kana elele ia Kuleonui, he kanaka kaulana oia i ka mama, a olelo aku la: “E hele oe e nana a puni o Oahu nei, a ina i ike oe ia Hauna, alaila e pepehi iho, a hao ae i ka waiwai, i eo ke alii o Hawaii ia kakou.” Alaila holo ae la o Kuleonui a puni o Oahu nei; aole i loaa o Hauna. Hoi aku la, a olelo aku la ia Kakuhihewa: “Hele aku nei wau a puni o Oahu nei, aole i loaa o Hauna, aole no i puka mai, aole he waa holo mai ma ka moana, aole no hoi he waa hekau i ke kai, aole he waa kau i uka, he ole loa no.” Ia manawa i manao ai o Kakuhihewa, e eo ana o Lonoikamakahiki. Alaila, hele aku la o Kakuhihewa a olelo aku ia Lonoikamakahiki, me ka ninau aku: “Ua hiki mai nei anei o Hauna?” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua hiki ae la.”","When Kakuhihewa heard these words from Lonoikamakahiki, he sent out his messenger, Kuleonui, a man famous for being a very fast runner, and told him: “You must go around Oahu and look for Hauna. When you find him, kill him, and seize all his property, so that we may be able to defeat the king of Hawaii.” At this Kuleonui started on his trip around the island of Oahu; but he was unable to find Hauna. He therefore returned and reported to Kakuhihewa, saying: “I have made a circuit of Oahu but was unable to find Hauna. He has not arrived even, nor is there a canoe to be seen at sea coming this way, nor is there one hauled up on the shore; none at all.” At this Kakuhihewa began to think that he would beat Lonoikamakahiki. Kakuhihewa then went to Lonoikamakahiki and again asked him: “Has Hauna arrived?” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “He has arrived.”"
"Lohe ae la no o Kakuhihewa i keia olelo a Lonoikamakahiki, kena hou aku la no ia Kuleonui, e holo a puni o Oahu. Alaila, holo hou aku la no, a hoi aku la, hai aku la i ke alii, me ka hoole aku: “Aole i loaa, aole no i hiki mai.” E like no me kana olelo mua. [ ]","When Kakuhihewa heard this from Lonoikamakahiki, he again sent Kuleonui to make another circuit of Oahu. Again Kuleonui started out and returned to the king to whom he reported, saying: “I have not found him. He has not even arrived,” repeating what he said at the other time. [ ]"
"Aka, ma ke kaapuni mua ana a Kuleonui i ua la la, ua hiki mua ae o Hauna ma Kailua, e konane ana me na wahine; ike aku nae o Hauna ia Kuleonui e holo ana, me ka alawa o na maka, mao a mao, i ike aku ai oia i kona mea i hoounaia mai ai, aole nae oia i ike aku ia Hauna, aka, o Hauna kai ike mua aku ia Kuleonui, a nolaila oia i pee ai, a pakele aku la i na maka o ka elele a Kakuhihewa.","But, on the first circuit made by Kuleonui on that day, Hauna had already arrived in Kailua and was playing konane with a couple of women when Kuleonui came by, and was recognized by Hauna as a person out looking for some one, by the way he was glancing around. By this, Hauna knew that Kuleonui was a messenger and was able to conceal his identity and was in this way missed by the sharp eyes of the messenger of Kakuhihewa."
"Ia Hauna e noho ana i Hawaii, manao ae la oia e imi mai ia Lonoikamakahiki, a nolaila, hoomakaukau ae la oia i na ukana a pau e hooili maluna o kona mau waa. A ka ukana nui o luna o na waa o Hauna, he ahuula. Ua hoopihaia na waa mai mua a hope i ka ahuula, a oia hookahi no ka ukana.","While Hauna was living on Hawaii he thought he would come in search of Lonoikamakahiki, so he therefore made ready his personal effects and placed them in his canoes. The chief articles of value that Hauna placed on the canoes, however, were a large number of feather cloaks. The canoes were loaded from stem to stern with these articles. These were the only things in the canoes."
"Ia holo ana mai mai Hawaii mai a kau ma Kailua, ike aku la oia e konane ana elua wahine me ka laua mau kane. Ia ike ana aku a Hauna, ua honu ka papa konane, alaila, i aku o Hauna: “Ua make olua, ina owau ko olua hoa konane, make olua ia’u.” I mai ua mau wahine la: “Eia mai no hoi ka papa konane, konane mai.” I aku o Hauna: “Alia kakou e konane, aia a hala aku ka elele a Kakuhihewa, alaila, konane kakou; e pono nae ke uhi i ke kapa ka papa konane, alaila, olelo ka pili mamua, a holo, alaila konane.”","On this voyage from Hawaii he made land at Kailua, where he saw a couple of women playing konane with their husbands. When Hauna saw the game he knew at once by the position of the stones that the men were beaten, so he said to the women: “You two are beaten, providing I was to play you women. I know I can beat you two.” The women replied: “Here is the konane board, go ahead and play.” Hauna said: “Let us delay the game for a while until the messenger of Kakuhihewa passes by; after he passes we will continue with the game. We must, however, cover up the board with a piece of kapa; after that we can discuss as to our wagers, and when that is settled we will begin.”"
"A hala aku la o Kuleonui, olelo ae la lakou no ka pili, a hooholo ae la lakou. A penei ka pili ana. Olelo mai na wahine ia Hauna: “Aole a maua kumu e ae e pili aku ai, o na kino wale no o maua, a ina no hoi ua make maua ia oe ma ka hauna o ka papa mua, alaila, lilo no hoi maua nau.” I aku la o Hauna: “He mau waa kaulua ko’u elua, ua piha i ka waiwai; o ka waiwai nui nae o luna, he ahuula, a ina i make wau ia olua, no olua ka waa ame ka ukana o luna apau, a me na kanaka pu o luna.” I mai la na wahine: “Ua mau.” Olelo aku la o Hauna: “Ia’u ka uhau mua i koe.”","After Kuleonui had passed the place the bet was discussed and agreed on in the following manner: the women said to Hauna: “We have nothing to offer on our side excepting ourselves. If you beat us in this present unfinished game you can take us as your property.” Hauna then said: “I have two double canoes filled with things that are valuable; the chief articles of value on the canoes, however, are a large number of feather cloaks. If you two beat me, you two shall have the goods in the canoes together with the men on board.” The women replied: “It is a bet.” Hauna then said: “Let me make the first move.”"
"He oiaio, ma ko lakou hahau mua ana, mamua o ko lakou pili ana, a me ka uhi ana i ke kapa, ua maopopo ia Hauna e make ana oia; aka, no ka ike ana aku ia Kuleonui, nolaila, oia i olelo ai, alia e uhau a hala aku ka elele a Kakuhihewa, e uhi ia ka papa i ke kapa. Aka i ka hoomaka ana e lawe ae i ke kapa, lilo pu ae la me ka iliili a na wahine i ike ai he maikai, ma ka lima o Hauna. Alaila, hahau ae la o Hauna, a make iho la na wahine. I aku la o Hauna: “Ua lilo olua ia’u.” I aku ua mau wahine nei: “He mau kane ka maua, pehea la auanei maua e pono ai?” I aku na kane: “Aole a olua olelo kuhikuhi no maua, no ka mea, ua lilo olua.” Alaila kahea ae la na kane a ua mau wahine la ia Hauna: “Lawe ia na wahine nau, ua eo ia oe, no ka mea, aole na hai aku ka laua mea i pili ai, na laua no.” [ ]","It was a fact that before the game was continued, and before the bets were settled and the board covered with the piece of kapa, Hauna knew very well that he was beaten; but upon seeing Kuleonui it gave him an excuse to propose that the board be covered over until the messenger of Kakuhihewa passed by. According to his request the board was covered over. But when the kapa was removed, in order to continue the game, Hauna caught up some of the stones which gave the women the best advantage with the kapa. Hauna then made the first move and after a few more moves the women were beaten. At this he said: “I have won you two.” The women replied: “We have husbands of our own and we cannot see how we can straighten out this difficulty.” The husbands of the two women replied: “You two had better not consider us, because you made your own bet and have lost it yourselves.” The husbands then said to Hauna: “You can take the women as your own property, for you have won them; they were not staked by others; they made the bet themselves.” [ ]"
"A no ia mea, lalau aku la o Hauna i na wahine a nakii ae la i ka malo i kekahi wahine ame kekahi wahine, a kauo aku la i kahi a na waa e kau ana. A no ia kauo ana o Hauna i na wahine, nolaila, ua kapaia ka inoa o kela wahi o Kaohao, ma Kailua, Koolaupoko, Oahu, a hiki mai i keia la.","Because of this Hauna took the women and tied them together with a loin cloth and led them to the place where the canoes were lying. Because these women were led by Hauna, the place where this act took place was given the name of Kaohao and it so remains to this day. The place is in Kailua, Koolaupoko, Oahu."
"Hele pu aku la ua mau wahine nei me Hauna a hiki i na waa, olelo aku la i kekahi wahine: “Eia kou waa a me na ukana o luna mai mua a hope, a eia kou mau kanaka, he mau kanaka lawelawe nou; aole he mau kanaka moe aku nau.” A e like me ka olelo i kela wahine, pela no ka ia nei olelo ana i ka lua o ka wahine. A haalele iho la oia i na wahine, a hele aku la e halawai me Lonoikamakahiki.","The women were taken by Hauna to the canoes where he said to one of them: “This canoe shall be yours with everything in it from stem to stern, including the men. The men shall be your servants; they are not for you to sleep with. ” And as he had spoken to her, so in like manner he spoke to the second woman. He then left the women and proceeded to meet Lonoikamakahiki."
"A hiki aku la o Hauna a halawai me Lonoikamakahiki, i aku la o Lonoikamakahiki: “Ina e hiki ole mai nei oe i keia la, o ka pau no ia o’u i kalua, eia la ua makaukau ka umu no’u.” I aku o Hauna: “Ua eo ia oe, hoike ia aku na iwi o na ’lii i make i ke kaua i ka wa o ko makuakane o Keawenuiaumi.”","When Hauna went up to meet Lonoikamakahiki, Lonoikamakahiki said to him: “If you had not arrived this day I would have been cooked in the umu, for it is now ready.” Hauna replied: “You have won. Show them the bones of the chiefs killed in the battle in the time of your father, Keawenuiaumi. ”"
"Ia manawa, lalau ae la o Hauna i na iwi o ko Kohala alii, ua hakuia i ka hulu, ua kamaahaia a paa, a olelo aku la ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Eia keia alii o Palahalaha, ko Kohala alii, ka Wohilani keiki.

He had been residing with us, and seeing how few we were, left, and at your father’s battle on Puumaneo died at our hands. We secured the bones and put them away in the gourd container.” At this time Lonoikamakahiki seized them and threw them in front of Kakuhihewa and began chanting:"
"Palahalaha wale Ka moe a Kohala, I lalo ke alo. Ehuehu mai ana ia’u, Ka pua o Koolau, o Moolau. Kai mai ana ka waiho a Puakea, Kakaako ana Kukuipahu.

He resided with Keawenuiaumi, and seeing how few we were, left, and at the battle of Keawenuiaumi on Puumaneo we slew him. He was also a younger brother (cousin) of Keawenuiaumi. Kohala is a beautiful country and is a large district.” [ ]"

He lived with us, and having learnt that we were few in number, deserted, and at our battle at Puumaneo he was slain by Keawenuiaumi.

He lived with us, and ascertaining how few we were, went away, and at the battle fought on Puumaneo was slain by Keawenuiaumi. His bones were stripped, put away in the container, and this is he.” [ ]"

Lanahuimihaku and the others answered: “This is Lililehua, the chief of Puna, the child of Hua-a. He had a beautiful country where even the pandanus and the lehua enter the sea, being the only sweet-scented land on Hawaii. This chief had his home with us; a younger brother (cousin) of Keawenuiaumi, but knowing our numerical weakness, deserted us, and at the battle fought on Puumaneo we slew him, stripped all his bones, put them in a container, and this is he.”"

He is also an uncle (father) of yours and a younger cousin (brother) of Keawenuiaumi. He also lived with us, and seeing how few we were, deserted, and at the battle of Puumaneo was slain by Keawenuiaumi. We secured his bones and put them away in the gourd.”"
"Alaila, lawe ae la o Lonoikamakahiki a paa ma ka lima, alaila oli aku la:","Lonoikamakahiki, holding the bones in his hands, chanted:"

He was also a younger brother (cousin) of your father. He lived with us, and because we were few, deserted and went elsewhere; he rebelled against Keawenuiaumi, and at your father’s battle on Puumaneo was also slain, the bones stripped and put into the gourd.”"
"Alaila, lawe ae la o Lonoikamakahiki a paa ma ka lima, a oli aku la:","Lonoikamakahiki, holding the bones in his hands, chanted thus:"

They answered: “This is Moihala, the chief of Kona, a large division of Hawaii. Moihala was also a younger brother (cousin) of Keawenuiaumi. He resided with us, and finding out how few we were, left, went to the opposite side, a rebel. He thought by rebelling he would be safe, but when putting in an appearance at our battle at Puumaneo he was slain by Keawenuiaumi.”"
"Ma keia hoike hope ana a Lonoikamakahiki i ko Kona alii, o ka pau loa no hoi ia o Oahu nei ia Lonoikamakahiki.

Following this incident, Lonoikamakahiki spoke to Kaikilani: “Inasmuch as we have made the circuit of Oahu, you, of us, had better remain; it is good land, with inhabitants both large and small.” Kaikilani answered: “It is agreeable to me; but we had better go to put Hawaii on a satisfactory basis, then return again to Oahu. There are the chiefs of Hawaii; they have rebelled and have confiscated everything. As for yourself, upon arriving at Hawaii, wage battle, as the men have been thickly arrayed from Anaehoomalu to the front of Kauhola.”"
"A no keia olelo ana aku a Kaikilani pela, hoolale koke ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i na waa, a holo aku la lakou.

Upon arrival there with his men, the chiefs of Kona and the men were all at Kohala awaiting the arrival of Lonoikamakahiki there to be slaughtered by them. Upon Lonoikamakahiki’s arrival he sent a messenger to Kau to get Pupuakea to come to meet his elder brother (Lonoikamakahiki) to consult concerning putting to an end the rebellious chiefs of Hawaii.

Pupuakea then sent a messenger calling upon all the men to come to do battle. Kau was the only district which had not rebelled, because Pupuakea took up his residence there after Lonoikamakahiki departed for Oahu. The men having been informed, came over by the upper part of Kau to upper Kona, but the messenger that was sent reached Kealakekua, where Lonoikamakahiki and Pupuakea were living. After receiving the information that the men had come overland, Lonoikamakahiki and Pupuakea went to intercept them at Puuanahulu , and that was the place where the men were arrayed in battle formation. About this time, however, the rebels who were down at Anaehoomalu observed that the clinkers at Puuanahulu were red with people, which was a matter of surprise to the rebels. Some of them thought there was a battle being fought, while others conjectured they were some of their own men, being under the impression that Lonoikamakahiki was still at Oahu, for no news had been received that he, Lonoikamakahiki, had arrived at Kealakekua."

On the night the men left Puuanahulu to go down, the rebels realized there was to be war, because there were in the hands of the men torches burning from the van to the rear of the war procession of Lonoikamakahiki. Then it was that the rebels made preparations for battle, sending out messengers to inform the men and the chiefs on their side that had been stationed from Anaehoomalu to distant Kohala."
"Aka ia Lonoikamakahiki ma i iho mai ai, halawai mua iho la me na kipi i Wailea, a o ka hoouka koke iho la no ia o ke kaua, a pau iho la na kipi i ka lukuia, a lanakila ae la o Lonoikamakahiki ma ia hoouka kaua ana.

Lonoikamakahiki was victorious on this occasion and the rebels were annihilated. This was the battle fought by Lonoikamakahiki, where it is said that blood flowed like water at Wainanalii, and hence the battle is described as that of Kaheawai."
"Mahope iho o ke kaua a Lonoikamakahiki i Kaheawai, ma ke kakahiaka nui, ike ia mai la o Lonoikamakahiki e ka aoao kipi e hele aku ana i ke a o Kaniku, alaila, hoi aku la na kanaka o ka aoao kipi a hai aku la i ko lakou pukaua (Alihikaua) ia Kanaloapulehu, me ka i aku: “Eia’e o Lonoikamakahiki me Pupuakea ma, ua pau mai nei kekahi poe i ka make ua hee mai nei kakou (na kipi).”","Early in the morning after the battle of Lonoikamakahiki at Kaheawai, he was observed by the rebels proceeding along the lava bed of Kaniku. The rebels after returning to camp reported to their general, Kanaloapulehu, saying: “Lonoikamakahiki and Pupuakea are approaching, some men have been slain, and we (the rebels) have been routed.”"
"Nolaila, olelo ae la o Kanaloapulehu ia Kanaloakuakawaiea ko Hilo alii: “Ho aku ke kaua i Kaunooa i ke one nui, i hoouka ai ke kaua ilaila, i hiki ae ai ia o Lonoikamakahiki ilaila, ua paa mua ia kakou ke one, na lakou ia e hele ae, kanu mai ke one i na maka, lilo lakou ilaila e anaanai ai hao aku na pohaku, o ka lanakila no ia.”","Kanaloapulehu commanded Kanaloakuakawaiea, the chief of Hilo: “Let the battle be at Kaunooa where there is plenty of sand, and let it be fought there, so that when Lonoikamakahiki reaches the spot we would be in possession of the sand, so that whilst rubbing their eyes the rocks will fly and victory will be ours.”"
"E like me ka olelo a Kanaloapulehu ia Kanaloakuakawaiea, alaila, laweia aku la na kanaka o ka aoao kipi a hoonoho ma Kaunooa (aia no kela wahi mawaena o Puako a me Kawaihae).

This is a place midway between Puako and Kawaihae. At the noon hour Lonoikamakahiki came in contact with the rebels and the battle commenced in earnest and he was victorious over them, having repulsed Kanaloapulehu and his followers just as the shades of evening were falling. [ ]"
"Ia Kanaloapulehu ma i hee aku ai me na kipi, loaa aku la ko Kohala poe kipi mai a me ko Hamakua mai ma kahi i kapaia o Nakikiaianihau.

Kanaloapulehu commanded them, saying: “Let us go back and encamp at Haleokapuni, and let some of us go on to Puukohola, and when Lonoikamakahiki is seen approaching Nakikiaianihau, then we will occupy Puukohola so we can shower rocks from above and Lonoikamakahiki’s battle will be a defeat.” All the chiefs observed the commands of the general and encamped at Haleokapuni immediately below the temple of Puukohola and Mailekini at Kawaihae. Lonoikamakahiki, however, did not manoeuver as was anticipated by the rebels."
"Mahope iho o ko Lonoikamakahiki lanakila ana i ke kaua ma Kaunooa, alaila, ninau ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i kana mau kahuna i kahi e hiki ai ke hele a lanakila.

The priests directed him to proceed by way of Pili until they came to Puupa, “and there a big battle should be fought, because thus far we have only fought against the Konas, and know nothing about Hilo and Puna, nor of Hamakua. Pay no heed to Kohala, it is a small district; let us fight her last. Proceed against the triplets, Puna, Hilo and Hamakua.”"
"Ia pii ana a Lonoikamakahiki ma mai Kaunooa aku, a waena pili, ma ke aumoe, ike aku la lakou i ke ahi a na kipi e a mai ana i Puupa.

Proceeding upwards from Kaunooa and about midway of the plains at about midnight they could see the fires of the rebels at Puupa. Lonoikamakahiki asked his priests: “What is that fire?” The priests answered: “A battle. It is the fires of the traitors of the land.” He asked again: “What of us?” The kahunas answered: “Send along forty men with torches in their hands, each man to carry four torches to burn, so as to deceive and to give the rebels the impression that there are four forty men, allowing them to proceed directly and when immediately outside of Puupa permit them to light their torches so we may be able to locate the whereabouts of the enemy and learn where they are encamped, the battle to begin at once, we to follow them from the rear and the forty from the opposite direction, and the enemy will be routed.”"
"Ia manawa a ke kahuna i olelo ai, hoouna aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i hookahi kanaha kanaka me Pupuakea pu, oia ke kanaha kumamakahi.

They followed the instructions of the priests, each man carrying four torches, proceeding along the direction indicated by the priests. They travelled along to the outskirts of the camp of the rebels, lighted their four forty torches and set up a tremendous shouting, “Onto the traitors of the land! Onto the traitors of the land!” and such like."
"A ike ae la na kipi i na lama e a ana, a me na leo hooho, a helu aku la lakou (na kipi) i ka nui o na lama, pakahi, ua like me eha kanaha, a alualu aku la.

After first counting the number of torches and discovering there were only four forties the rebels gave chase. While the rebels were absent Lonoikamakahiki and his men arrived, and in the fight with Pupuakea’s men, who gained by repulsing the rebels, Lonoikamakahiki and his army stood off ready to receive them. The battle waxed fierce and hard until the two divisions of Lonoikamakahiki and Pupuakea came together, when there was great [ ] slaughter of the rebels. Some escaping, ran upwards to Ouli at Waimea that night and were there slain by their own men being under the impression that they were Lonoikamakahiki’s men running away. Thereby the remaining rebels who escaped from the battle of Puupa were also killed. It is for this reason that this fight of Lonoikamakahiki’s was called Puupa, and was the third of his battles."
"Ma ke ao ana ae, i kela po i hoouka kaua ai ma Puupa, kui aku la ka lono i na wahi e ae, aia o Lonoikamakahiki i Puupa; nolaila, o ka poe e hoomoana ana ma Haleokapuni i Kawaihae, a e like hoi me ka manao mua o ka poe e hoomoana ana ma Haleokapuni, aole lakou e pii iluna o Puukohola, aia a make kekahi kanaka o ko Lonoikamakahiki aoao, alaila pii ia o Puukohola no ka hai kanaka.

Those who were encamped at Haleokapuni in Kawaihae, in accordance with a previous understanding had by them, would not ascend Puukohola unless a man on the side of Lonoikamakahiki should be slain; then only would Puukohola be scaled for human sacrifices. For that reason the rebels rested with high hopes, based on their former understanding and anticipations of victory, because Kanaloapulehu and Kanaloakuakawaiea were celebrated for their great prowess."
"Aka ma kekahi po, hiki aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i Kawaihae me kona puali, a o ko Pupuakea puali hoi iho ia ae a ma Nakikiaianihau , hoaiai ia mai.

Paa iho la o Kanaloapulehu ia po a ao, pepehiia iho la, a kau ia aku la i ka lele. Pela i make ai ka pukaua o na kipi.","On the night following Lonoikamakahiki arrived at Kawaihae with his force of men, and Pupuakea’s force came by way of Nakikiaianihau , and revealed themselves. Kanaloapulehu, seeing the force of Pupuakea, sent out four hundred men to give him battle. At the same time that the men were on the way to intercept Pupuakea, Lonoikamakahiki had taken possession of Puukohola by a strategic move made during the night and was occupying the top of it. Immediately the battle commenced, and Kanaloapulehu was afterwards made prisoner by Lonoikamakahiki’s warriors, and Kanaloakuakawaiea was repulsed with what was remaining of the rebels, Lonoikamakahiki being the victor that night, recording the fourth night battle won by him. This battle of Lonoikamakahiki at Puukohola was named the Kawaluna, because of the night strategy successfully executed by him on that occasion. Kanaloapulehu, having been made prisoner, was killed and laid upon the altar (lele). So died the general of the rebels."
"Mahope iho o ka lanakila ana o Lonoikamakahiki i ka hoouka kaua ana ma Puukohola, hee aku la o Kanalaokuakawaiea, ka pukaua nui i koe o na kipi aina; hee aku la a noho i luna o Puainako. (Aia kela oioina ma ka akau ae o Kawaihae, aneane eha mile mai Kawaihae aku).","After the victory by Lonoikamakahiki at the battle of Puukohola and the repulse of Kanaloakuakawaiea, the remaining great general of the traitors was forced to the top of Puainako. That eminence is about four miles to the north of Kawaihae."
"Ma ua po hoouka kaua la i Puukohola, ma ke kakahiaka ana ae, mahope iho hoi o ka pau ana o ka hai kanaka (Kanaloapulehu) ma Puukohola, ia manawa hoomaka aku la ka Lonoikamakahiki poe kaua e hele; aka ua hiki mua aku la o Pupuakea me kana poe kaua i ka pali o Honokoa i ka manawa poeleele o ke kakahiaka nui, me ka manao e loaa aku ke pio, aka, aole he pio i loaa aku; nolaila hoi hope mai la ua o Pupuakea, a loaa o Lonoikamakahiki e iho mai ana i Pahonu, akahi no a hui na puali elua; ka Pupuakea me ka Lonoikamakahiki.

Pupuakea and his men, however, had already arrived at the precipice of Honokoa during the darkness of early morning with the intention of capturing prisoners, but none were captured, however. So Pupuakea returned and met Lonoikamakahiki descending at Pahonu. The two divisions of Pupuakea and Lonoikamakahiki were then brought together again. They then held a consultation as to the direction they should take. Pupuakea and Lonoikamakahiki desired to go by way of Waimea, but the wish of the priest, Hauna, was to proceed by the Kohala route to Puumaneo and there make preparation for battle. Lonoikamakahiki heeded the advice of the priest. [ ]"
"Ma ia hooholo ana, hele aku la lakou mai Kawaihae aku, a hiki i ka pali o Honokoa, a kau maluna o ka aoao ma Kohala; ia manawa, ike aku la o Lonoikamakahiki i ka meheu wawae o na kipi, alaila hoomaka hou aku la ka lanakila e huli i ka meheu, aia nae e ahu ana na meheu he nui, ua mae ke pili.

At that moment Lonoikamakahiki noticed the footprints of the rebels, and the victors began to search for more traces and they were innumerable, as indicated by the withered pili grass. Lonoikamakahiki’s forces followed the trodden path and lo! there were the rebels in large numbers encamped at Puainako. The rebels having first seen the forces of approaching men made their escape in every direction. However, before the final understanding had been reached at Puhaukole, Pupuakea already had dispatched a messenger to investigate the condition of the rebels who were repulsed at the battle of Puukohola."
"A ma keia ukali ana a Lonoikamakahiki ma, halawai mua mai la me ka elele i hoounaia aku ai. Olelo mai la ua elele la: “Aia ke pio ke auhee la i ke pili.” Nolaila, alualu aku la ka lanakila mahope o ke pio, halawai aku la lakou ma kahakai o Kahua, a luku aku la o Pupuakea i na kipi mai ke pili aku a hiki ma kahakai, auhee aku la, a puehu liilii aku la ma o a ma o.

The conquerors gave chase, meeting them on the beach at Kahua, when Pupuakea slaughtered them on the pili grass as well as at the beach, their repulse having scattered them in every direction. As for Kanaloakuakawaiea, he fled to the canoe landing and ordered the men to cover him with pebbles; the covering was only partial, however. Lonoikamakahiki and his men soon arrived upon the scene and Kanaloakuakawaiea was there slain."
"A ike mai la na kanaka o Hilo, ua make ko lakou alii, hoomake pu mai la na makaainana mamuli ona, a luku aku la ka lanakila a pau loa kekahi mau kipi, a o kekahi poe kipi, inana aku la lakou maluna o ke aa o na kahakai o Kahua, mehe opae la ka pohaku kahawai, a nolaila kahea mai o Pupuakea:","When the men of Hilo heard that their chief was killed, they also offered themselves to be slain with him. The victors slaughtered a large number of them. Some of them scrambled over the clinkers along the beach at Kahua, like shrimps clinging to the rocks in a stream. Then it was that Pupuakea chanted:"
"Ke hee la ka hoi e hee ai, Ke pio la ka hoi e pio ai, Ka ua pio kipi aina, Ke inana la ka hoi, Mehe opae oehaa la; I luna ke aa haoa E kala ka hee, Ua kaheawai ke kaua, Ke kaua kuehu one i Kaunooa, Ke kawa po i Puupa, I kaua huli moku i Kawaluna, Hee honua kipi aina I ka ehu makani o ka laau Hai kanaka nae hoi, Lono-e He lanakila-la Lanakila nae hoi Lono, E na ’lii hana ino o lakou-e!","Routed, are you, indeed you are routed! Beaten, are you, indeed you are beaten! You treasonable land pirates; You are scattered about, are you, Like water shrimps, Onto the rocks in the stream. You were routed sometime ago, For the battle was like a freshet, The battle in the shower of sand at Kaunooa, The night battle at Puupa. In the general war at Kawaluna The land pirates were easily defeated, Merely by the wind from the war clubs. Men are sacrificed indeed, by Lono. It was a victory. Lono was victorious, You treasonable chiefs!"
"Ua kapaia keia kaua a Lonoikamakahiki, Kaiopae, a nolaila, ua kapaia ka inoa o ia awa pae waa mamuli o ia kaua, a o kona inoa mau ia a hiki i keia la.","This battle of Lonoikamakahiki’s was called Kaiopae, and the landing place was named after this battle and is known as such to this day."
"Mahope iho o keia pio ana i ke kaua ma Kaiopae, hele aku la ka lanakila a hiki i Kohala. Ia lakou nae i hiki aku ai, e hoopaa mai ana ke kaua a na kipi i Hinakahua, ma Kapaau i Kohala.

Upon their arrival there the rebels were in a state of preparedness for war at Hinakahua, in Kapaau of Kohala. The rebels observed the victors approaching on the highlands [ ] in inferior numbers, and because of the enemy’s numerical weakness, mustered courage to give battle to the forces of Lonoikamakahiki; but upon the near approach of the conquerors the rebels fled without any apparent reason, slaughtering each other in their confusion, fleeing to hide themselves among the precipices of Pololu and Honokane."
"A Halelua, loaa aku la na kipi ilaila, a luku ia iho la e Pupuakea me kana laau palau. A make iho la ko Kohala pukaua o Kaiopihi, a lanakila ae la o Lonoikamakahiki ma ia kaua ana.

Kaiopihi, the Kohala general was slain, and Lonoikamakahiki once more was victorious at this battle. This battle of Lonoikamakahiki was named Kaiopihi after the incident of the death of Kaiopihi at that place, the locality being known by that name to this day."
"Mahope iho o keia kaua, hoi aku la o Lonoikamakahiki a noho mauka o Pololu, maluna o kela puu kaua i oleloia o Puumaneo, e like me ke kuhikuhi a Hauna, kona kahu a kahuna hoi.

While located on Puumaneo, reinforcements of rebels from Hamakua, Hilo, Puna and Kona arrived. Lonoikamakahiki gained a complete victory, and there it was that all the rebellious chiefs were slaughtered, not one escaping death. Thus Lonoikamakahiki came into control of the whole of Hawaii."
"Mahope iho o keia lanakila ana, hoi aku la o Lonoikamakahiki a kapu heiau iho la ma Apuakehau, Kohala, aia malaila ka heiau i oleloia o Muleiula.

After this dedication he proceeded and held another ceremony at Puukohola. Having performed his duties at this place he went on, and at Kahaluu, in Kona, again held a dedication service at the temple of Makolea. On the way Kapulani, a rebel chief, was caught hiding in the valley by the victors. It had been previously reported that he was one of the chiefs who rebelled against Lonoikamakahiki, and because of that fact Kapulani was condemned to die. On the night that the council was held the intention was to place him on the altar the following morning, but during the night he was assisted to escape by Kalanioumi when he, Kapulani, made his way to Kau safe from the clutches of the victors."

A penei ka moolelo o Lonoikamakahiki ma ia holo ana:","Subsequent to the slaughter of the chiefs of Hawaii by Lonoikamakahiki he consulted his wife Kaikilani for the purpose of going to Maui on a visit to Kamalalawalu. They decided, and so did all the chiefs, to allow them to go, in consequence of some plans Lonoikamakahiki had in view. On the day he was prepared to sail to Maui he selected a sufficient number of men, including his strongest and best-known warriors. He also selected his younger brother Pupuakea, well known as the premier and general, to accompany the party. On this voyage of Lonoikamakahiki he did not forget Hauna in his capacity as priest and counselor. The following is the tradition of Lonoikamakahiki concerning this voyage:"
"Ia Lonoikamakahiki i hiki aku ai ma Maui, e noho ana o Kamalalawalu ma Hana, ma ke Ahupuaa i oleloia o Wananalua. Ia Lonoikamakahiki i pae aku ai ma ke awa pae waa i Punahoa, ike ia mai la o Lonoikamakahiki e Kamalalawalu, kiiia mai [ ] la ua o Lonoikamakahiki a me kona poe a pau, hoihoiia aku la ma ko Kamalalawalu hale alii. Ia manawa, akahi no oia a ike maka i ke alii o Hawaii, he lohe wale no kona. Ua oleloia he makuakane no o ua Kamalalawalu nei no Lonoikamakahiki.","On Lonoikamakahiki’s arrival at Maui, Kamalalawalu was residing at Hana on the ahupuaa called Wananalua. When Lonoikamakahiki went ashore at the canoe landing of Punahoa he was observed by Kamalalawalu, Lonoikamakahiki and his [ ] retinue being sent for and taken to Kamalalawalu’s royal residence, it being the first time he had cast eyes on the king of Hawaii, although he had previously heard of him. It was said that Kamalalawalu was an uncle of Lonoikamakahiki."
"He mau la paha mahope iho, he mea mau no hoi ma na hale alii o ia manawa, ka inu awa. A nolaila, makemake ae la o Kamalalawalu e inu awa pu me Lonoikamakahiki. Nolaila olelo aku o Kamalalawalu ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Ua makemake au e inu awa kaua.” A e like me ka makemake o ke alii o Maui, pela i ae aku ai ko Hawaii alii.","A few days thereafter, it being customary at the royal residences of those times to drink awa, it came to pass that Kamalalawalu wanted the pleasure of drinking awa with Lonoikamakahiki, so he said to Lonoikamakahiki: “It is my pleasure that we drink awa.” In compliance with the wish of the king of Maui the king of Hawaii in like manner gave his assent."
"I aku la o Kamalalawalu ia Lonoikamakahiki: “E hele kaua i ka heenalu a hoi mai ua wali ka awa.” A nolaila, hele aku la laua. Mamua nae o ko laua hele ana i ka auau, ua hooholo mua laua, he moa ka pupu o ko laua awa ke inu. Ia manawa nae ua kauoha ae la laua i ko laua mau kaikaina e hoomakaukau i ka awa a me ka pupu, mamua o ko laua hoi ana mai mai ka auau.","Kamalalawalu said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Let us go surf riding and by the time we return the awa will be ready.” They went. Before going, however, they decided that they would have a chicken as an accompanying dish to go with their awa, and gave directions to their younger brothers to prepare the awa and the extra dish before they returned from their surfing."
"O ka pupu a laua i manao ai no ka inu ana i ko laua awa, he moa. Mamua o ko Lonoikamakahiki hele ana i ka heenalu, kauoha iho la oia ia Pupuakea penei: “Ke hele nei au i ka heenalu me ke alii o Maui nei, puholo ae oe i ka moa i hoi mai maua mai ka auau mai, ua makaukau.” A pau ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo ana i kona kaikaina, hele aku la oia me Kamalalawalu i ka auau. A o Kamalalawalu hoi, ua kauoha ae la no hoi oia i kona kaikaina ia Makakuikalani, e like me ka Lonoikamakahiki kauoha ia Pupuakea. Ma keia mau olelo a na ’lii, aole ma kahi hookahi ka laua kamailio ana i na kaikaina o laua. Aka ma ke kaawale no laua i olelo ai, me ka lohe ole aku o kekahi i kekahi. A hala aku la na ’lii i ka heenalu, a o Makakuikalani hoi hana iho la oia i ka moa a Kamalalawalu, a me ka awa. A pau ka moa i ka puholo, a me ka awa i ka mama, alaila kali aku o ka hoi mai o ke alii.","The side dish they desired to have with the awa they were to drink was chicken. Before Lonoikamakahiki started to surf he spoke to Pupuakea thus: “I’m going in surfing now with the king of Maui. You cook the chicken in blood and let it be ready when we return from surfing.” After giving these directions to his younger brother, he proceeded with Kamalalawalu to surf. As for Kamalalawalu, he also had given his younger brother Makakuikalani the same instructions as Lonoikamakahiki gave to Pupuakea. These instructions of the kings were each given to their brothers separate, apart and distinct from each other and not in the hearing of each other. Their majesties then went surfing. Makakuikalani prepared the chicken and awa for Kamalalawalu. The chicken cooked in blood and the awa masticated he awaited the return of the king."
"Aka, o Pupuakea, aole oia i hana i na mea a kona kaikuaana i kauoha ai ia ia, no ka mea, aole oia i ike i ka hana ana o ka moa, a me ka mama ana o ka awa, no ka mea, aole i maa. Aka nae, he mea haohao no ia ia Pupuakea, keia kauoha ana a Lonoikamakahiki, me ka ike no o ke alii, aole i maa o Pupuakea i ka hana ana o ka moa.","As for Pupuakea, however, he made no preparations as he was directed to, for the reason he knew not how to prepare chicken nor how to properly chew the awa, being unaccustomed to such things. It was a surprise to Pupuakea himself that Lonoikamakahiki should have ordered him to do so, knowing full well that he (Pupuakea) was not accustomed to preparing chickens."
"A hoi mai la na ’lii mai ka auau mai, ua makaukau o Kamalalawalu no kana mea e ai ai; a ninau aku la o Kamalalawalu ia Makakuikalani i ka makaukau; a hai mai la o Makakuikalani: “Ua makaukau, ua moa ka moa ua wali ka awa.” I aku la o Kamalalawalu: “Hoomakaukauia mai ka ai.” Alaila, ia manawa, lawelawe ia ae la na mea ai o ka ahaaina. A ia wa no, hoka iho la ka awa. A o Lonoikamakahiki, i kona manawa i hoi mai ai mai ka auau mai, ninau aku la ia Pupuakea: “Ea! Ke makaukau mai la ka Kamalalawalu mau mea ai; auhea hoi ka awa a me kau moe? Ua hana iho nei oe?” E konane ana nae o Pupuakea ia manawa. A i ko Pupuakea lohe ana i keia mau ninau a Lonoikamakahiki, hoole aku la o Pupuakea, me ka i aku: “Eiae no ka moa, aole i pepehi ia, aole no i mama ia ka awa, no ka mea, ua ike no oe, aole au i ike i ka hana ana o keia mau mea au i kauoha iho ai.”","On the return of their majesties from surfing, Kamalalawalu was ready for his meal. He inquired of Makakuikalani if it was ready, and he answered: “It is; the chicken is cooked and the awa is masticated.” So Kamalalawalu commanded: “Have the food served.” Preparations for the meal were made, the awa being strained at the order given for preparation. Lonoikamakahiki after having returned from surfing said to Pupuakea: “Preparations are being made for Kamalalawalu’s food. Where is my awa and chicken? Have you prepared them?” When Pupuakea was spoken to he was engaged playing konane. Upon hearing these inquiries of Lonoikamakahiki, Pupuakea replied: “No,” and said furthermore: “The chicken is here somewhere, not killed, nor has the awa been chewed, because you well know I have no knowledge of how to prepare the things you directed me to do.” [ ]"
"Ia manawa, wela ka huhu o Lonoikamakahiki, lalau iho la i ka papa konane, a hauhau aku la i ka lae o Pupuakea, a pa aku la ma ka lae, puai ke koko. A no ia mea, komo aku la ka huhu i loko o Pupuakea.

Because of this, Pupuakea was angered. Instantly he reached for the charcoal and firewood, started the fire, caught the chicken and choked it and tore away one of its legs. After having it skinned he broiled it over a fire at the same time reaching for the awa root. While the chicken was being broiled the awa was being chewed; with three quids of the awa the legs of the chicken were cooked, the awa strained and the cooked chicken legs placed on a platter. The awa cup was placed in front of the king, and also all the other things according to the directions given to Pupuakea. He said to the king: “The chicken and the awa are ready; it only awaits you to eat and to drink of the same.” When Lonoikamakahiki saw that the instructions he gave previous to surfing had been carried out, he ate before Kamalalawalu drank his awa."
"I ka manawa a Pupuakea e hana ana i ka moa nana pono mai la o Kamalalawalu, i ke kupanaha o ka Pupuakea hana ana, a makemake mai la. A pau ka laua inu awa ana a me ka paina ana, konane iho la ua mau alii nei. A iloko o ko laua manawa konane, olelo aku la o Kamalalawalu ia Lonoikamakahiki: “E, makemake aku la ka hoi au i kau kauwa, a i hoi oe ea, noho iho kau kauwa me a’u.” I aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kamalalawalu: “Aole ia he kauwa na’u, o ko’u kaulana aina no ia, a o ko’u kaikaina ponoi no ia. Aole e loaa aku ia oe.” A lohe o Kamalalawalu i keia olelo a Lonoikamakahiki i ka i ana, o ko’u kaulana aina no ia, nolaila olelo aku o Kamalalawalu: “Ina o kau kaulana aina kela, a o kou pukaua hoi ia, alaila ke olelo aku nei au, haahaa, haka pau i ka iole.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “O ka iki ulu makua ia nana e kaa ke kahualoa e pau ai.” A pau hoi ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo ana, alaila olelo aku o Kamalalawalu, me ke kuhikuhi ae ia Makakuikalani: “Ei ae no hoi ko’u kaulana aina, o ka’u pukaua no hoi keia, o ko’u kaikaina no.” A no ka Kamalalawalu hoohenehene ana i ko Lonoikamakahiki pukaua ia Pupuakea, nolaila olelo aku ai o Lonoikamakahiki i ka Kamalalawalu olelo ana: “O ko’u kaulana aina no hoi keia.” A nolaila o Lonoikamakahiki i olelo aku ai: “E, hakahaka, i ke ehu no o ka laau palau, kulana, aiwa a papa laau aku, o ka make no ia.” A no ka olelo ana mai a Lonoikamakahiki pela, i aku o Kamalalawalu: “O ka lila maia ia o Kaea, aole e pala i ke anahulu.”","While Pupuakea was preparing the chicken, Kamalalawalu took particular notice of the peculiar manner in which Pupuakea was doing it and rather admired the manner in which it was being done. After partaking of the awa and finishing their meal, the kings played konane, and during the game Kamalalawalu said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Say, I rather like your servant. Should you go home, let your servant remain with me.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “He is not a servant of mine, he is my notable and younger brother. You can not have him.” Therefore Kamalalawalu said: “If he is your notable and your general also, then I say to you, it is a low shelf which the rats will get at.” Lonoikamakahiki retorted: “He is a small maika that can cover a long course.” After Lonoikamakahiki had finished talking, Kamalalawalu, pointing to Makakuikalani, said: “There is my notable, my general, and my younger brother also.” Because Kamalalawalu ridiculed Lonoikamakahiki’s general, Pupuakea, Lonoikamakahiki, referring to Kamalalawalu’s statement, “This my notable,” remarked: “He is hollow; the swirl of the war club would stagger him; a touch of the club would kill him.” In consequence of this remark of Lonoikamakahiki, Kamalalawalu replied: “He is the shrivelled banana of Kaea, which will not ripen in ten days.”"
"Iloko o keia mau olelo a Lonoikamakahiki me Kamalalawalu, waiho wale iloko o laua ia mea. A he mau manawa he nui mahope iho o keia mau hana a laua, i ka manawa i hoi aku ai o Lonoikamakahiki mai kana huakai kaapuni aku, manao ae la o Kamalalawalu e luku aku ma ke kaua i na ’lii o Hawaii, no ka mea, ua kui aku la ka lono o ko Lonoikamakahiki ikaika a me ka lanakila i ke kaua.","The passage of words between Lonoikamakahiki and Kamalalawalu were treasured and stored up within themselves. After a considerable time following the events narrated, and subsequent to the return of Lonoikamakahiki from his tour, Kamalalawalu entertained the idea to destroy by war the chiefs of Hawaii in consequence of reports having been brought of Lonoikamakahiki’s strength and his success in war."
"A o Kauhiokalani, ka Kamalalawalu keiki ponoi; o Kauhiakama hoi kekahi inoa ona. Hoouna aku la o Kamalalawalu i kana keiki e holo i Hawaii, me ka i aku: “E holo oe e nana i ka nui o na kanaka o Hawaii, hoi mai oe a hai mai ia’u.”","Kamalalawalu dispatched his own child Kauhiokalani, otherwise known as Kauhiakama, for Hawaii instructing him thus: “You go to learn the number of people there are on Hawaii, and on your return report to me.”"
"Nolaila, e like me ko Kamalalawalu makemake, holo aku la o Kauhiokalani ka mea i kapaia o Kauhiakama i Hawaii. Ia holo ana, pae mua aku la oia ma Kohala, ma ke awa pae waa i oleloia o Puakea. A hiki oia malaila kau na waa, hele aku la ma na kahakai o Kohala a hiki i Kawaihae; aka aole i loaa nui na kanaka ia ia ma ia hele ana aku, he kakaikahi loa. [ ]","In accordance with the wish of Kamalalawalu, Kauhiokalani, otherwise known as Kauhiakama, sailed for Hawaii. He arrived at Kohala at a landing place for canoes known as Puakea. Having arrived there, the canoes were put ashore and he began his itinerary along the coast of Kohala until he reached Kawaihae. On his journey he found very few people. [ ]"
"Hele aku la ua o Kauhiakama mai laila aku a hiki i Kona, i Kapalilua, ma ka palena o Kau a me Kona, aole no ia i halawai nui me na kanaka. Pela kana hele ana a puni o Hawaii, aole oia i ike i ka lehulehu o na kanaka i loaa ia ia.

No ka mea, he mea mau ma ia wahi, ka akoakoa mau i kela la keia la i ka mokomoko.","Kauhiakama thence travelled on from there to Kona Kapalilua, at the boundary of Kau and Kona, not meeting many people. He continued on until he made the circuit of Hawaii, without seeing a great many people. At Kapaau, Kohala, on his homeward journey, there was congregated a large concourse of people at the athletic grounds called Hinakahua, it being customary for the people to gather together at this place for athletic contests."
"I iho la o Kauhiakama: “Kai noa ua nui aku ko Hawaii nei mau kanaka, aole ka; he kaulana wale iho no ka he moku nui, a o ke kanaka, he uuku loa. Ina la hoi e like ka nui o na kanaka o kahi a’u i hele ae nei e makaikai e like me koonei mau wahi kanaka, ina la hoi e aho ia; aole, he ole loa no ka.”","Kauhiakama remarked: “I thought Hawaii had more people, but not so; it is only noted as being a large island, but as to the inhabitants there are very few. If the people on the route of my travel were only as numerically large as the people of this place, it would be something, but I find it is not so.”"
"A ike iho la o Kauhiakama i ka nui o na kanaka o Kohala ma ia kaapuni ana, alaila hoi aku la oia a hiki i Maui.

A oia ka mea i olelo ia e ka poe kahiko.","Kauhiakama, having observed the population of Kohala during this circuit, returned to Maui. Upon arrival there, Kamalalawalu asked him: “How is Hawaii?” Kauhiakama replied: “Kohala is depopulated; the people are only at the beach, because during my circuit of Hawaii I did not find a large number of them. I first arrived at Kohala, then traveled along its shore until Kawaihae was reached and did not meet a solitary man. At the place of my landing, however, I met a few, not exceeding forty, perhaps, and at Kawaihae there were some places with few men. I proceeded from Kawaihae through Kona to a part of Kau, all the way not meeting many people. That is the most desolate place, composed of nothing but clinkers. I continued my circuit from Kau to Puna, Hilo and Hamakua. I do not recollect coming in contact with three four hundred (1200) men. On my way to Kohala I found it to be the only locality which contained some people. Kohala is depopulated; the people are only at the beach.” Kamalalawalu having heard this report from his son Kauhiakama ordered Makakuikalani to make preparations for war. It has been mentioned in this narrative that two men came from Hawaii who urged Kamalalawalu to give battle to Hawaii, being Kauhipaewa and Kihapaewa, the sons of Kumaikeau and another. According to the old historians it was Lonoikamakahiki himself who sent these two men to urge Kamalalawalu to go to war with Hawaii. And this is the story told concerning the two men. Because of Lonoikamakahiki’s intense desire to wage battle with Kamalalawalu, the former sent Kauhipaewa and Kihapaewa to consult Kamalalawalu concerning it. These two men arrived before Kamalalawalu without the latter knowing that they were emissaries from Lonoikamakahiki. On the occasion of the two men meeting Kamalalawalu, they remarked: “Go and make war on Hawaii, as you can take it if you give battle, because Lonoikamakahiki has no power, nor has his general either.” Because of the remarks of these two men to Kamalalawalu, he harbored the idea of going to Hawaii to wage war."
"A penei hoi ka olelo a kekahi poe malama moolelo.

Ma keia ano wale no i lana nui ai o Kamalalawalu e hele e kaua ia Lonoikamakahiki.","The following is said by some of the ancient historians to be the correct narrative: Because of Lonoikamakahiki’s desire to test the strength of their two generals, putting into effect the compliments exchanged between them at the time of the awa drinking both Kihapea and Kauhipea said to Kamalalawalu: “If you should sail for Hawaii to give battle to Lonoikamakahiki, let us carry on the war from the top of Puuoaoaka and Hokuula. Let us occupy these places first; we will then possess the [ ] stones on the heights and compel Lonoikamakahiki to do his fighting from below; we, being above, would only have to roll the rocks and thus will the people of Hawaii be defeated by those of Maui.” So said these men to Kamalalawalu, which was nothing more nor less than deception, expressed so as to bring about Kamalalawalu’s destruction. It was only by such means that Kamalalawalu’s high ambitions were aroused to wage war against Lonoikamakahiki."
"Mahope iho o ka Kauhipaewa ma kamailio ana ia Kamalalawalu no ke kaua, alaila hoi aku la laua i Hawaii. A i ka hiki ana aku i Hawaii, e noho ana o Lonoikamakahiki i Puako ia manawa, e kali ana no ia Kauhipaewa ma i ka hoi aku.

A hala aku la o Kauhipaewa ma i Hawaii; alaila, hoomakaukau ae la o Kamalalawalu no ka holo i ke kaua i Hawaii.","After Kauhipaewa and his companion made their final statement to Kamalalawalu concerning war they immediately returned to Hawaii. Upon their arrival at Hawaii, Lonoikamakahiki was then residing at Puako, awaiting the return of Kauhipaewa and his companion. Upon their arrival the king inquired as to their mission. They made report as to conversations had with Kamalalawalu. Lonoikamakahiki then made preparations for war, so as to be ready when Kamalalawalu made his appearance. After Kauhipaewa and his companion had departed for Hawaii Kamalalawalu made preparations to sail thither for war."
"A ike ae la o Lanikaula, e hoomakaukau ana no ka holo i Hawaii i ke kaua me Lonoikamakahiki, i aku la o Lanikaula ia Kamalalawalu: “Auhea oe, e hoomakaukau ana keia mau waa ou a hele ihea?” I aku la o Kamalalawalu: “E holo ana e kaua me Lonoikamakahiki.” I aku o Lanikaula: “Aole e hee o Lonoikamakahiki ia oe, no ka mea, aole he ikaika nui e loaa ai o Lonoikamakahiki, no ka mea, he kanaka oe, a he akua kela.” I aku o Kamalalawalu: “Ka!

Preparing these canoes of yours to go where?” Kamalalawalu replied: “To sail to fight Lonoikamakahiki.” Lanikaula replied: “You will not defeat Lonoikamakahiki, because no amount of strength will ever overcome Lonoikamakahiki, for the reason that you are a human being and he a god.” Kamalalawalu made answer: “Kauhiakama says Kohala is depopulated; the people are only at the beach.” To this remark of Kamalalawalu, Lanikaula replied: “You sent your son Kauhiakama to investigate as to how many people there were on Hawaii. He returned and made his report to you that there were not many people there, but Kauhiakama did not see the number of people in Kohala because he traveled on the seashore, reaching Kona from Kawaihae and arrived on the heights of Huehue. He could not have seen the people of that locality because there were only clinkers there, having proceeded along by way of Kona until he arrived at Kau. If he had traveled along the Kona route in the early morning he could not have met people at that time because the inhabitants of that section had gone to the uplands and some had gone fishing; those remaining home were only the feeble and sick, therefore the people of Kona could not have been seen by Kauhiakama on his tour. Had he gone during the evening he would surely have seen the large population of Kona because it is the largest district of Hawaii.”"
"Ma keia olelo a Lanikaula, aole nae he hoomaopopo nui o Kamalalawalu ia olelo, aka hoomau no o Kamalalawalu i kona manao kaua.

He still inclined to the idea of war. Lanikaula observed that Kamalalawalu was bent on going to war. He therefore spoke to Kamalalawalu again: “If you [ ] intend to go to war with Lonoikamakahiki, then your grounds should be at Anaehoomalu; and should Lonoikamakahiki come to meet you, then let the battle be fought at Pohakuloa, it being a narrow place; then you will be victorious over Hawaii.” Kamalalawalu answered: “You do not know, because I was distinctly told by both Kauhipaewa and Kihapaewa that our battle field should be on Hokuula and Puuoaoaka, it being a place of eminence. ” Lanikaula again said: “You are being deceived by the sons of Kumaikeau and others; you have been led astray, therefore listen to me, for if you heed not my admonitions I do not think that you will ever come home to Maui nei again.”"

But Lanikaula, out of sympathy for the king, did not cease to again give him warning: “Kamalalawalu! You are very persistent to have war. This is what I have to say to you: Better hold temple services these few days before you proceed. Propitiate the gods first, then go.” But Kamalalawalu would not harken to the words of Lanikaula, therefore he ended his remarks. Makakuikalani made the preparations of the war canoes in accordance with the strict orders of Kamalalawalu. When the canoes and the several generals, together with all the men, including the war canoes of Kamalalawalu, were ready floating in the harbor of Hamoa, Lanikaula came forth and in the presence of King Kamalalawalu and his war canoes prophesied in chant his last words to Kamalalawalu:"
"Koae ula ke koae kea, Koae lele pauma ana; Kiekie iluna ka hoku, Haahaa i au ka malama.

It is mentioned in this tradition relative to the number of canoes of Kamalalawalu that the rear war canoes were at Hamoa, Hana, and the van at Puakea, Kohala; but at the time of this narrative the opinions of the ancients differed as to the accuracy of this. Some say that the number of canoes is greatly exaggerated."

At the first meeting that Kamalalawalu had with Kauhipaewa and others, Kumaikeau and others [ ] (who were men from the presence of Lonoikamakahiki) said to Kamalalawalu: “Carry the canoes inland; take the outriggers off so that should the Hawaii forces be defeated in battle they would not use the flotilla of Maui to escape. When they find that the outriggers have all been taken apart and the victors overtake them the slaughter will be yours.” Kamalalawalu did as he was told to do by the two old men."

Kamalalawalu learning that Kanaloakuaana was still living at Waimea he concluded that his first battle should be fought with Kanaloakuaana and at Kaunooa. Kanaloakuaana was completely routed and pursued by the soldiers of Kamalalawalu, and Kauhiakama, and Kanaloakuaana was captured at Puako. At this battle the eyes of Kanaloakuaana were gouged out by the Maui forces, the eye sockets pierced by darts, and he was then killed, the eyes of Kanaloakuaana being tatued."

Because of the perpetration of this dastardly act on Kanaloakuaana the following was composed by a writer of chants, being the middle portion of a chant called “Koauli”:"

The Maui forces followed and after locating at Hokuula awaited the [ ] coming fray. On the day Kamalalawalu and his men went up to Waimea to occupy Hokuula the two deceitful old men at the time were with Kamalalawalu. In the early morning when Kamalalawalu awoke from sleep he beheld the men from Kona and those of Kau, Puna, Hilo, Hamakua and Kohala had also been assembled."

Kamalalawalu was astonished, because the day before he observed that the lava was one mass of black, but this morning it was entirely red with people. Thereupon Kamalalawalu inquired of Kumaikeau and the others why the lava was a mass of red: “What does red portend? Does it mean war?” Kumaikeau and the others replied: “Do not think the red you see is some other red and not what you assume it to be. It is not war. That red yonder is the wind. The olauniu wind of Kalahuipuaa and Puako had been blowing in the early morning and when it is very light and gentle it hugs the lava close. This olauniu wind on the lava coming in contact with the wind from Wainaualii raises a cloud of dust covering and hiding the land in the manner you saw yesterday. ” While cogitating to himself, Kamalalawalu concluded to drop the matter on account of the deceit of the two old men and the loss of confidence in what Kumaikeau and the others had said, for the reason that the lava continued to be strewn with people even to the time of the setting sun. During that night and including the following morning the Kona men arrived and were assigned to occupy a position from Puupa to Haleapala. The Kau and Puna warriors were stationed from Holoholoku to Waikoloa. Those of Hilo and Hamakua were located from Mahiki to Puukanikanihia, while those of Kohala guarded from Momoualoa to Waihaka."
"Ia kakahiaka, nana aku la o Kamalalawalu, ua uhi paa puia mai olalo i na kanaka, aole o kana mai. Alaila, nana ae la o Kamalalawalu ia lakou ua uuku loa; alaila, olelo aku la o Kamalalawalu ia Kumaikeau ma: “Ea! E Kumaikeau ma, pehea keia? Heaha keia lehulehu olalo?”","That morning Kamalalawalu observed that the lowlands were literally covered with almost countless men. Kamalalawalu then took a survey of his own men and realized that his forces were inferior in numbers. He then spoke to Kumaikeau and the others: “Kumaikeau and the rest of you, how is this and what is that large concourse of people below?”"
"I aku o Kumaikeau ma: “Akahi no au a ike i ka nui o na kanaka o Hawaii nei. Mai manao nae oe ia nui, e pakele ana ia kakou. Aole e pakele, aia ka lakou kaua malalo, he nui lakou, o ko lakou kaa malalo, make no ia kakou.”","Kumaikeau and the others replied: “We have never seen so many people in Hawaii before. Do not think that because of their superior numbers they will escape us; they cannot, for the reason that their fighting will have to be from below. It is true they are more numerous, but being beneath we will defeat them.”"
"I kekahi la ae, hele aku la o Lonoikamakahiki e halawai me Kamalalawalu, e kuka no ke kaua. A i ko laua kamailio ana, olelo aku o Kamalalawalu ia Lonoikamakahiki, e hoopau wale ke kaua, no ka mea, ua hopo mai la o Kamalalawalu no ka nui loa o ka Lonoikamakahiki kaua. Aka, ma kela olelo kaua a Kamalalawalu e hoopau wale ke kaua, aohe manao o Lonoikamakahiki e hoopau, e like me ka Kamalalawalu olelo, no ka mea, ua wela ko Lonoikamakahiki huhu no Kamalalawalu, no ka pepehi hoomainoino ana ia Kanaloakuaana; oia hoi, ua poaloia na maka, a ua hoomainoino ia i ko Kanaloakuaana wa e ola okoa ana.","The following day, Lonoikamakahiki went over to meet Kamalalawalu to confer concerning the war. During their conference Kamalalawalu proposed to Lonoikamakahiki that war cease because he feared the greater forces of Lonoikamakahiki. But the proposal by Kamalalawalu for termination of the war did not meet Lonoikamakahiki’s approval. He had no intention of acquiescing, because he was greatly incensed at Kamalalawalu for the brutal manner in which he killed Kanaloakuaana by gouging out the eyes and other brutal acts carried into execution while the latter was still alive."
"Aka hoi, o Makakuikalani, i kona lohe ana ia Kamalalawalu ua olelo aku oia ia Lonoikamakahiki e hoopau i ke kaua, he mea makemake ole nae ia ia Makakuikalani. Oia hoi, ua olelo aku o ua Makakuikalani nei ia Kamalalawalu, aole e hoopau i ke kaua. “Ho aku imua a kau i ka nananuu; alaila ike ia na keiki makua o kakou.” A no ia manaopaa o Makakuikalani, hoike mau ae la oia imua o ko Hawaii kaua i kela la keia la pau na la ekolu.

Then will it be known which of us is a full grown child.” This determination on the part of Makakuikalani was manifested by his presence for three consecutive days before the forces of Hawaii. After the third day, the two combatting forces waged battle, Lonoikamakahiki gaining the victory over Kamalalawalu’s entire force on the same day the battle was fought, the Maui-ites being completely routed."
"A penei hoi ka moolelo oia hoouka kaua ana i oleloia e ka poe kahiko, ma ka lakou malama moolelo ana. Mamua o ka hoouka kaua ana, he mea mau i na elemakule ka paipai ana ia Kamalalawalu e kaua.

Before the battle commenced it was customary for the old men to encourage Kamalalawalu to do battle. Whenever the two old men heard what Kamalalawalu and the others had to say as to what they intended doing to Lonoikamakahiki in order to be victorious in battle, the old men would wend their way to make it known to Lonoikamakahiki and the others and this duty was generally carried out during some convenient time of night. The two old men always pointed out to Kamalalawalu and the others where the battle should be fought, and the suggestions of the old men were always received with the utmost confidence by him. Therefore Kumaikeau and the two deceitful old men would in turn inform Lonoikamakahiki. The two old men never suggested any place for battle which would result advantageously to Kamalalawalu and his forces; on the contrary, it was invariably such a locality where inevitable defeat would result."
"I ka la o ka hoouka kaua, ma ke kakahiaka nui, hele aku la o Makakuikalani mamua, a o kona poe kaua mahope ona, a ma Waikakanilua, malalo aku o Hokuula a me Puuoaoaka, ma ka hulei e nana iho ana ia Waikoloa.

Aka, ua makaukau no na aoao a elua no ke kaua.","In the early morning of the day of battle, Makakuikalani went to the front with his warriors following him and planted themselves at Waikakanilua below Hokuula and Puuoaoaka at a prominence looking towards Waikoloa. Pupuakea, on observing that Makakuikalani was placing his men and self in position, he and his warriors immediately came forward prepared to give battle. It was a case where both sides were equally prepared for the fray."
"He kanaka nui a loihi o Makakuikalani, ka pukaua ikaika kaulana o Maui, ko Kamalalawalu kaikaina. A o Pupuakea hoi, ko Hawaii pukaua ikaika kaulana, ko Lonoikamakahiki kaikaina, he wahi kanaka uuku no ia, a haahaa hoi.

As for Pupuakea, Hawaii’s celebrated and powerful general and who was Lonoikamakahiki’s younger brother, he was only a man of small stature. Both men had been taught the art of fighting with the wooden club and were experts in its use, but their schooling was under different masters and at different places."
"Aka, o Pupuakea, iloko o kona manawa i ike aku ai ia Makakuikalani, aole i komo mai iloko ona ka makau, aole no hoi oia i weliweli, aka, kupaa mau no oia e kaua aku ia Makakuikalani.","On the day of battle the sight of Makakuikalani put Lonoikamakahiki’s forces in dreadful fear. When Pupuakea saw Makakuikalani he had no fear of him, did not tremble but stood firm ready to give battle."
"Ia Makakuikalani a me Pupuakea e ku ana ma ke kahua kaua, ia manawa, lawe ae la o Makakuikalani i kana laau palau a kiekie, a hahau iho la maluna iho o Pupuakea, a no ka haahaa o Pupuakea, ua pa lihi aku la o Pupuakea, aka, haule aku la o Pupuakea ilalo i ka honua.

Being short in stature he was only slightly struck but fell to the ground, however. At the instant Makakuikalani’s war club struck Pupuakea the end of it was buried deep into the ground. At the moment Pupuakea was struck by the war club and fell Makakuikalani thought that he was killed, but the latter’s master saw that Pupuakea was not dead, so [ ] said to Makakuikalani: “Go back and slay him for your opponent is not dead. Your clubbing being from above only delivered a blow with the butt end.” Makakuikalani hearing the words of his teacher turned around and threw the butt end of his club, at the same time telling him to “Shut up! Instruction stops at home. He cannot escape, he must be dead because the club strikes true.” At the very instant that Makakuikalani faced around to talk with his teacher, he (the teacher) was dead."
"I ka manawa a Pupuakea e waiho ana i ka honua, ua maule aku la oia, a mahope loaa mai la ka mama iki ana ae, ia manawa, ala ae la o Pupuakea mai ka honua ae; ia manawa ike mai la o Makakuikalani ua ola hou o Pupuakea, alaila, holo hou mai la o Makakuikalani imua o Pupuakea, me ka manao e hoomake loa ia Pupuakea.","Pupuakea was lying on the ground, stunned, but somewhat recovered afterwards and raised himself up from the ground. When Makakuikalani saw that Pupuakea was still alive he rushed towards him bent on killing him."
"A ike aku la o Pupuakea ia Makakuikalani e hele mai ana e kue hou iaia, alaila hoomakaukau ae la oia e pepehi aku ia Makakuikalani.

Make aku la i ka laau a kaua i ka hualepo.”","Pupuakea observed Makakuikalani’s approach so prepared himself to slay him. When Makakuikalani drew near, Pupuakea raised his club and twirled it from his right. At that moment Makakuikalani attempted also to lay his club on Pupuakea, and when his club was twirled it skidded along the ground towards the feet of Makakuikalani and being parried by Makaku, fell to the ground. When Makakuikalani swung his club from the left side it struck the back of his own neck and he was instantly killed. Pupuakea immediately stepped backward and met his master who said to him: “Go back again and slay him so he be dead.” The words of his master aroused Pupuakea’s pride and he said to his teacher: “He cannot live, he is dead.” Then looking at the palm of his hand he again said to his master: “He cannot be alive because the birthmark of Pupuakea has impressed itself thereon. The flying club through dust has killed him.”"

A penei ka moolelo o kona pakele ana.",After the great and renowned general of Maui had fallen the Hawaii forces continued to slaughter Kamalalawalu and the others. Upon the death of Kamalalawalu the slaughter of the Maui-ites continued for three days thereafter and those defeated who ran towards their canoes found no arms and outriggers because they had been broken. The repulsed warriors ran to Puako and noticing the paimalau floating in the sea mistook them for canoes. They began to waver and were again overtaken by the victors. The destruction of the remaining invaders was then complete. Referring to Kauhiakama the son of Kamalalawalu he escaped to safety. The story of his escape running thus:
"I ka la o ka hee ana o ko Maui poe kaua, holo malu aku la oia a hiki i Kawaihae, a malaila mai e holo ana me ka manao e pee ma na ana, a hiki i ka wa e lanakila ai, alaila hoike ae.","On the day that the Maui forces were defeated Kauhiakama clandestinely escaped to Kawaihae and from there his intentions were to hie to the caves, there to remain until his side was victorious and then make his appearance."
"A o Hinau, kekahi o na pukaua o Lonoikamakahiki, he elele no na Lonoikamakahiki, aka, ua nui loa ke aloha o Hinau ia Kauhiakama. Nolaila, mamua o ko Hinau manao ana e hoomahuka ia Kauhiakama, pulehu ae la oia i mau kalo, a moa, a paa pu ae la me na oopu maloo i pulehuia, a imi aku la ia Kauhiakama; ma Kawaihaeo ko Hinau hiki mua ana, a malaila aku a hiki i Kaiopae, ike mua aku la o Hinau ia Kauhiakama, alaila, kahea aku la: “E Kauhiakama e!

A pau ia, hoomahuka aku la o Hinau ia Kauhiakama, a hala aku la i Maui, a pela i pakele ai o Kauhiakama i na lima o kona poe enemi.","Hinau, one of the generals of Lonoikamakahiki and a messenger also, had great affection for Kauhiakama, but it was previous to the time of Hinau’s assisting in the escape of Kauhiakama that he roasted some taro and, together with some dried mudfish, already roasted, proceeded to search for Kauhiakama. Hinau came to Kawaihae first and from there went to Kaiopae where for the first time he saw Kauhiakama, so Hinau hailed him and said: “Say, Kauhiakama, remain there until I reach you!” Kauhiakama looking round saw Hinau approaching, the thought of death at the hands of the victorious crossed his mind, so covering his face with his hands he wept, for he [ ] was greatly depressed in spirits. Hinau came forward, however, and greeted him with a kiss on the nose, remarking: “I remained behind and roasted some taro and dried mudfish for the love of you and came to search for you.” These words of Hinau gave Kauhiakama great relief and hopes for life. Kauhiakama then ate of the taro prepared by Hinau and when he had finished Hinau assisted Kauhiakama to escape to Maui. Thus was Kauhiakama saved from falling into the hands of his enemies."
"Ia Kauhiakama i hoi ai a Maui, hapai nui ae la oia ia Hinau, a kapa ae la i ka inoa o ka hale o Hinau, na umeke a me na ipukai, o Hinau; a kapa aku la i ka inoa o na mahinaai koele o Hinau. Ua kapaia na mea a pau a Kauhiakama o Hinau; he mau mea e hoomanao ana i na mea a pau a Hinau i hana maikai aku ai ia ia (Kauhiakama).",Upon Kauhiakama’s return to Maui he sang the praises of Hinau; named his house after him and also the calabashes and fish-bowls. The cultivated fields were also named after him. Everything he possessed was named after Hinau in memory of the many tokens of friendship and kindness shown to him.
"A he mau makahiki he nui ma ia hope mai, kui aku la ka lono ia Lonoikamakahiki, a lohe oia i keia mau hana a Kauhiakama, ma ke kapa ana i na mea a pau ana, mamuli o ka inoa Hinau.

In consequence of this certain messengers were dispatched to Maui by Lonoikamakahiki to get Hinau. Before the departure of the emissaries to get Hinau he instructed them thus: “You go and bring Hinau by my command, and should you meet him, say to him to return to Hawaii and govern the country because I am going to Kauai, to view the trunkless koa tree of Kahihikolo. He is to be in my stead and inform him so. Should he board your canoes, take him to Alenuihaha channel, tear him alive in the sea, because he has done wrong by assisting Kauhiakama to escape, thus violating my very commands, to allow no one of Maui with royal blood to live.” After he had given these instructions to his emissaries they set sail for Maui."
"A i ka halawai ana o ua mau luna nei me Hinau, ike aku la nae ua mau luna nei, o Hinau ke kanaka koikoi o Maui imua o Kauhiakama, a oia hookahi no ka punahele oi imua o ko Kauhiakama alo. Aka, ma na mea i kauohaia ia lakou na luna e hana aku, alaila hana aku la no lakou e like me ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo.","When the emissaries met Hinau they learned that he was the greatest man in Maui in the retinue of Kauhiakama and was the latter’s cherished favorite. However, the instructions had to be carried out and the same were discharged in a manner that was entirely pleasing to Lonoikamakahiki."
"A i ka lohe ana o Hinau i keia mau olelo a Lonoikamakahiki ma ka waha aku o ua mau luna nei, a ike mai la o Hinau ua ano oiaio na olelo a pau i haiia aku iaia, alaila, hooholo ae la oia i kona manao ae no na mea i hai ia aku ai.

A make aku la o Hinau, hoi aku la na luna a hai aku la i ka make ana o Hinau. Alaila, ua loaa ka oluolu ia Lonoikamakahiki.","Hinau heard the wishes of Lonoikamakahiki from the lips of the emissaries, and believing the truth of the message decided to obey the same. Kauhiakama had no intention of allowing Hinau to sail to Hawaii for he was worried lest he return not again to Maui. Hinau, however, was under the belief that he was to rule only during the time of Lonoikamakahiki’s absence on Kauai, and when he returned, he (Hinau) would again return to Maui. Upon Hinau’s boarding the canoes and sailing for Hawaii while yet breathing with life he was cut in two whilst in the open sea by the emissaries in compliance with the instructions of Lonoikamakahiki. So died Hinau. On the return of the men they reported having put Hinau to death in the manner desired, thus gratifying the wishes of Lonoikamakahiki."
"A pau ke kaua ana me Kamalalawalu ma Waimea, a mahope iho o ka make ana o Hinau, ia manawa hoomaopopo hou ae la o Lonoikamakahiki e holo i Kauai; oia hoi i ike aku ai oia ia Kahihikolo, i kahi o ke koa kumu ole.

For that voyage Lonoikamakahiki made preparations [ ] to take along with him his favorites, his warriors as companions and also his servants."
"Aka o Kaikilani, hoonohoia iho la oia ma ke ano hooponopono aina, a e malama hoi i na makaainana. A makaukau ko ke alii holo i Kauai, alaila holo aku la.

All preparations having been made the king sailed for Kauai arriving there with his entire retinue. Lonoikamakahiki went alone to view the trunkless tree of Kahihikolo his entire retinue having deserted him. There was a native, however, of the place by the name of Kapaihiahilina who joined the king on his tour. The king while thus journeying happened to look back to see where the rest of his people were and saw only a solitary man following him in the rear. He was a stranger with whom he had no acquaintance. Of the large retinue which accompanied him from Hawaii not one was there, every man had deserted."
"I ka manawa o ke alii i ike mai ai ia Kapaihiahilina e ukali ana, aole oia i ekemu mai, aka, hoomau aku la no o Lonoikamakahiki i ka hele imua, me ka mea ole nana e kuhikuhi i kahi ana i hilinai nui ai e ike.

Ia manawa, akahi no a kamailio aku o Lonoikamakahiki iaia, me ka ninau aku: “E hele ana oe ihea?” I aku la o Kapaihiahilina: “I ukali wale mai nei no wau ia oe, no ka mea, lohe ae nei wau i ou kanaka i hoi ae nei, ua pau i ka haalele ia oe, nolaila, aloha ia oe, ukali mai nei.”","When the king observed Kapaihiahilina following him, he said not a word to him but continued on with his journey without even a guide to indicate the place he so much desired to see. When Lonoikamakahiki again turned back Kapaihiahilina was still following him. At this stage Lonoikamakahiki asked the man: “Where are you going?” Kapaihiahilina replied: “I merely followed you, because I heard from your people who were on their way back, that they had deserted you, and having sympathy for you, I followed.”"
"A o ua o Kapaihiahilina, iloko o kona manawa i lohe ai ua haaleleia, nolaila, lawe ae la oia i umeke poi, me na kauna oopu, a imi aku la i ke alii. He mea mau hoi ia Kapaihiahilina i na la a pau o kana ukali ana ia Lonoikamakahiki, ka malama ana i na kanawai o ke kapu alii. Oia hoi, i ka manawa kakahiaka nui, ka manawa e loihi ana ke aka o ke alii, aole o Kapaihiahilina i ike i ko laua kokoolua o laua wale, a’e aku i ke aka, aka, malama mau no oia i ke kapu alii.","Kapaihiahilina, upon being told that the king had been deserted, took a calabash of poi and some fours of mud-fish, and went in search of the king. It was Kapaihiahilina’s habit during the days he followed the king to observe the etiquette due to royalty, that is to say, during the early morning when the royal shadow was the longest, Kapaihiahilina, aware there were only the two of them, did not cross his shadow but always respected his royal dignity and position."
"A he mea mau hoi ia Lonoikamakahiki ka nana mau ana ia Kapaihiahilina ma kona ano menemene alii. A iloko o kekahi la o ka laua hele ana, i ka manawa e hookaawale ana o Kapaihiahilina iaia iho, ma ka hele ana, ma ka noho ana a me ka moe ana, i aku la o Lonoikamakahiki iaia: “Mai hookapukapu mai oe ia’u, no ka mea, o oe no ko’u hoahanau ponoi, aole a’u mea nui e ae, o oe hookahi wale no; nolaila, ma ko’u wahi moe, malaila mai oe, mai hookaawale oe ia’u, no ka mea ua pale ka pono eia kaua i ke au akua kahi i hele ai.” A nolaila, ua hookoia ka ke alii olelo, a noho pu iho la laua.","Lonoikamakahiki constantly observed Kapaihiahilina’s conduct as being most respectful of royalty. One day in the course of their journey, Kapaihiahilina, always to the rear of him at a respectable distance both when walking and when at sleep, Lonoikamakahiki said to him: “Do not hold me in sacredness because you are my own brother. I have nothing dearer than yourself, therefore, where I sleep, there will you sleep also. Do not hold me aloof, because all that is good has passed and we are now traveling in the region of the gods.” In consequence of this, the king’s wishes were observed, and they sat down together."

They were in great need of clothing and destitute of malo and had to use braided ferns in substitution thereof. They wandered on in this manner until they arrived at the place which Lonoikamakahiki was so desirous of seeing, which place was called Kahihikolo, but still continued on until they reached the shore. During these travels they were in the greatest distress from lack of food, lack of clothing, lack of malo and also distress from the rains. There was locked in the bosom of Lonoikamakahiki the thought always of how he should some day reward Kapaihiahilina. On their return from their mountain wanderings, Kapaihiahilina became a premier and a [ ] great favorite. Whatever belonged to Lonoikamakahiki in large as well as small things which had been left in charge of the men and the petty chiefs, including also the lands, all were under the administration of Kapaihiahilina. Before the eyes of Lonoikamakahiki no one else was superior to Kapaihiahilina and he was supreme over the island of Hawaii. Upon Lonoikamakahiki’s return to Hawaii after his sojourn in the mountains, he took Kapaihiahilina with him to Hawaii and appointed him his premier and held him as an esteemed favorite."
"Ma ko Lonoikamakahiki wahi moe, malaila o Kapaihiahilina e moe ai, ma kona wahi e noho ai, malaila pu no me Kapaihiahilina. O ka puloulou kapu alii, hiki ole i na punahele mua ana ke komo aku, malaila o Kapaihiahilina e noho ai. Aka, i ka hiki ana o Lonoikamakahiki i Hawaii me Kapaihiahilina, ike mai la na ilamuku a me na kakaolelo a Lonoikamakahiki, ua kela aku ka punahele o Kapaihiahilina mamua o na punahele mua, alaila, inoino ae la ko lakou manao no Kapaihiahilina, no ka mea, aole i hanaia kekahi mau punahele mamua e like me keia.","Wherever Lonoikamakahiki slept, there Kapaihiahilina slept also; wherever he lived, there also would Kapaihiahilina reside. The emblem of royal sacredness (puloulou) where his former favorites were not permitted to tread, there would Kapaihiahilina be found. When Lonoikamakahiki arrived on Hawaii with his companion the marshals and the statesmen of Lonoikamakahiki observed that Kapaihiahilina’s favoritism exceeded that of the king’s former favorites, and they became embittered at the idea and were envious of him for the reason that his former favorites never received such consideration."
"I kekahi la, hoakoakoa ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i kona mau kaukau alii a pau, a me kona mau kakaolelo, a hoike aku la i ko Kapaihiahilina lilo ana i poo kiekie ma ka aina a puni o Hawaii. Aka, he mea oluolu ole nae ia i ko na ’lii manao, a me ko Lonoikamakahiki alo alii a pau.","On a certain day, Lonoikamakahiki assembled all of his nobility and statesmen and declared that Kapaihiahilina was denominated the chief personage of all Hawaii. But this was not agreeable to the chiefs’ views and the court of Lonoikamakahiki."
"Mahope iho o ko Kapaihiahilina lilo ana i kuhina nui no Lonoikamakahiki, haawi ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i hookahi ahupuaa, o Hihiu nui, he wahi ahupuaa no ia e waiho ana ma Kohala. A noho ae la o Kapaihiahilina ma ka noho kuhina nui, imi ae la na luna malalo ona i hewa no Kapaihiahilina. Ua loaa no ka hewa, he hewa nui no, aka, no ka punahele nui launa ole no, nolaila, aole e manao ana o Lonoikamakahiki he hewa ia no Kapaihiahilina.","After the installation of Kapaihiahilina as premier for Lonoikamakahiki, he was awarded the ahupuaa called Hihiu nui, the same being located at Kohala. Kapaihiahilina having been inducted into the office of premier, his subordinate officers began to immediately entrap him into some offense. One was found, and a most serious one, but being a very great favorite of Lonoikamakahiki’s the king was loath to entertain any wrong in Kapaihiahilina."
"A no ka hewa ole o Kapaihiahilina ma na mea o ke alii, imi hou ae la na luna malalo ona i mea e hewa ai. Nolaila, loaa ae la ka hewa o Kapaihiahilina ma ka moekolohe ana me Kaikilani ka Lonoikamakahiki wahine ponoi, mamuli o ka hooweawea ia e na luna nana e imihala nei.

A nolaila, hai ia aku la ia Lonoikamakahiki keia hewa ana o Kapaihiahilina me Kaikilani. Aka i ko Lonoikamakahiki lohe ana i keia mea, aole ia he hewa i ko ke alii manao.","As no incriminating charges could be brought against Kapaihiahilina that would be entertained by the king, the inferior officers made greater efforts to convict him. They finally brought the charge against him of having had illicit intercourse with Kaikilani, the wife of Lonoikamakahiki, brought about principally by the acts of the subordinate officers themselves who studiously prepared the conspiracy. The inferior officers being aware of the illicit relations between Kapaihiahilina and Kaikilani and knowing that it was such an offense from which he could not escape, the conspirators placed the information before Lonoikamakahiki, who upon hearing of it set it aside as being unworthy of his royal attention."
"A no ka loaa ole o ko Kapaihiahilina hewa, ma keia mau mea, imua o ke alii, alaila, ua maopopo i ua mau luna nei, ua pakela loa ka punahele o Kapaihiahilina, nolaila hoopau ae la ua mau luna nei i ko lakou manao imihala. [ ]","Being unable to implicate Kapaihiahilina in these matters it dawned upon the conspiring officers that Kapaihiahilina was indeed a highly honored favorite of the king, so they gave up conspiring. [ ]"
"Hookahi paha makahiki o Kapaihiahilina ma ka noho kuhina nui, alaila holo aku la oia i Kauai, me ka manao no e hoi hou mai ma kona noho kuhina nui. I kela manawa o Kapaihiahilina i Kauai, manao ae la ke alo alii e imihala hou i mea e hewa ai o Kapaihiahilina ma kona noho kuhina nui, mai ka punahele ae a Lonoikamakahiki.

Whilst he was absent on Kauai the king’s suite renewed their conspiracy to implicate him in some trouble in his capacity as prime minister and as a favorite of Lonoikamakahiki. The chiefs immediately around the sovereign brought all manner of accusations of the most contemptuous description against Kapaihiahilina and the idea entered the king’s mind that he should be dismissed from his ministerial position as well as losing his place as a favorite."
"A hoohiki iho la o Lonoikamakahiki i olelo paa aole e ike hou i na maka o Kapaihiahilina. Mamuli o na olelo akiaki a ke alo alii, pau ae la ka punahele nui o Kapaihiahilina ia Lonoikamakahiki.",Lonoikamakahiki then made a solemn pledge that he would not again see the face of Kapaihiahilina. Through the subtle machinations of the royal suite the high esteem of Lonoikamakahiki for Kapaihiahilina ceased.
"Ma ia noho ana o Kapaihiahilina i Kauai, aole i liuliu, hiki aku ka lohe ia Kapaihiahilina, ua pau kona punahele, a me kona noho kuhina nui ana. Nolaila, holo mai la o Kapaihiahilina i Hawaii, i ike aku ai oia i ka pau io ana o kona punahele.

To verify what he had heard relative to his dismissal he sailed for Hawaii. Whilst on the voyage to Hawaii on his canoes he commenced the composition of a song wherein was recited his travels with Lonoikamakahiki in the mountain glens, their escapes from dangers of many descriptions. On the way, he first landed at Kohala, as he desired to see the land which had been given him. Upon arriving there he found that a new konohiki had been installed on the land and the one placed there by him had been dismissed. It was then that he realized his downfall. He set sail for Kona to fully acquaint himself with the commands of the king."
"Ia manawa, e noho ana o Lonoikamakahiki ma Kahaluu, no ka mea, he kapu heiau kana ia wa. A i ka hiki ana aku o Kapaihiahilina mawaho o Kahaluu, ike muaia mai la o Kapaihiahilina ma na waa.

When he came in sight immediately outside of Kahaluu, he was recognized at once by his canoes. In consequence thereof, Lonoikamakahiki immediately gave orders that the doors of the house be closed. The doors were not, however, closed at once. At the time the canoes reached the shore and Kapaihiahilina commenced wending his way to the king, when nearing the fencing of the house the doors shut. Kapaihiahilina observing the door closing on him stood outside the fence where the sentinels stood. Raising his voice on high he described in chant their wanderings:"
"A pau ka Kapaihiahilina kahea ana ia Lonoikamakahiki ma ke mele, alaila huli hoi aku la oia, me ka uwe pu i ke aloha i ke alii, a kau iluna o na waa, a holo aku la. I ka manawa i pau ae ai ka Kapaihiahilina kahea ana i ka inoa o Lonoikamakahiki, a mahope iho, kupu mai la ko Lonoikamakahiki aloha no Kapaihiahilina, no kona hoalohaloha ana mai, ma ke ano o ka laua pili ana, a me ko laua hele ana.

Aka, i ka wehe ana ae o ke pani o ka hale alii, aia o Kapaihiahilina e holo ana mawaho o Laaloa.","At the end of Kapaihiahilina’s greetings to Lonoikamakahiki in the chant he retraced his footsteps whence he had come, weeping with affection for the king. Boarding his canoes he sailed away. After Kapaihiahilina had ceased his dedicated chant of Lonoikamakahiki’s name the ancient love surged within his bosom for the loving tribute, the story of their companionship and their wanderings. It was very evident [ ] that Kapaihiahilina’s composition was founded on facts. Lonoikamakahiki then ordered the doors of his royal abode to be opened to allow Kapaihiahilina to enter the house. On opening the door of the royal mansion, however, Kapaihiahilina was then outside of Laaloa sailing away."
"A i ka ike ana o Lonoikamakahiki, e holo ana o Kapaihiahilina, alaila hoouna aku la oia i na elele, e kii aku ia Kapaihiahilina. A i ke kii ana o na elele mamuli o ka olelo a ke alii, a halawai aku la me Kapaihiahilina, me ka olelo aku: “I kii mai nei makou ia oe e hoi; ua hoouna mai nei ia makou e olelo aku ia oe e hoi, no ka mea, ua nui loa ke aloha o ke alii ia oe i ko kaukau ana ae ma ke mele, e like me ka olua hele ana; haalele aku la makou, aia no ke alii (Lonoikamakahiki) ke uwe la.”","Lonoikamakahiki observing that Kapaihiahilina had sailed away, sent messengers to get him to return. The messengers, in conformity with the king’s desire, set forth and upon reaching Kapaihiahilina said to him: “We come for you to return; we were sent to beseech you to come back; the king is overwhelmed with love for you and your appeal for compassion by the chant describing your wanderings; when we left the king was still weeping.”"
"A lohe o Kapaihiahilina i keia leo, alaila olelo aku la oia i na elele, me ka i aku: “E hoi olua a i ke alii, e hai aku i kuu aloha iaia, aole au e hoi aku; no ka mea, ua hoolohe aku ia i na olelo a ka poe akiaki o kona alo, malia paha o ua poe la no kekahi i hele pu me ia, a ai i ka pua pala o ka hala o Pooku, a hume pu i ka malo laki, a me ka palai.

O u hoi olua.” A pau ka Kapaihiahilina olelo ana i ua mau luna nei, alaila, hoi aku la laua, a halawai me ke alii (Lonoikamakahiki), a hai aku la i na mea a pau a Kapaihiahilina i olelo mai ai.","Kapaihiahilina hearing what was said, replied to the messengers: “You both return to the king. Give him my love and say, I cannot go back, because he has harkened to the slanderers who surround him. They may be the ones who accompanied him and ate the ripe flowers of the pandanus of Pooku and girded together the ti leaves as well as the ferns. Therefore I am now homeward bound to bury my bones on Kauai’s shore. If I should die it would be of no moment to him, but should it be he who shall pass away, my companion of many perils, I will weep for him alone at Kauai. Both of you go back.” When Kapaihiahilina finished what he had to say to the messengers, they went back, met the king and reported all that Kapaihiahilina had said."
"A ma keia mea a ua mau elele nei i olelo mai ai, he mea pono ole loa ia ia Lonoikamakahiki. A nolaila, hoolale ae la o Lonoikamakahiki i kana mau hoewaa elua, ia Kapahi a me Moanaikaiaiwa, o Kipunuiaiakamau ma, o ke keiki hookama o Kamahualele. A mamua o kona (Lonoikamakahiki) holo ana, kauoha ae la oia ia Kaikilani, Kealiiakalani, Kalanioumi, a me Keakealani: “Eia wau ke hele nei, e noho oukou i ka aina, e nana kekahi o oukou i kekahi, mai kekeue oukou. Ina hoi i hele au a i maliu mai kuu hoa hele ia’u, alaila, hoi mai maua, aka hoi i maliu ole mai kela, alaila, ukali aku no au mamuli ona (Kapaihiahilina), a malia paha o maliu mai i ka ukali loihi ia aku. Oi-e, he makole ka huhu, o hele a ka lihi pepeiao.”","In consequence of the statements made by the messengers Lonoikamakahiki became very much aggrieved. He immediately ordered his two canoe paddlers, Kapahi and Moanaikaiaiwa, also Kipunuiaiakamau and the adopted child of Kamahualele to prepare themselves for the voyage. Prior to Lonoikamakahiki’s sailing he commanded Kaikilani, Kealiiokalani, Kalanioumi and Keakealani thus: “I am about to go; stay on the land; let each of you care for each other and be not envious of one another. If I go and my companion harkens to me, then we will return; but should he listen not, then I will follow him, and by being persistent in my search he may relent, for anger only inflames and reaches the tips of the ears.”"
"A pau ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo ana i keia mau olelo, kau aku la oia iluna o na waa a holo aku la. Ia imi ana a Lonoikamakahiki, halawai aku la oia me Kapaihiahilina ma Anaehoomalu, ma ke kaha, ma ka palena o Kona a me Kohala. A penei no ka moolelo oia imi ana a Lonoikamakahiki.",Lonoikamakahiki having ceased his admonitions went aboard the canoes which awaited him and sailed away. In his search he met Kapaihiahilina at Anaehoomalu at the seashore at the dividing line of Kona and Kohala. Thus runs the tradition concerning Lonoikamakahiki’s search for his companion Kapaihiahilina:
"I ka manawa i imi aku ai o ua o Lonoikamakahiki, ua pae mua aku o Kapaihiahilina i Anaehoomalu a mahope aku lakou nei (Lonoikamakahiki ma). A i ka manawa i ike aku ai o Lonoikamakahiki ia Kapaihiahilina e noho mai ana i kaha one, ma kahi e kau ana na waa o lakou (o Kapaihiahilina ma), alaila, uwe aku la o Lonoikamakahiki, ma ka uwe helu ana, e like me ka laua hele ana. A ike mai la no hoi o Kapaihiahilina i ka uwe helu aku a ke alii, alaila uwe helu mai la no hoi oia. A ia laua i halawai ai, a pau ka laua uwe ana a me ka laua kamailio ana, alaila kau iho la o Lonoikamakahiki i olelo hoohiki mawaena o laua, aole e loaa hou kekahi [ ] kue, aole hoi e hoolohe i na olelo akiaki a kona mau aialo. Aka, i mea e paa io ai ka laua hoohiki, nolaila, kukulu iho la o Lonoikamakahiki i wahi ahu pohaku (heiau), i wahi no laua e pule ai me ka hoohiki imua o ke akua o Lonoikamakahiki, no ka hoopaa ana i ko laua hoohiki ana.","When Lonoikamakahiki set sail on his search for his friend, Kapaihiahilina had already arrived at Anaehoomalu and soon afterwards was followed by Lonoikamakahiki and others. Lonoikamakahiki saw Kapaihiahilina sitting on the sand beach when the canoes were being hauled ashore. Lonoikamakahiki immediately began to wail and also described their previous wanderings together. Kapaihiahilina recognizing the king also commenced wailing. When they came together and had ceased weeping and conversing, then Lonoikamakahiki made a covenant between them, that there would be no more strife, nor would he harken to the voice of slander which surrounds him, and in order that the understanding between them should be made binding, Lonoikamakahiki [ ] built a temple of rocks as a place for the offering of their prayers and the making of oaths to Lonoikamakahiki’s god to fully seal the covenant."
"A ike aku la o Kapaihiahilina ua hooiaio mai o Lonoikamakahiki i kana hoohiki ana, ia manawa ko Kapaihiahilina ae ana aku e hoi me Lonoikamakahiki. A pau ka laua kapu heiau ana malaila, hoi aku laua i Kona, a noho iho la ma Kaawaloa, ma Kona Hema.","Kapaihiahilina observed that Lonoikamakahiki was sincere in his desires and at that moment gave his consent to return with Lonoikamakahiki. After their religious observance at this place they returned to Kona and resided at Kaawaloa, in South Kona."
"(Ua oleloia ma ka moolelo o ko laua hana ana i olelo hoohiki no ke kukulu ana i ke ahu pohaku ma Anaehoomalu, ua kapaia ka inoa o ia palena mawaena o Kohala a me Kona “O Keahualono”; o ka inoa mau ia oia wahi a hiki mai i keia manawa; oia hoi ke kukulu ana o Lonoikamakahiki i ahu pohaku).","(Tradition says because of the covenant entered into for the erection of the mound of rocks at Anaehoomalu, the boundary between Kohala and Kona was named Keahualono, and that place has been known ever since by that name signifying the erection of a mound of rocks by Lonoikamakahiki.)"
"A i ka hoi ana o Lonoikamakahiki me Kapaihiahilina, noho hou iho la o Kapaihiahilina ma kona noho kuhina nui e like me ka noho mua ana. A mahope mai o ko Kapaihiahilina noho kuhina hou ana, alaila, kukakuka ae la o Kapaihiahilina me Lonoikamakahiki, i mea e kaawale aku ai ka poe nana i niania wale ia Kapaihiahilina mai ke alo alii aku.

Aka, ua ninau aku o Lonoikamakahiki i ko Kapaihiahilina manao no ka poe nana i niania wale oia, ina paha o ka make ko Kapaihiahilina makemake, oia no; alaila, o ko Lonoikamakahiki makemake no ia. A ina o ke kipaku ko Kapaihiahilina makemake, alaila pela no, o ko Lonoikamakahiki manao no ia. E like me ka Kapaihiahilina mea e koi ai, malaila aku no o Lonoikamakahiki.","After Lonoikamakahiki and Kapaihiahilina had returned home he resumed the office of premier as formerly. After his reinstatement to his former position a conference was held between him and the king as to how to get rid of the slanderers of Kapaihiahilina from the royal presence. It is stated that Kapaihiahilina had refused to return to Kona with Lonoikamakahiki at the time they met at Anaehoomalu, the exact conversation running as follows: “I will not return with you again until those who slandered me be got rid of from your presence; then only will I return with you.” By reason of this the conference was held. Lonoikamakahiki sought the wishes of Kapaihiahilina as to what disposition should be made of his slanderers, whether they should be slain, and if that, it was agreeable to him also. Should Kapaihiahilina express the desire to banish them, Lonoikamakahiki would acquiesce to that also. Lonoikamakahiki was bent on satisfying Kapaihiahilina’s every wish."
"A nolaila, ma kela kuka ana a laua ma keia mau mea, ua hooholo ko Kapaihiahilina manao, e pau i ka make ka poe nana i niania aku. Aka hoi, i mea e pau ai ko lakou make mainoino ana ma ka pepehi maoli aku, nolaila, ua waihoia ko lakou make maloko o ke kaua ana. A pau iho la ka poe nana i niania wale ia Kapaihiahilina i ka make. A mahope iho o ia manawa, kau pono iho la o Kapaihiahilina ma kona noho punahele ana, ma ka aoao kuhina nui a hiki i kona make ana.","At the conference stated for the consideration of this matter Kapaihiahilina decided to put to death those who had slandered him. In order to mitigate the horrible death which the slanderers would meet, by actual killing, it was decided that they should die in war. In this manner were the slanderers put out of existence. Kapaihiahilina ever after became firmly entrenched as a favorite, and he acted as premier even up to the time of his death."
"Ma ia hope mai a hiki i ko Lonoikamakahiki make ana, aole he mau kaua ana, aole no hoi he kipi, he maikai wale no. A hala o Lonoikamakahiki i ka make, ua oleloia, ua lilo ke Aupuni o Hawaii ia Keakealani.

After Lonoikamakahiki’s death it is said that the kingdom of Hawaii became the patrimony of Keakealani, and from his reign on to that of the successive kings until the time of Kamehameha, we are told by tradition that no great wars ever again took place. During the reign of Keoua, however, the several district chiefs rebelled. [ ]"

The name of Kualii is omitted in the genealogical records of the chiefs, but his history and doings have often been spoken of. It is told that Kualii was once king of these islands, and in one of his characters he was known to have possessed certain knowledge from a god, and at times even assumed the real attributes of a supernatural being."
"He alii kaulana o Kualii, no ka ikaika a me ke koa; ua lanakila mau oia iloko o na hoouka kaua maluna o kona poe enemi; a ua kaulana oia no kona puni kaua. Ua oleloia o Kualii, ua hoomaka kona kaua mai ka manawa kamalii mai a hiki i kona hoomakua ana.

A e like me ka makemake o Kualii, a pela i hana aku ai kona mau kanaka.","Kualii was a celebrated chief and noted for his strength and bravery; he was known to have won all the battles fought by him, defeating his enemies every time. He was also known for his great desire for war. It is said of Kualii that he began fighting battles in his childhood and so continued until he reached manhood. The following story exhibits some of the extraordinary traits in the character of this man."
"A i ka hoouka kaua ana o Kualii ia Oahu nei me na ’lii o Koolauloa mai, i ka manawa mahope mai o ko Kakuhihewa noho alii ana no Oahu nei, a i ole ia, i ka manawa paha mamua aku o ko Kakuhihewa noho alii ana, (aole nae i maopopo ka manawa).

A penei ka moolelo no ia hoouka kaua ana i hoopau wale ai.","When he was well advanced in life and unable to walk, he ordered his servants to make him a network of strings (koko). And in accordance with the wish of Kualii his servants proceeded to carry it out. In the engagement of Kualii here on Oahu, against the chiefs from Koolauloa, sometime after the reign of Kakuhihewa over Oahu, or possibly at a time prior to the reign of Kakuhihewa (the exact time not being very clearly ascertained), which engagement was to be upon the plains of Keahumoa at Honouliuli, Ewa, he was carried by his men in a network of strings. No actual fighting occurred, however, as the two armies upon coming together entered into a declaration of peace. The number of men under Kualii in this contest was three mano, which is equal to twelve thousand, and the number of men comprising the other army was three lau, which is equal to twelve hundred; and the reason why the battle was not fought is told in the following story."
"O Kapaahulani ka mua, a o kona kaikaina o Kamakaaulani, he mau kanaka imi haku laua, a na laua i haku i mele, a holo, hooili i ka inoa no Kualii.

A penei ka laua olelo kuka hope, oiai o laua wale.","Kapaahulani the elder and his younger brother Kamakaaulani were men who were in search of a new master or lord, so they composed a mele, or chant, and after it was completed placed it to Kualii as his name. Shortly after the two men had completed [ ] the mele they held a conference as to the proper course for them to follow in order that they might both reap equal benefit. Following is how they decided which course to pursue while all by themselves and before the mele was made public: “Since we have composed and completed this mele, you (Kamakaaulani) must therefore go and give its name to Kualii, and I (Kapaahulani) will go to the other chief and urge him to make war upon Kualii. And when we become acquainted of the place where the battle is to be fought then you are to take Kualii to the place and there conceal yourselves in the bushes. You are to leave a mark on the road, however, so that I may be informed of your being there. I will then stand and chant this mele that we have just composed.” After completing their arrangement, Kamakaaulani gave out the mele which was known as the name of Kualii. Some considerable time after this, these two brothers again got together and decided upon the time when they should bring about what they had agreed upon. The following is what they said at this last meeting while by themselves:"
"Kamakaaulani: “E hele oe a ke alii o Koolauloa, lawe mai oe, a ma ke kula o Keahumoa, malaila makou e pee ai, alaila, i hele mai oukou, a i ike oe i ka lai i nipuu ia, a me ka hiu ia aholehole e waiho ana maluna o ka puu ainako, alaila, e manao oe, o makou ia, alaila, e ku ae no oe a kahea ae i ua mele la. Aia nae a hiki i na po i o Kane a ao ae, e loaa no makou ma ke kula o Keahumoa.” A holo ka laua olelo, alaila, hele aku la o Kapaahulani e launa me ke alii o Koolauloa. I kekahi manawa o Kapaahulani ma Waialua, oiai e noho ana ke alii o Koolauloa malaila ia manawa, hoolauna aku la o Kapaahulani i ke alii, me ke koi aku e kii e kaua ia Kualii.","Kamakaaulani: “You go to the chief of Koolauloa and bring him to the plains of Keahumoa where we will conceal ourselves. When you see a knotted ti leaf and the tail of a small fish (aholehole) on a pile of sugar-cane peelings, then remember that it is the sign that we are there and you can stand on that spot and chant the mele. This must, however, be on the eve of Kane. You will find us on the plains of Keahumoa.” As soon as this was agreed upon, Kapaahulani proceeded on his way to meet the chief of Koolauloa. When Kapaahulani reached Waialua where the chief of Koolauloa had come and was residing for the time being, soon after his arrival there he introduced himself to the chief, and thereupon urged him to go and make war on Kualii."
"I kekahi ahiahi, i na kahuna a ke alii e nana ana i na ouli o ka lani, i mea e maopopo ai ko lakou lanakila ana maluna o Kualii, aka, i ka nana ana a na kahuna kilokilo lani, ua maopopo, aole e lanakila ana ko lakou puali maluna o Kualii. A lohe aku la o Kapaahulani i keia olelo a na kahuna a ke alii o Koolau, alaila olelo aku la oia i kekahi kamaaina e pili ana i ke alii: “E hele oe a ke alii, e hai aku oe i ka’u olelo ua lalau ka ike a na kahuna a ke alii.” A no keia olelo a Kapaahulani, alaila, laweia aku la ka lohe o keia olelo imua o ke alii, a hai ia aku la me ka i aku nae: “E ke alii, ua olelo mai nei kela kanaka (Kapaahulani) ua lalau ka ike a na kahuna au.” I mai la ke alii: “E kii oe i ua kanaka la, e hele mai e olelo i kana mea i kamailio mai nei ia oe.”","On a certain evening while the priests and the chief were watching the heavens in order to discover if they could defeat Kualii, the astrologers, after a careful study, were certain that their army would not be able to overcome the army of Kualii. When Kapaahulani heard the decision arrived at by the priests of the chief of Koolauloa, he remarked to one of the chief’s attendants: “You go to the chief and tell him for me that his priests are mistaken in their interpretations.” Upon hearing this remark made by Kapaahulani, the man went and said to the chief: “O Chief, that man (Kapaahulani) has just said that your priests are mistaken in their interpretations.” The chief replied: “You go and bring that man to me. Let him come and say what he has told you.”"
"Alaila, kiiia aku la o Kapaahulani, a laweia mai la imua o ke alii, ninau aku la: “He oiaio anei, ua olelo mai nei oe, ua lalau ka ike a kuu mau kahuna?” I aku la o Kapaahulani i ke alii: “Ae, he oiaio, ua lalau ka ike a ko mau kahuna; aka, ma ko’u ike ma ko’u ano kahuna nui, e like me ka mea i aoia ia’u mai ko’u mau kupuna mai a hiki ia’u, he lalau io no ka ike a ua mau kahuna nei a ke alii.” [ ] A no keia mea, olelo aku la ke alii ia Kapaahulani: “Pehea hoi kau ike? E pono ke olelo mai.” Olelo aku la o Kapaahulani i ke alii: “O ka’u ike, ina e kii kakou e kaua ia Kualii, alaila, e lanakila no kakou maluna o ia kaua. Ke manao nei wau, ina e kii kakou i ka la apopo ia Kualii, a i halawai kakou me ke kaua i ka ehu kakahiaka, hoomoe wale ke kaua i ke awakea. A ina hoi i halawai kakou me ke kaua i ke awakea, alaila, hee ia kakou i ka ehu ahiahi.”","Kapaahulani was then sent for and he was brought in the presence of the chief, who asked him: “Is it true that you have said that my priests are mistaken in their interpretations?” Kapaahulani replied to the chief: “Yes, it is true your priests are [ ] mistaken in their interpretations; because according to what I have seen, being also a great priest, and in accordance with the knowledge gathered by my ancestors and handed to me by them, your priests have indeed made a mistake in their interpretations to you, O Chief.” Upon hearing this the chief asked Kapaahulani: “What are your interpretations then? It is proper that you relate them.” Kapaahulani then replied to the chief: “My interpretations are these: If we go and make war upon Kualii, we will be victorious in that battle. I believe that if we could go and make war upon Kualii tomorrow, and it should happen that we meet him in the early morning, that by noon the battle would not be fought; but if we happen to meet his army at noon time we would defeat him early in the evening.”"
"A no keia mea, hoolale ae la ke alii i na puali koa he ekolu lau (umi kumamalua haneri), ka nui o na koa, e hoomakaukau no ka hele i ke kaua. Ma ia po, hele ae la lakou a uka o Lihue, a malaila mai a iho i Honouliuli, a hiki lakou i ke kula o Keahumoa, oia ka hoomaka ana mai a ka la e puka.

Nolaila, e kuu ae wau i kuu pule a i maikai kuu pule i keia kakahiaka, pakele kakou, aka, i kuu wau i kuu pule, a i ino kuu pule i keia la, pau kakou i ka make.”","Because of these remarks, the chief thereupon ordered his men, amounting to three lau (twelve hundred) to get ready to go to war. That night they went to the upper part of Lihue, and from there on down to Honouliuli, till they arrived on the plains of Keahumoa, just as the sun was coming up. At this same time Kapaahulani saw the mark agreed upon by him and his brother. He then rushed to the front of the army to the chief warriors and spoke to the people in the chief’s immediate circle as follows: “Say, Nuunewa (the chief warrior), we are surrounded by the enemy. I had thought that we would be the victors if we arrived here first, but I see that we are surrounded. Therefore I will chant my prayer, and if it should be acceptable this morning, we will be saved; but if I chant my prayer and it should end badly this day, then we will all be killed.”"
"A no keia olelo a Kapaahulani, olelo ko’a mai la na kahuna o ke alii me ka i mai: “He mea kupanaha! Olelo mai nei hoi oe ia kakou, aole kakou e puni ana i ke kaua, na kakou ke kaua e hiki mua ma keia wahi; eia ka hoi, ua puni iho nei kakou i ke kaua.”","Because of these remarks spoken by Kapaahulani, the chief’s priests spoke up saying: “It does seem strange. You told us that we would not be surrounded by the enemy, and that we would be victorious if we were to reach this place first; but it now turns out that we are surrounded by the enemy.”"
"I mai ke alii: “Ua oki ka oukou olelo, ua kuu ae nei kakou i ke ola, a me ka make o ka puali ia ia nei. Nolaila e pono paha kakou e hoolohe i ka ia nei olelo. A ina he oiaio ka ia nei e olelo nei, ua puni ka kakou i ke kaua, alaila o kona pono no hoi ia a me kona waiwai; aka, he wahahee na ia nei, alaila, eia kuu olelo paa maluna o ia nei: e make ia nei, a make mai me kona hanauna, o ka ohi no ia o ka make a hiki i kona poe hoaikane mai.”","The chief then spoke up: “Stop your remarks. We have staked the life and death of the army in his keeping, therefore we must abide by what he says. If what he says is true, that we are indeed surrounded by the enemy, then it will redound to his own good, and he shall be rewarded. But in case he lies and is deceiving us, then my firm command as to his treatment is this: he shall die, and all his relations also, and death shall gather up even those who befriend him.”"
"Ia manawa, ku ae la o Kapaahulani imua o ka huakai, a pule aku la, ma ke mele a laua i haku ai me kona kaikaina. [ ]",Kapaahulani then stood up in the presence of the army and prayed by chanting the mele composed by him and his brother. [ ]
"I loko o keia wa a Kapaahulani e heluhelu la i keia pauku, i mai la ka pukaua o Kualii iaia: “E apa ana kakou i keia kaua i ke aha? Kai noa he hoouka ae ka kakou i keia wahi kaua uuku.” Ia manawa olelo aku o Kamakaaulani, ke kaikaina o Kapaahulani, i ka pukaua: “E kali paha ka hoouka o ke kaua, ke loaa mai la hoi ka [ ] inoa o ke alii; nolaila e pono kakau ke kali aku; ina i hana mai kela i ko Kualii mau kupuna mai ka po mai a hiki ia ianei (Kualii) alaila e hookuu aku, aole e kaua.” A e like me ka olelo a Kamakaaulani, pela no o Kualii i hoolohe ai. Aka, o Kapaahulani, aole oia i hooki i kana hana ana i keia mele, ka mea i kapaia he pule.","While Kapaahulani was chanting this section of the mele Kualii’s chief officer remarked to the king: “Why are we delaying this battle? Why not let us fight out this small battle?” Kamakaaulani, the brother of Kapaahulani, then spoke to the chief officer: “Let us perhaps delay the battle. I hear the king’s name is being mentioned; [ ] therefore it is but proper that we wait. If he can rightly name Kualii’s ancestors from the beginning right down to him (Kualii), then we should let them go, and there will be no fighting.” Kualii, by his silence, showed that he would abide by the words spoken by Kamakaaulani. In the meantime Kapaahulani continued on with his chanting of the mele, called a prayer."
"I keia manawa, a Kapaahulani i hea ai: “E ku mai oe i ka hea, i ka ualo, mai hookuli mai oe.” Ma keia kaukau ana, ia manawa ku mai la o Kualii me ka paa i ke koko; na Kualii i ku mai, hele pu mai la me na koa o na aoao elua o ko Kualii puali no; i nana aku auanei ke kaua o Koolauloa mai, aole i kana mai a ka nui o ke kaua a Kualii. Ia manawa, iniki aku, iniki mai ka puali o Koolauloa mai, me ka olelo iho: “Ike wale ke kahuna; eia ka ua puni io kakou i ke kaua.” Alaila ia wa, ke nalu la na pukaua o ko Koolauloa kaua mai i ka pilikia.","When Kapaahulani reached that portion in his chant where it says, “Stand forth at the call, at the pleading; turn not a deaf ear,” Kualii was raised up while still in the netting. As he was being held up, the soldiers of the two wings of his army also stood up. When the warriors from Koolauloa looked about them and saw that Kualii had a very large army, they nudged back and forth and remarked to one another: “The priest is indeed wise; here we are indeed surrounded by the enemy.” At this same time the chief warriors of the Koolauloa army were thinking of the trouble they had gotten into."
"I kela manawa a Kualii e amo ia la iloko o ke koko, aole nae i hooki o Kapaahulani i kona kahea ana i ka inoa o Kualii, nokamea, o kana kahea ana mai no mai kinohi mai, o kana hea iho la no ia me ka hoomaha ole a hiki i ka hui ana o na kaua elua. Ia Kualii i kela manawa, hea mai la o Kapaahulani ma ka hoohalike ana ia Kualii i mea e like ai, aole nae he mea e like ai. Aka, o ka mea i like ai o Kualii ma ka hoohalike ana, o Keaweikekahialiiokamoku ke alii o Hawaii. Nokamea, ua oleloia, he akua o Kualii. Ina e hele o Kualii mai Kahaluu aku a hiki i Waialua, maloko o ke kai, alaila maloo ke kohola.","While Kualii was being held up in the koko, standing amidst his warriors, Kapaahulani still kept on chanting the mele of Kualii, never once stopping to rest, from the time he began it until both armies met. When Kapaahulani saw Kualii he endeavored to find some one with whom he could compare Kualii, but try as he would he was unable to find any one worthy of comparison except Keaweikekahialiiokamoku, the king of Hawaii. The reason of this was because Kualii was compared to a god. When Kualii walked from Kahaluu to Waialua by way of the sea, the sea within the reef would dry up."
"A o Keaweikekahialiiokamoku hoi, ina e holo oia me kona mau kanaka i ka lawaia, a ina i makewai na hoewaa, alaila, olelo aku ia Keawe: “E! makewai makou.” Alaila ukuhi ae la na hoewaa i ke kai iloko o ka waa, alaila hoi ala mai la hoi o Keawe, mai luna mai o ka pola o na waa a noho i ka noho-ana, hoolei loa na wawae iloko o ke kaina liu, alaila, ua manalo koke ke kai, a lilo iho la i wai no na hoewaa; pela i lilo ai o Kualii i mea like me Keaweikekahialiiokamoku.","Keaweikekahialiiokamoku, on the other hand, when out fishing with his men and ran out of water would turn salt water into fresh. When his paddlers became thirsty they would tell Keawe: “Say, we are thirsty.” The paddlers would then dip up the sea and pour it into the canoe, and Keawe would get up from the covered seat between the two canoes and sit in one of the seats; then he would stretch out his legs in the sea water that had been poured into the canoe, and the sea water would lose its saltness and become fresh, and the paddlers would then use it for drinking purposes. This was the reason why Kualii was compared to Keaweikekahialiiokamoku."

Fornander refers to it in his Polynesian Race, Vol. II, p. 284, but does not append it in his republication of the song, with a somewhat different interpretation as an Appendix in said Volume II, from the fact that he questioned its genuineness. Not doubting his judgment in the case, it serves here as a further tribute, at a later period possibly, to the name and fame of Kualii by a historian of his race.— Ed. ]"

The king of Koolauloa then gave over, or ceded, the districts of Koolauloa, Koolaupoko, Waialua and Waianae. When the king of Kauai heard how Kualii excelled over all the others in war, and how he had gained the victory at the battle of Honouliuli on the plains of Keahumoa, he came to meet Kualii and gave him Kauai, and by this act Kualii became possessed of all the islands from Hawaii to Niihau.

After the presents were loaded into several large double canoes, they were sent out to meet Kamakaaulani who was then at Puuloa, and there the presents were given him."
"A o Kamakaaulani hoi, mamua o ko laua hookaawale ana ia laua, ua kuka mua no laua i kahi e noho ai o Kamakaaulani, mahope iho o ka hoomoe ana o ke kaua; a nolaila no i noho ai o Kamakaaulani ma Puuloa, mamuli o ka laua kuka mua ana.

This was why Kamakaaulani resided at Puuloa, that being the place agreed upon by them. Thus by this conduct of theirs both sides were deceived through their duplicity."
"Ia Kapaahulani i hoi ai me ke alii i Waialua mahope iho o ka haalele ana ia Waianae, i aku la ke alii ia Kapaahulani: “Pehea na aina a’u i haawi aku ai ia oe i ka la i hoomoe ai ke kaua i kula o Keahumoa?” I aku la o Kapaahulani: “E ke alii, aole o’u manao aina, aole no hoi kekahi mea e ae.

I do not care for the lands nor for anything else. The only thing I want you to give me is to have the general care of your store houses.” When the king saw that Kapaahulani had made the proper answer in the matter, he was thereupon made chief steward over the store houses in the name of the king."
"Alaila, o ka hana a ua Kapaahulani nei, iaia ma ke ano puuku nui no ka halepapaa, o ka hoouna mau i na mea a pau ma ka halepapaa no kona kaikaina no Kamakaaulani.

Uli was the grandmother. Hamakualoa, Maui, was the land in which Kana was born, and Halauoloolo was the name of the house. At the birth of Kana, he was in the form of a piece of rope; he had no human form. After the birth of Kana, Uli took and kept it until it assumed a human form, then she brought the child up. The place where Kana was brought up was in Piihonua, Hilo, Hawaii, a place lying to the East of Wailuku, where his house was built, called Halauoloolo."
"O keia puu o Haupu, he puu ia aia i Molokai; o ke ’lii o luna o ua puu la, o Kapepeekauila ka inoa, o ke kahuna o Moi.

Pane mai o Kana: “Heaha kau?” Olelo aku o Hakalanileo: “I hele mai nei au e hai aku ia oe, ua lilo ka makuahine o olua ia Kapepeekauila, ke ’lii o ka puu o Haupu, aia i Molokai kahi i noho ai i keia wa.”","This hill called Haupu, was a hill situated on Molokai and the chief who lived on this hill was Kapepeekauila by name and his chief priest was known by the name of Moi. Once upon a time this hill, Haupu, moved or floated to Mokuola in Hilo, Hawaii, carrying along the chief and the people and the things that grew on the hill. When Hina the mother of Kana and Niheu saw that the land was pleasant to the eye, she climbed on up the hill with the idea of taking a look at the place. As soon as Hina was on the hill of Haupu, it immediately moved back to Molokai, thus leaving Hakalanileo to mourn for her loss. When Hakalanileo saw that his wife was being carried away he tried to recover her, but found it impossible to do so. After his failure, he proceeded to Niheu and informed him that Hina had been taken away by the hill of Haupu. When Niheu heard this report from his father, he said: “I cannot get her, there is only one person who can do it, and that is Kana. You must go to him personally; don’t be afraid of him and run away if he should turn and look at you. Just [ ] keep your eyes away from him.” After Niheu had given these instructions to Hakalanileo, Hakalanileo turned and went to meet Kana. When Hakalanileo came to where Kana was living, Kana turned and looked at him and the sight of Kana was so terrible that he turned and attempted to run away; but Kana called out to him, saying: “What do you want?” Hakalanileo replied: “I have come to tell you that the mother of you two has been taken away by Kapepeekauila, the chief of the hill of Haupu. She is now at Molokai.”"
"A lohe o Kana, olelo mai la ia ia Hakalanileo: “O hoi e kukala ia Hawaii a puni, e kalai i mau waa no kakou e holo ai i Molokai, i loaa ko wahine.” Ma keia olelo o Kana, ua akoakoa na kalai waa o Hawaii a puni, he mau waa nunui, he umi ka loa; a makaukau na waa, kii aku la o Hakalanileo ia Kana e holo i Molokai. Ia wa, kikoo na lima o Kana a luna o na waa, o ke komo iho la no ia o na waa a poho i lalo, aole i ee ke kino o Kana. Nolaila, olelo hou o Kana ia Hakalanileo, e kalai hou na waa; kalai hou no o Hawaii a puni, a loaa elua waa, i na lima no o Kana komo, nolaila, aohe waa e holo ai i Molokai. Nolaila, hele aku la o Hakalanileo i mua o Niheu a olelo aku la no keia mau mea, a lohe o Niheu, olelo mai la: “O hele a ia Uli, olelo aku i waa; aia ia ia ka waa e hiki ai i Molokai, nana e kuhikuhi mai ia oe.”","When Kana heard this, he said to Hakalanileo: “Go and issue a call that the people come together throughout Hawaii, and instruct the men to go and hew out canoes, by which we will get to Molokai, and get back your wife.” With this, the canoe hewers all around Hawaii came together and a large double canoe of ten [fathoms] in length was hewed out and made ready, whereupon Hakalanileo went for Kana to voyage to Molokai. When Kana came to the double canoe he stretched out his hands and placed them on the canoe and the canoe sunk out of sight; Kana did not even attempt to board the canoe. Because of this, Kana said to Hakalanileo: “Go and hew out another double canoe.” Again the people of Hawaii went up and hewed out another double canoe; but the hands of Kana alone were too much for the canoe, for it too sunk out of sight, thus leaving them without a canoe to get to Molokai in. Therefore, Hakalanileo went to the presence of Niheu and reported the matter to him. When Niheu heard this, he said: “You go to Uli and ask for a canoe; she has the canoe that will take you to Molokai, and she will direct you what to do.”"
"A hiki o Hakalanileo i mua o Uli, ninau mai la Uli: “Heaha kau?” I aku o Hakalanileo: “I hele mai nei au i waa no Kana, e holo ai i Molokai, e kaua me Kapepeekauila, ke ’lii o luna o ka puu o Haupu.” I mai o Uli: “Ae, he waa, aia i Paliuli; e hele nae oe e kukala i na kanaka a pau loa, e kii e kauo mai i na waa.” Hele aku la o Hakalanileo e kukala i na kanaka a pau loa, a akoakoa, he mau lau kanaka ewalu. Ia wa, pii lakou a hiki i uka o Paliuli. Hooulu o Uli i kana mele pule no na waa o Kana.","When Hakalanileo came in the presence of Uli, she asked him: “What is it you want?” Hakalanileo replied: “I have come for a canoe for Kana by which he may be able to get to Molokai to fight Kapepeekauila, the chief that lives on the Haupu hill.” Uli made reply: “Yes, there is a canoe, it is in Paliuli; but you must, however, go and call all the people together to go and drag down the canoes.” Hakalanileo did so and collected eight times forty men, and they proceeded to the uplands of Paliuli, where Uli prayed for a double canoe for Kana."
"A pau ka hooulu ana a Uli, ia wa, olelo o Uli, e kohi i lalo o ka lepo; kohi iho la na kanaka me ka hoomaauea, me ka manao ole he oiaio ka Uli olelo. Ia lakou e kohi ana ike mua ae lakou i ka manu o na waa e hoea ae ana mai ka lepo ae.

The men then began to dig without any interest thinking there was no truth in the words of Uli. While the people were digging they came, first upon the sticks at the bow and stern of the canoe, the points that first came to their view, and when the body of the double canoe and all the parts were exposed, Uli gave orders that the people may return, for they were shivering with the cold, from the rain and thunder which had continued all through the time occupied in the digging, so that they were exhausted."
"A hoi na kanaka a pau loa, alaila, hapai ke ’kua i na waa, ia Kaumaielieli a lana i loko o ke kai, lawe mai la a hiki ma Kaipalaoa, e kupono ana i Wailuku a me Piihonua, kahi o Kana e noho ana.","After the people had all returned, the double canoe, Kaumaielieli, was then lifted by the gods and carried down and placed in the sea; and from this point it was taken to Kaipalaoa, directly below Wailuku and Piihonua, where Kana was living."
"Ia Kana a me Niheu e makaukau ana e holo mai maluna o na waa o Kaumaielieli, e kaua me Kapepeekauila ke ’lii o luna o ka puu a Haupu, ua loaa mua ia Moi ka moe uhane mamua o ka holo ana mai o Kana ma i Molokai.

Iloko o na po o Kane, loaa ia ia ka moe uhane, penei ke ano o kana mea i ike ai:","While Kana and Niheu were making their preparations to sail on the double canoe, Kaumaielieli, to do battle with Kapepeekauila, the chief on the top of Haupu hill, Moi dreamed a dream. This dream was before the start was made by Kana for Molokai. Moi was the priest to the chief Kapepeekauila on the top of Haupu hill. He was a very great priest, learned in his profession and was all powerful; his predictions always coming true, whether in the interpretation of dreams or in the foretelling of coming events. In the night of Kane, he dreamed a dream, which was this:"
"MOEUHANE. He kanaka loa, he kanaka poko, He ui-aa-he alaneo, A na maka pa i ka lani, Malu ka honua, Ia Kamauhili e! Hee nei Ku, I ka moe au a ke kahuna.","THE DREAM. A long man, a short man; A stunted youth, a male god. The eyes touched the heaven, The earth was overshadowed. Say Kamauhili, Ku is routed. Such is my dream, the priest."
"A, ao ae, olelo aku o Moi i ke ’lii ia Kapepeekauila: “E, he moe ka’u i ka po nei.” I mai ke ’lii: “E hai mai.” Hai aku la o Moi i ka moe i olelo ia maluna, a pau ka hai ana, wehewehe aku la i ke ano o ka moe, aole nae he manao io o ke ’lii i keia olelo a Moi. Nolaila, olelo aku o Moi i kana olelo wanana ike, i mua o ke ’lii a me na kanaka: “Ina he hoomoloka i ka moe a’u a ke kahuna, he au hulihia kona hope; ina he wahine ke hoomaloka i ka moe a’u a ke kahuna, he mai kona e moe ia, he wahine ia no Kupukupu, o lou ka nuku o Kolea ma, kau ana i luna o Halehuki. He kanaka loihi ka’u i ike, a oia ka mea nana i hahaki na hui o Haupu nei, a helelei aku nei a ku i loko o ke kai, nolaila, e hele oi la honua ka make.”","At daylight the next day, Moi said to the chief, Kapepeekauila: “Say, I had a dream last night.” The chief said: “Tell me what it is.” Moi then told him of the dream as related above. After telling the dream, Moi gave an interpretation of its meaning, but the chief would not believe it. Seeing this, Moi prophesied to the chief and people, saying: “If you are not going to take heed to my warning, the priest, you will surely be dispossessed. If it is a woman that is unbelieving, she shall make a poor marriage, a woman is she of Kupukupu she will be hooked up by the bill of the duck and left on the height of Halihuki. I saw a long man, and it was by him that the borders of Haupu were broken and the hill fell to pieces into the sea; therefore depart now while death is yet at a distance.”"
"Hoole mai o Kapepeekauila: “O oe no ko’u mea e make ai e na kahuna wahahee; aohe mea e pio ai ko’u puu o Haupu nei; a heaha la hoi, ina i make ole kuu puu ma [ ] keia hope aku, alaila, make oe ia’u.” I aku o Moi: “Ae, he nani ia, ua lohe ole ae la no oe i ka’u olelo, a ua paa iho la no oe i kou manao; heaha la hoi, he ala ike ko kahuna, aole e loaa i ka hookolo ia.”","Kapepeekauila refused to take heed of this warning, saying: “You are the one I shall cause to die, you deceiving priest. My hill of Haupu shall never be conquered. However, let it stand; if my hill is not conquered in the coming fight, I will kill you.” [ ] Moi then replied: “Yes, well and good. Since you would not accept my warning and you have made up your mind in the matter, let it be as you will. The paths of the priests are narrow and can never be reached by crawling.”"
"O ko Moi wahi i noho ai a hele, o ka lapalapa pali hikina o Waikolu, e waiho la ma Molokai a hiki i keia la; aia no hoi kona alanui ma ka pali nihinihi lele loa kahi i kau ai, a malalo o laila ke kai hula ana o Waikolu, a ke waiho nei no ia wahi a hiki i keia la.","The place where Moi dwelt and traversed is along the cliff ridge east of Waikolu, Molokai, and can be seen to this day; its pathway is along this steep cliff, below which are the waters of the Waikolu sea, and the place remains to the present time."
"A lohe ke ’lii o Kapepeekauila i keia olelo a Moi, hoouna aku la ia i kana mau kukini mama loa, o Kolea, o Ulili, e lele e nana ia Kana a me Niheu.

When the two came to the harbor of Punahoa, in Hilo, a place adjoining Kaipalaoa, where Kana was then living, Kolea said to Ulili: “Say, let us fly away up high so as to be out of the reach of Kana, and from up there, call out to him.” The two then flew away up high and at a point directly over the place where Kana was sleeping, they called out to Kana. When Kana heard the call he reached up with his hands, while still lying down, but did not catch them, though the effects of the wind caused by the hands of Kana made them swing away in haste, and in doing this they fell down on the hill of Haupu in Molokai. When the two birds came in the presence of Kapepeekauila, they told of the man with such long arms that they reached into the heavens, and that they barely escaped death. When the chief heard the report of the two birds, he sent Kolea and Ulili to go and tell Keauleinakahi, his warrior who had charge of the ocean."
"O Keauleinakahi, he koa ia no Kapepeekauila, ke ’lii o luna o ka puu o Haupu, e hiki ia ia ke hou i ka waa a puka pu, ma kekahi aoao, oia kela auau hou i ka waa a me na mea e ae. Ua kauoha ia ia e hou aku i na waa o Kaumaielieli, ke holo mai mai Hawai mai, a e pepehi ia Kana a me Niheu.","Keauleinakahi was one of the warriors under Kapepeekauila and it could thrust through a canoe with his snout. This fish is to be seen to this day. It has a long sharp snout and can kill a man or wreck a canoe or other object. When the messengers came to Keauleinakahi, they said: “You have been ordered to pierce the double canoe, Kaumaielieli, when it comes from Hawaii and also to kill Kana and Niheu.”"
"A ee o Kana a me Niheu i luna o na waa o Kaumaielieli, a me ko laua makuakane o Hakalanileo, a holo mai la o Kana, ua opeope ia a kau i luna o ka pola o na waa, e like me ka loihi o na waa o Kaumaielieli, pela no ko Kana waiho ana.

Ia ia e makaukau ana e lele mai e hou, ku ana o Niheu me kana laau palau, o Wawaikalani ka inoa, a hahau aku la ia Keauleinakahi, a make iho la ia.","On the day when Kana and Niheu completed their preparations, they boarded the canoe, Kaumaielieli, taking along with them their father Hakalanileo, and set sail. Kana was wrapped up in the form of a large package, and was placed on the platform. The length of the package extended the full length of the double canoe. While they were on their way and had reached a point between Hawaii and Maui, they were met by Keauleinakahi, the warrior of Kapepeekauila, who made an attack on the double canoe, with the intention of breaking it to pieces with his sharp snout. While it was preparing for the attack, Niheu stood up with his war club, Wawaikalani by name; and as Keauleinakahi made the attack, Niheu struck it with his club, killing it."
"Holo mai la lakou a hiki i Waikolu ma Molokai, kahi e ku ana ka puu o Haupu, hekau iho la na waa i waho. Ia lakou e lana pono ana ma waho ae o Waikolu, olokaa ia mai la kekahi pohaku nui mai luna mai o ka puu o Haupu, maluna pono o na waa o Kaumaielieli.

Make kakou!!” Ma keia kahea ana, ua lohe o Kana, lalau ae la kona lima akau a paa i ka pohaku, o ka lima hema, lalau aku la ma ka poina kai, i iliili kia [ ] no ka pohaku i paa; ma keia hana a Kana, ua paa loa ia pohaku i waena o ka pali a hiki i keia la, e waiho la ma ka pali o Waikolu.

Mahope olaila, kii o Niheu i ka makuahine i luna o ka puu o Haupu, mamuli o kona koa a me kona ikaika.","After this encounter the voyage was resumed until they arrived at Waikolu, Molokai, near where the Haupu hill was standing, and here the canoe was moored. While they were mooring the canoe a large rock was rolled down from the hill aimed at the canoe Kaumaielieli. As Kana was lying on the platform of the canoe, one of the people called out, saying: “Say, there comes a large rock! A large rock is coming!! We will be killed! We will be killed!!” At this call Kana heard it, so he reached out his right hand and held the rock, while with the left hand he reached for a small [ ] stone from the beach and placed it under the rock, stopping it from rolling any further. By this action of Kana the rock was stopped right in the middle of the steep cliff; and it is there to this day, on the cliff of Waikolu. This saved Kana and the canoe Kaumaielieli from destruction by the rock. After this Niheu started off for the top of the Haupu hill, to the rescue of his mother, believing that he could do this with his own strength."
"He koa makau ole o Niheu a he koa wiwo ole i ko hai ikaika, a he hiki ia ia ke hoouka kaua me ka lehulehu, me kona kanalua ole. Lalau aku la ia i kana laau palau o Wawaikalani, a hoomoe aku la mai na waa a hiki i ka pali, hele aku la o Niheu maluna.

He was so brave that he oftentimes fought against a whole army, without the least hesitation. When he was ready to start he took up his war club, Wawaikalani, and placing one end of it on the cliff, the other resting on the canoe, he walked ashore upon it. After landing he proceeded to the top of the hill of Haupu, where the chief Kapepeekauila was living, in company with Hina, the mother of Niheu, who was for the time being his wife."
"O Kahonunuimaeleka ka inoa o Haupu, he honu, me na aoao o ka puu o Haupu, ina e upai na hui, alaila, pii ua puu nei i luna a kiekie i ka lani. He pa ma waho o ka puu o Haupu, he pae humu ka inoa, oia ke ki o Koaea a me ka ulei o Nuuhiwa, aole e komo ka makani i loko o ka hale o ke ’lii, o ia o Halehuki. E hili aku ana o Niheu i ka laau palau ana, pau ke ki o Koaea, a me ka ulei o Nuuhiwa, komo ka makani i loko o Halehuki.","The real name of the hill was Kahonunuimaeleka, a turtle, and had flippers on the sides. Whenever these flippers closed the hill would extend up to the heaven. Around this hill was a fence called Paehumu composed of ti-leaf of Koaea and the ulei of Nuuhiwa. These things grew so close together that they served as a windbreak, and no wind could touch the chief’s house, called Halehuki."
"Ia wa ninau ke ’lii o Kapepeekauila: “Ea, heaha keia mea e komo nei ka makani i loko nei?” “He keiki me ka laau palau, nana e hili mai nei ke ki o Koaea, a me ka ulei o Nuuhiwa.” Olelo mai o Hina: “O Niheu, o ke keiki koa a maua; he keiki makau ole keia, make kakou.” I Hina e kamailio ana, hiki ana o Niheu a lalau ia Hina, a lawe aku la. Mamua ae o ka lawe ana o Niheu ia Hina, ua hai aku o Hina ia Kolea laua o Ulili i ko Niheu wahi e ikaika ai, o ia ka wili lauoho o ke poo o Niheu, o Wilikalinoamohalaikaekaeka ka inoa; e lalau a paa ka wili lauoho, alaila, haalele ia’u, pela e nawaliwali ai o Niheu.","When Niheu came up to the fence he beat down the ti-leaf and ulei with his war club, causing the wind to enter Halehuki. As the wind blew into the house, Kapepeekauila asked: “What has caused the wind to enter here?” “There is a boy outside with a war club. He has beaten down the fence.” Hina then spoke up: “It must be Niheu, our brave son. He is without fear. We shall be killed.” While she was speaking, Niheu came in and taking hold of Hina started off with her. Before Niheu came into the house, Hina had told Kolea and Ulili the place wherein the strength of Niheu laid; it being in the strands of his hair, called Wilikalinoamohalaikaekaeka, and at the same time told them to take hold of the strands and pull on them which will cause Niheu to let go of her, for this would cause him to lose his strength."
"A ike o Kolea a me Ulili, ua lilo o Hina, lele iho la laua a paa i ka wili lauoho o Niheu; a ike o Niheu ua paa kona lauoho, haalele iho la ia ia Hina, a hopu iho la i kana laau palau, a hahau ia Kolea ma laua o Ulili; ia ia i lilo ai i laila, holo aku la o Hina a hiki i ka hale, me ke kane o Kapepeekauila.

Ma keia oni ana o Kana, ua hiki i ka lanikuakea, ka lani lipolipo, ua punawelewele nae ke kino o Kana, no ka pololei i ka make a ka ai, a me ka ia.","When Kolea and Ulili saw that Hina was being taken away, they flew and held Niheu by the hair. When Niheu saw that his hair was being held, he let go of Hina, took up his war club and struck at Kolea and Ulili. While he was doing this, Hina ran back to the house, to her new husband Kapepeekauila; Niheu, therefore, walked back to the canoe, and he was questioned by Kana as follows: “How about our mother?” Niheu replied: “I had her and we were on our way here when I was attacked; my hair was pulled by the two birds, Kolea and Ulili. While I was beating them off, Hina ran back again.” Kana then said to Niheu: “You stay here on our canoe while I go after our mother.” With this Kana stood up in the canoe and peeped over the hill of Haupu. At this the hill extended on up and Kana also extended on upward too. In doing this [ ] Kana had to go up to the highest heaven, in the deep blue sky and his body was in the form of a spider’s webb, for he was in great need of food and meat."
"Nolaila, nana ae la o Niheu ma na wawae o Kana, i ka punawelewele a me ka wiwi loa, a noonoo iho la ia, he make pololi.

When Kana heard the call of Niheu, he bent himself over across Molokai, over the top of Haleakala, over the mountain whereby a groove was formed across Haleakala which can be seen to this day."

[ ]","When Kana reached Kona and the home of Uli his grandmother, he laid down by the doorway until Uli awoke in the morning, and when she came out she saw Kana, her grandson. She then woke him up and began feeding him. When Kana was satisfied, the increase of his body began to come down until it reached his feet which were in the canoe, where Niheu was still waiting. When Niheu looked and saw that the legs were increasing he arose and cut off one, for he was angry with Kana for eating till satisfied. The numbness from this cut went up until it reached the head of Kana, and upon informing his grandmother of this fact, Uli said: “Your younger brother Niheu got angry with you because you partook of food [without remembering him], so he has cut off one of your legs.” After this Uli said to Kana: “You have conquered over your opponent. When you rise up you must extend upward until you tower above the Haupu hill, then make eyes at the hill and when it extends up to meet you, you reach down and break off the flippers on the right side; then break off the flippers on the left side; then it will have no more strength.” After these instructions had been imparted, Kana arose and stood upright until he towered over Haupu, when he made eyes at the hill. At seeing this Haupu extended upward to meet Kana; Kana then reached down and broke off the flippers. As soon as the flippers were broken, the power of Haupu ceased. Kana then stepped down on the hill and it fell to pieces, and as the pieces fell into the sea, they were left there in the form of small hills, which can be seen to this day, at the mouth of the Waikolu Valley, overgrown with loulou palms. By the death of Haupu, the chief Kapepeekauila was conquered and Hina was recovered; and she was brought back to live with her first husband Hakalanileo. This ended the war between Kana and the Haupu hill. [ ]"
"O Alala ka makuakane, o Koukou ka makuahine, o Iole, o Opeapea na kaikuahine o Pikoiakaalala, he mau mua laua ma ka hanau ana no Pikoiakaalala. Olelo hoakaka.

The parents as well as the children were rats who sometimes changed into human beings, as this story will clearly show. Wailua in Kauai was the birthplace of Pikoiakaalala. The first child of Koukou was Iole, a daughter; then followed Opeapea, another daughter. These two were brought up by their parents until they were of age, when they moved to Oahu and married husbands who were connected to certain high chiefs and who were large land owners, during the reign of Kaulamawaho and Kekakapuomaluihi. As Iole and Opeapea had left Kauai for Oahu before the birth of Pikoiakaalala, therefore, they were not present at the birth of their young brother. After they had left, Koukou, their mother, conceived and gave birth to Pikoiakaalala, a son, to whom great care was exercised in his bringing up. In the course of time the child grew to be fine looking but with hair that resembled rat’s hair."
"I loko o ia wa he mea mau i na kanaka a me na keiki ka akoakoa ma kahi hookahi o Wailua e lealea, e makaikai no na mea e hana ia ana. Ia lakou e uwa ana me ka hookanikani pihe no ka olioli, komo aku la keia leo ma na pepeiao o Pikoiakaalala, alaila, ninau oia i ko lakou makuakaue ia Alala: “E, Alala, heaha keia leo e uwa nei o kai o Wailua nei?” “He olohu,” wahi a Alala. “Pehea ia mea?” wahi a Pikoiakaalala. “Penei: olohu iho la na mea elua a oi ka olohu a kekahi, uwa aela, kani ka pihe, oia kela leo au e lohe la.” I aku o Pikoiakaalala: “E iho au e nana ia mea?” “Aole oe e iho e nana,” wahi a Alala, a hala keia la.

Ninau hou ia ia Alala, o ka lua ia: “Heaha keia uwa hou o kai?” “He pahee; pahee iho la a holo loa aku la ka pahee a kekahi uwa ae la.” “E iho au,” pela aku o Pikoiakaalala. Hoole mai o Alala: “Aole oe e iho.”","At about this time it was customary for the people to gather at Wailua to join in and to witness the different athletic sports. One day while the different games were going on, the shouts and yells to encourage the different contestants were heard by Pikoiakaalala. He therefore asked his father Alala: “Say, Alala, what is the cause of that shouting down at Wailua?” “They are playing olohu,” answered Alala. “What is that?” asked Pikoiakaalala. “It is played in this way: there are two contestants playing; when one has rolled his stone disk farther than the other’s, the multitude would shout. That is the noise you hear.” Pikoiakaalala then asked: “Let me go and witness the games?” “You cannot go and see them until after today,” said Alala. After this the multitude shouted again. When Pikoiakaalala heard the commotion, he again asked Alala, this being the second time: “What is that renewed shouting down there?” “They are playing at a game called pahee. When the stick thrown by one contestant slides farther than the one thrown by the other the people would yell.” “I must go down,” said Pikoiakaalala. Alala refused, saying: “You cannot go.”"
"Uwa hou ka pihe o kai, o ke kolu ia, ninau hou ia Alala: “Heaha keia leo hou e uwa nei?” Hai mai o Alala: “He koieie i ka haki wai ana, penei ke ano: he wahi papa pokole i hana ia a maikai, lawe a kahi o ka wai-kahe e ili ana mehe ale la o ka [ ] moana ke opu ae a haki aku, ilaila e lana malie ai me ke kauaheahe. A o ka mea e lana ana peia me ka lilo ole i ka wai, oia kela pihe e uwa maila.” “E iho au?” pela aku o Pikoiakaalala ia Alala. “Ae.”","Again there was yelling at the place, this being the third time. Pikoiakaalala again asked: “What is that fresh shouting that is going on?” Alala replied: “They are playing koieie, at a place in the river near the rapids. The game is played in this [ ] way: it is a short piece of smoothed board which is thrown in the river at a place just near the rapids in such a way that it would float steadily in one place without being carried down the rapids. The one whose piece of board floats the steadiest and is not carried down the rapids wins. The shouting which you have just heard is for the winner.” “May I go down?” asked Pikoiakaalala. “You may,” said Alala."
"Hana iho la o Alala i koieie na Pikoiakaalala a hookuu aku la e iho i kai o Wailua, i kahi o na kanaka e piha ana. A hiki o Pikoiakaalala me kana koieie, nana mai la na mea a pau ia ia nei me ka haohao.

Me ke awa o Kou nei kona pae ana a noho iho la ma ka ae one, he olulo ke ano, no ka mea ua pololi i ka make a ka ai a me ka ia.","Alala then proceeded to make a koieie for Pikoiakaalala, and after it was finished, the boy started down for Wailua where the people were gathered at the games. On the arrival of Pikoiakaalala with his koieie the people all looked at him in surprise. Not very long afterwards the people began throwing their koieie boards into the Wailua River; so Pikoiakaalala threw his into the river also. When the people saw how his koieie floated the steadiest, some of the boys got jealous of him and one of them reached down for Pikoiakaalala’s koieie and threw it into the rapids which carried it into the sea. As soon as his koieie was thrown into the rapids, Pikoiakaalala jumped in after it and he too was carried into the sea by the force of the current for two days and two nights when he landed on Oahu at the harbor of Kou (Honolulu), where he sat on the sand like a castaway, weak from want of food."
"E noho ana laua me ka laua mau kane koikoi ai ahupuaa, aia malalo o laua, he kanaka malama waiwai, o Kauakahi ka inoa. Hele aku la o Kauakahi ma kahi a Pikoiakaalala e moe ana, ninau iho la: “Mahea mai oe?” “Ma ke kai mai nei,” pela aku o Pikoiakaalala. “E hoi kaua i ka hale,” pela aku o Kauakahi.","The two [sisters] were at this time living with their husbands who were men of note, being large land owners, and who had under them a man by the name of Kauakahi as their chief steward. When Kauakahi saw Pikoiakaalala lying there he came up to him and asked: “Where are you from?” “From the sea,” answered Pikoiakaalala. “Come to the house with me,” said Kauakahi."
"A hiki laua i ka hale, olelo aku la o Kauakahi ia Iole a me Opeapea, na kaikuahine o Pikoiakaalala: “He keiki ka’u eia la, loaa aku nei ia’u e moe ana ma ka ae one; nolaila lawe mai nei au i ka hale nei e noho ai me a’u.” Ninau aku la o Iole me Opeapea ia Pikoiakaalala: “Mahea mai oe?

Lele aku la laua uwe, a hai aku la i ka pili ana ia Pikoiakaalala.","Upon their arrival at the house, Kauakahi spoke to Iole and Opeapea, the sisters of Pikoiakaalala: “I have a boy, here he is. I found him asleep on the sand and brought him to the house to live with me.” Iole and Opeapea then asked Pikoiakaalala: “Where are you from? Where were you born and who are your parents?” Pikoiakaalala answered: “Wailua in Kauai is my birthplace. Alala is my father and Koukou is my mother.” When Iole and Opeapea heard these answers given by Pikoiakaalala they knew that he must be their brother, as the names of their parents were correctly given; they therefore sprang on him crying, and at the same time informed Pikoiakaalala of their relationship."
"O ka laua mau kane aia i ka mahiai me na kanaka, hoouna aku la laua ia Kauakahi e kii, me ka olelo aku ua hiki mai ko laua kaikoeke. A hiki o Kauakahi, olelo aku la: “I kauoha mai nei na ’lii wahine ia olua e hoi olua i ka hale, ua puka mai ko olua kaikoeke mai Kauai mai, e kalua puaa a me ka ai.” Ia wa, makaukau na mea a pau a hiki i ka hale, kalua ka puaa me ka ai. Kaha hele aku la o Pikoiakaalala, a puka aku la i kahi o na ’lii o Oahu nei e noho ana, a hiki ia, e pili ana na ’lii i ka pana iole.","The husbands of the sisters of Pikoiakaalala were out in the fields working with the men, so Kauakahi was sent to bring them home and to tell them that their brother-in-law had arrived. When Kauakahi came up to them he said: “You have been sent for by your two wives to return home because your brother-in-law has arrived from Kauai, and to kill a pig and prepare some food.” The food and pig were gotten ready and as soon as they arrived at home they were cooked in the ground."
"Na ’lii. O Kaulamawaho ke kane, o Kekakapuomaluihi ka wahine, e pili ana laua i na waiwai. O Mainele ka ke kane pana iole, a o ka wahine alii aole ana pana [ ] iole; nolaila, olelo hooioi o Pikoiakaalala imua o Mainele, penei: “He mea liilii wale no ia mea, aole ia he mea nalowale.” Lohe ke ’lii wahine i keia olelo a Pikoiakaalala, kahea mai e hele aku a kokoke, a hiki ia, ninau mai ke ’lii wahine: “He ike no oe?” “Ae,” pela aku o Pikoiakaalala.

When he arrived he found them betting on rat shooting. Kaulamawaho the king and Kekakapuomaluihi [ ] the queen were betting their possessions. Mainele was the king’s rat shooter, but the queen had no one to do the shooting for her; so when Pikoiakaalala saw this he boasted in the presence of Mainele in the following manner: “That is simple enough, anybody can do that.” When the queen heard this she called for Pikoiakaalala to come near to her. As he stood in the presence of the queen she asked him: “Do you know how?” Pikoiakaalala answered: “Yes.” “If you know how to shoot rats,” said the queen, “then I will stake my property on your skill and you can compete with Mainele.” As soon as they agreed on the conditions the bet was made."
"No Mainele. He kanaka kaukau alii o Mainele, a he kanaka akamai loa ma ka pana iole, nana wale no ke eo ke pili, he umi iole e ku i ka pua hookahi, i ka pana hookahi ana. No ka pili ana.

Ma keia wahi e ike ia ai, he ano kino iole na makua a me na kaikuahine.","Mainele was a high chief and was an expert in the art of rat shooting; he was known to win all the contests in which he took part. He could hit ten rats with one arrow at one shot. In regard to the wager: the king staked his property on Mainele, while the queen staked her property on Pikoiakaalala. The condition was that whoever could shoot and hit ten rats with one arrow would win, the one failing to do this would lose. Mainele took the first shot, and when the people looked they saw that the arrow had entered into ten rats, so they shouted, “Mainele has won! Mainele has won!” Pikoiakaalala then sarcastically remarked to Mainele: “How awkward! It is easy enough to hit the rat in the body because the object is large. I thought you were going to shoot at the whiskers in order to prove your great skill, but I see I am mistaken.” Mainele answered: “You are a deceitful boy. From the day I first began shooting rats until this day, I have never seen a man who could shoot at the rats’ whiskers.” Because the two were arguing over the matter so long, bets were again made about hitting the rats’ whiskers. After the new bets were made, Pikoiakaalala took his shot. At this time there were no rats to be seen, the brush in the near neighborhood was without rats; so Pikoiakaalala prayed his Kalokalo prayer. By this we can see that his parents and sisters must have had the forms of rats."

Mainele, Pikoiakaalala’s opponent, then said, together with the people who were present: “It is a draw! It is a draw, because you have hit ten rats and one bat with your [ ] arrow, and Mainele has hit ten rats with his arrow. The bat should not be counted as it is not a rat.” Pikoiakaalala replied: “That bat should be counted as a rat, as I have hit it with my arrow, and according to the old saying, which is as follows:"

So Mainele and the king, Kaulamawaho, were beaten. Therefore we can see plainly that the sisters of Pikoiakaalala, Iole and Opeapea, were rats."

This call for a universal gathering was made in order to find Pikoiakaalala. When the people were gathered Pikoiakaalala was not recognized as he stood among them as he had grown larger after partaking of that one meal; for at the time he had his contest with Mainele he was but a mere boy. He was, however, later on recognized by means of his great skill at shooting rats."
Iloko o ke anaina kanaka e noho ana he luahine haumakaiole ua hele a liilii na maka a like me ko ka iole. Kahea o Pikoiakaalala: “Ka iole nui e! Ka iole nui e! Makau ole i ke kanaka keia iole.

When Pikoiakaalala saw her, he shouted out: “See that big rat! What a large rat!! It is not afraid of the people. My arrow will hit you! My arrow will hit you!”"
"I keia kahea ana a Pikoiakaalala, lohe o Mainele a me na ’lii; i aku o Mainele: “Kanaka hoopunipuni oe; aia i hea ia iole holo mai i loko o keia anaina kanaka nui?

A rat!” continued Pikoiakaalala. Mainele replied: “Let us make a wager.” In this new wager the king and queen again took part; the king backed up Mainele while the queen supported Pikoiakaalala. As soon as the wager was decided on, Pikoiakaalala made ready to shoot. Before his arrow left the bow, however, Mainele remarked: “If the actual rat is hit then the wager is won and Pikoiakaalala can [ ] have the stakes.” He said this because they all felt sure that no rat would be seen in the crowd of people."
"Pana o Pikoiakaalala i ka pua, ku ka luahine haumakaiole. Hoole o Mainele a me na kanaka a pau aohe ia he iole, he kanaka ia.

Aole ia he iole? He iole ia.” Eo o Mainele.","When Pikoiakaalala let fly his arrow, it hit the old woman whose eyes were dim and had grown small because of her great age. At seeing this Mainele and the people refused to give up the stakes as the old woman was not a rat, but a human being. Pikoiakaalala answered that the object hit by his arrow was a rat, saying: “When a baby is born it is called a child; when it grows bigger it is called a youth; when it stops growing it is called a full-grown man; when he walks with a cane he is called an old man; and when his eyes grow small he is likened to a rat ‘ haumaka-iole ,’ a rat. Is not that a rat? It is a rat.” Mainele was therefore beaten."

Look at that big rat sitting there!!” At this Mainele remarked: “You are a deceiving man. Where is the rat to come from that you could see there? You are the greatest liar I have ever seen. You have no equal.” Pikoiakaalala said: “There is a rat. If I should shoot and hit a rat, what would you do?” “All right, we will make a bet, if you shoot and hit a rat I lose and if you don’t hit one you lose,” said Mainele. The bets were then made, the king and queen doing the betting, consisting of articles of value and land. After the bets were made, Pikoiakaalala let fly his arrow which flew and hit the top-most batten Kuaiole. At this Mainele looked on and said: “That is not a rat, that is a batten, you have not beaten me.” Pikoiakaalala replied: “That is a rat, for the common expression is this: ‘Put on and bind down the rat-backed batten.’ Is not that expression connection with the word rat? I say it is; therefore, I have won.” At this everybody present decided that Mainele was beaten. When Mainele was beaten this time, his skill and fame began to wane, while the skill and fame of Pikoiakaalala as a shooter of rats was established."
"Maanei, e nana kakou no ke ’lii nui o Hawaii no Keawenuiaumi.

While Keawenuiaumi was on his way with his canoe makers to the forest of Hilo one day, for the purpose of cutting down a large koa tree for a canoe, two birds flew on to the very top of the tree and called out in a loud voice: “Say, Keawenuiaumi, you cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe; a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”"
"A lohe o Keawenuiaumi i keia leo o na manu, haalele i ke oki ana i ke koa, no ke kahea mau o na manu pea i na la a pau loa; nolaila, uluhua o Keawenuiaumi, a manao iho la oia e imi i kanaka akamai i ka pana pua i make na manu.

As the birds kept up this calling continually Keawenuiaumi became vexed and thereupon made up his mind to go in search of a skillful archer to come and kill the birds. About this time the fame of Mainele as an archer reached Hawaii, so Keawenuiaumi made a vow, “That if Mainele would kill the birds he should receive the king’s daughter in marriage together with a portion of the island of Hawaii.” Upon the arrival of Keawenuiaumi’s messengers in Oahu, Mainele was informed of the wish of the king. As soon as Mainele heard that he was wanted on Hawaii, he immediately prepared his double canoe and got together his men who were to accompany him. [ ]"
"O Kauakahi, ke kanaka nana i lawe o Pikoiakaalala, ia ia e moe ana ma ka ae one mahope o kona pae ana mai Kauai mai, olelo aku la ia ia Pikoiakaalala: “E holo ana o Mainele i Hawaii e pana ai i na manu, ua hiki mai nei na elele a Keawenuiaumi.” “Ae, ina oe e manao e holo au, e pii oe i ie, a ulana hokeo, i wahi no’u e noho ai, i ole au e ike ia e Mainele, a e olelo no hoi oe, he hokeo akua nou. Pela au e hiki ai.” Hana iho la o Kauakahi e like me na olelo a Pikoiakaalala, a makaukau ka hinai ie, a me ka holo o Mainele.","When Kauakahi, the man who found Pikoiakaalala sleeping on the sand, heard of the contemplated trip to be made by Mainele to Hawaii, he went to Pikoiakaalala and told him of what he had heard, saying: “Mainele is going to Hawaii to shoot birds for Keawenuiaumi; the messengers have just arrived from Hawaii.” Pikoiakaalala answered: “If you wish me to go along you had better go up and get some ie vines and make a basket in the shape of a calabash for me to hide in, so that I may not be seen by Mainele, and you can say that it is a basket for the safe keeping of your god. This will be the means of getting me to Hawaii.” Kauakahi then followed out the instructions given by Pikoiakaalala and had the basket made, and the trip with Mainele arranged."
"I aku o Mainele ia Kauakahi: “E holo kaua i Hawaii.” Ae mai o Kauakahi: “Ae, he ae no ko’u i ka holo me oe i Hawaii, aia nae a ae oe i ka’u olelo.” “Heaha ia ia olelo?” wahi a Mainele. “He hokeo akua no’u, he kapu kona waa e kau ai, aohe kanaka e kau ma kona waa, owau wale no.” Ua pono ia olelo ia Mainele. I ka la o lakou i holo ai i Hawaii, kau aku la o Mainele ma kona mau kaulua, me na ohua a me na hoewaa; o Kauakahi me Pikoiakaalala i loko o ka hokeo ie ma ko laua waa, mahope ka hokeo, mamua o Kauakahi.","When Mainele’s preparations were finally completed, he approached Kauakahi and said: “Let us sail to Hawaii.” Kauakahi replied: “All right, I am willing to go to Hawaii with you providing you give me your consent to do what I want.” “What is it you want?” asked Mainele. “I have a basket where my god is kept. The canoe in which this god is to be taken, as I want to take it along, must be tabued and no one must be allowed to take passage in it outside of myself.” This was satisfactory to Mainele. On the day agreed on for the voyage to start for Hawaii, Mainele, his followers and paddlers boarded their double canoe, while Kuakahi and Pikoiakaalala, who was in the basket, boarded their canoe, the basket in the after part and Kuakahi in the fore part of the canoe."
"Olelo hoakaka no ka hokeo ie. No ka hakahaka o ka ulana ana, komo ka makani i loko, aole e pau ke aho, nolaila i komo ai o Pikoiakaalala i loko e noho ai. A hala o Oahu nei mahope o lakou, hoalulu na waa o lakou mawaho o ka pali o Kaholo, i Lanai, a ahiahi, hina ke kehau o Kahalapalaoa mahope o na waa, holo aku la lakou mai ia ahiahi a owakawaka kai ao o ke kakahiaka nui, nana aku la lakou i ka wailele o Kawaikapu i na pali hulaana, e kupono ana i Makaukiu ma Kohala i Hawaii. Aia hoi, he hulaana, o Kuukuunaakaiole ka inoa e hamama mai ana kona waha i kahi a na waa e holo aku nei. I aku o Pikoiakaalala ia Kauakahi: “E olelo aku oe ia Mainele e pana aku i ka waha o ka iole e pouliuli mai nei.” A lohe o Mainele i ka olelo a Kauakahi, hoole maila: “Aohe iole, he pali ia; he kanaka lalau oe.”","A few words of explanation relating to the basket. This was made with several openings which allowed a free current of air and enabled Pikoiakaalala to sit therein. After leaving Oahu to their rear, the canoes after a quick passage, were laid to off the cliffs of Kaholo, at Lanai, on the afternoon of that same day. In the evening the breeze from Kahalepalaoa which came directly from behind them sent their canoes flying along at such a rate of speed that by dawn of the next morning they were able to make out the waterfall of Kawaikapu on the steep cliffs of Makaukiu, Kohala, Hawaii. At this place is a sort of a bay surrounded by high cliffs which opens directly to the sea and which was right ahead of the canoes as they were approaching land; the name of the place is Kuukuunaakaiole. Pikoiakaalala upon seeing where they were said to Kauakahi: “Tell Mainele to shoot at the mouth of the rat which is dimly seen ahead of us.” When Mainele heard this he replied to Kauakahi: “That is not a rat, that is a cliff, you are mistaken.”"
"A haalele lakou i na pali hulaana, po a ao hiki lakou ma Hilo a pae ma ke awa o Kaipalao; pii na mea a pau a hiki i kahi o Keawenuiaumi, koe o Kauakahi me ka hokeo ie ana. I aku o Mainele: “E pii kaua.” Olelo mai o Kauakahi: “Aole au e pii a hiki kuu hokeo akua. Ia lohe ana o Mainele, kauoha aku la o Mainele ia Keawenuiaumi i kanaka no ka hokeo akua e hiki ai i uka. Kena mai la o Keawenuiaumi eha kanaka, amo aku la i ka hokeo ie a hiki i ka hale, olelo aku o Kauakahi ia Mainele: “Aole kakou e pono ke noho ma ka hale hookahi me ke ’kua o kaua, e aho e olelo oe ia Keawenuiaumi i wahi hale no maua.” Olelo aku la o Mainele ia Keawenuiaumi, i [ ] hale no ke akua o laua me Kauakahi; mahope oia lohe ana, aohe i upuupu iho paa ka hale, haawale o Kauakahi me ka hokeo ie. O keia mau hana a pau loa, na Pikoiakaalala wale no, i ole oia e ike ia e Mainele a me na kanaka.","Upon passing the cliffs they continued on their way to Hilo, at which place they arrived the next day and landed at Kaipalaoa. Everybody upon landing proceeded to the place where Keawenuiaumi was at that time residing with the exception of Kauakahi and his basket. When Mainele saw that Kauakahi was left behind he asked him: “Let us go on up?” Kauakahi replied: “I will not go on up unless the basket which my god is in goes with me.” When Mainele heard this, he requested of Keawenuiaumi that men be furnished to carry the basket along up to the house, whereupon Keawenuiaumi ordered four men to pack the basket to the house. Upon their arrival at the house, Kauakahi spoke to Mainele: “I don’t think it right for us to live in the same house with our god; it is best that you ask Keawenuiaumi that a small house be given me where I can live with the god.” Mainele therefore requested of Keawenuiaumi for [ ] a house for the god and Kauakahi. As soon as the king heard this, orders were given that a small house be built, which was finished in no time, where Kauakahi moved in with his basket. This request was really made at the wish of Pikoiakaalala, in order that he might not be seen by Mainele and the people."
"Lohe na mea a pau loa, pana o Mainele i ka pua, aohe launa ae i na manu. Hana ke olokea he alanui e pii ae ai a waena o ke koa pana ae, aohe no he launa ae i na manu. Hawanawana aku o Pikoiakaalala ia Kauakahi: “E ninau alu oe ia Mainele a me Keawenuiaumi heaha keia ku ole o na manu? He pana ole ia paha i ka pua, ina paha e pana ia ku na manu.” A lohe o Mainele i keia olelo a Kauakahi, i mai la: “Aole no la hoi e pana ae; aia no hoi ka manu ke kau mai la, eia ka pua, pana ae no hoi paha, malama o ku ia oe.” I aku o Kauakahi: “Ae, e olelo ae au i kuu akua a nana e pana na manu.” Ia wa ku ana o Pikoiakaalala mai loko ae o ka hokeo ie me kana pua pana iole. Alaila, ike o Mainele a me na kanaka o Oahu aku nei he kanaka ko loko o ka hokeo ie.

Ia pana ana, ku na manu a elua, pahu ana i lalo, uwa ka aha kanaka i ke akamai o Pikoiakaalala.","As soon as the people heard the call, Mainele shot at the birds, but his arrow did not come anywhere near them on account of the height of the tree. A staging was then built up which reached about half way up the tree, but even then Mainele’s arrow did not reach the birds. Pikoiakaalala then whispered to Kauakahi: “Ask Mainele and Keawenuiaumi why the birds are not hit. Perhaps Mainele was not shooting at them, if he did he would hit them.” When Mainele heard the remarks of Kauakahi, he replied: “Why don’t you shoot at them yourself? There are the birds, here is the bow and here are the arrows, go ahead and shoot, may be you will hit them.” At this Kauakahi replied: “All right, I will ask my god to shoot the birds.” Pikoiakaalala then came out of the basket with his rat shooting arrows to the surprise of Mainele and the Oahu people that accompanied him, for they had not known that a man had been in this basket all this time. Upon coming up to Keawenuiaumi, Pikoiakaalala requested that a basin of water be brought and made to stand under the tree. As soon as this was done Pikoiakaalala came and stood over the basin; while he looked into the basin at the reflection of the birds in the water, he held his arms above his head with his bow bent and his arrow aimed at the birds; as soon as he saw that the birds were in line he let fly his arrow which flew true to the mark hitting both birds and they came tumbling down to the ground. The people upon seeing this great skill shown by Pikoiakaalala gave a mighty shout."
"Lilo ke kaikamahine a Keawenuiaumi ia Pikoiakaalala a me kekahi aoao o Hawaii waiwai o Kauakahi, hilahila o Mainele a hoi mai i Oahu nei. [ ]","Keawenuiaumi, true to his word gave his daughter to Pikoiakaalala to wife and also gave him a portion of Hawaii, which made Kauakahi a very rich man. Mainele was so ashamed that he immediately returned to Oahu. [ ]"
"Oka aina i noho ai o Kalelealuaka a me Keinohoomanawanui, o Lihue e waiho ana malalo hikina o ka mauna o Kaala i Oahu. O ke kahua hale nae, o Oahunui.

The ground upon which the house stood is “Oahunui”. At this time Kakuhihewa was the king of Ewa and of the districts adjoining; while Pueonui was the king of the district of Kona, embracing that stretch of country from Moanalua to Makapuu. At this time these two kings were contending in war with each other whereby Pueonui was acquiring the Ewa lands. Kalelealuaka was a very brave and fearless man in battle and in fighting. Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui often spent their time wishing for certain things. The house in which they lived faced directly towards Ewa."
"He kanaka koa loa o Kalelealuaka ma ke kaua a me ka hakaka. O ka laua hana me Keinohoomanawanui, o ke kuko. O ko laua hale, ua kupono ka puka i kai o Ewa, o ko laua manawa e kuko ai, o ka wa pau o ka paina ana o ke ahiahi e pupuhi ana kukui, aia a hoi e moe, kau ke poo i ka uluna, huli ke alo iluna nana i kaupoku o ka hale.

That is my wish, I want you to know.”"
"I aku o Kalelealuaka: “Aole kau he kuko; o ka’u no ke kuko.” “Pehea kau kuko?” wahi a Keinohoomanawanui. “O na ilio nahu maka o Kakuhihewa na kaua e ai; ka puaa kea o ka niho, na kaua e kalua; ke awa nui o na loko na kaua e ai, na puawa ona na kaua e inu.

Helelei, he keu mawaho o ka umi; oia ke ano ma ka olelo kahiko o Hawaii nei. Eia ke ano o keia mau inoa.","Kalelealuaka would then reply: “That is no wish, I have the proper wish.” “What is your wish?” Keinohoomanawanui would ask. “That we may eat the dogs of Kakuhihewa that bite the face of people; that we may bake the hog whose tusks are crossed; that we may eat the fat awa of the fish ponds; that we may drink of the best and most intoxicating awa; that Kakuhihewa himself shall chew the awa, strain it into the containers, pour it out into the cups, place the cups to our lips; and after we have slept off the effects of the awa, that he bring his daughters and make them our wives. That is my wish, I want you to know.” Keinohoomanawanui then replied: “Say, we will get killed. I thought we were to wish on other subjects; but I see your wish is in relation to the king. If that is your wish we will surely get killed.” This was carried on by these two for ten nights and over."
"No keia a mau o ke kukui i na po a pau, uluhua o Kakuhihewa, kena i ke kiu e pii e nana i keia kukui a o ke aumoe.

As the [ ] spy arrived and stood on the outside of the house he heard Keinohoomanawanui name his wish, which was followed by Kalelealuaka, after this the two became quiet. The spy then stuck a short wooden dagger in the ground at the entrance of the house and returned to the king. At his arrival the king asked: “What was that lamp burning for that you went up to see?” The spy then repeated all he had heard. While the spy was repeating what he had heard to the king, a priest was at this time with the king. At the conclusion of the recital, the king turned to the priest and asked him: “What about that man Kalelealuaka? Do you think his wish proper or not?” The priest replied: “What he has said should be carried out, because he will be the man to gain the conquest for you, so that you will own the whole island. You must, however, carry out every detail of his wish with your own hands.” On the advice of the priest, Kakuhihewa proceeded to carry out in detail the wish made by Kalelealuaka. The priest had, however, instructed the king to build two houses, one to serve as an eating house and the other a sleeping house; both to be built and completed in one day and then Kalelealuaka was to be sent for and brought down."
"Ia laua e kamailio ana no ka pahoa i kukulu ia ma ka puka o ka hale, nana aku la laua i ka moe mai o ke kaoo huakai kanaka, mai kahi o ke ’lii a kokoke i ko laua nei wahi, me na koi lipi mai mua a hope o ka huakai. “Aia hoi paha ka make o kaua la,” pela aku o Keinohoomanawanui ia Kalelealuaka; makau wale. O keia huakai, he poe ooki laau hale, e like me na olelo a ke kahuna i ke ’lii, hookahi la ua paa na hale elua.","While they were discussing the dagger found at their door, they looked down toward Ewa and saw a company of people coming up toward them from the king’s house all armed with stone axes from front to rear of the procession. At the sight of the people Keinohoomanawanui remarked: “There perhaps is our death coming?” Kalelealuaka replied: “You coward.” The company they saw coming was on their way to cut timber for the erection of the two houses as advised by the priest. These houses were completed in one day."
"NO KE KII ANA IA KALELEALUAKA A ME KEINOHOOMANAWANUI, E LAWE I KAI O EWA IMUA O KE ’LII O KAKUHIHEWA.",HOW KALELEALUAKA AND KEINOHOOMANAWANUI WERE SENT FOR AND HOW THEY WERE TAKEN TO KING KAKUHIHEWA AT EWA.
"Ia po a ao ae, nana hou aku la o Keinohoomanawanui i nei huakai nui e pii mai ana mai kai mai o Ewa, me na pololu, me ka ihe me ke kuia, me ka elau, me na mahiole, me ka ahuula, me ka manele auamo.

Eia hoi ka manele la kau mai iluna.”","On the following day Keinohoomanawanui again saw a large company of people coming up from Ewa, all armed with spears and other instruments of war; some had war helmets and feather capes while some had a litter for carrying people. Upon seeing the people Keinohoomanawanui turned to Kalelealuaka and said: “Our death is now close upon us.” Kalelealuaka replied: “Keep your eye on them.” Kalelealuaka all this time was lying down with his war club, showing no fear and acting as though willing to fight. When the people arrived outside of the house, six of them surrounded the house all armed with death weapons. Soon after this Kalelealuaka got up, stepped [ ] outside with his war club in hand, raised it and struck it on the house cutting it in two and scattering the grass and timbers in all directions. The officer in command of the soldiers spoke up saying: “We did not come here to inflict death, but we have been sent to bring you to Ewa by the orders of Kakuhihewa, the king. Here is the litter, get in.”"
"A hiki lakou nei i kai o Ewa, ua hoomakaukau ponoi o Kakuhihewa ke ’lii i na mea a pau, e like me ka olelo a ke kahuna i olelo mua ia ma ka hoomaka ana o keia kaao.

Lilo ae la o Kalelealuaka i hunona na ke ’lii a me Keinohoomanawanui, hookahi hana a Kalelealuaka he hiamoe i loko o ka hale me ka wahine, ke kaikamahine a Kakuhihewa.","Before their arrival at Ewa, Kakuhihewa had in the meantime prepared with his own hands everything as advised by the priest, as already set forth in this story. The reason why Kakuhihewa had followed the instructions was because he wanted to gain possession of all of Pueonui’s lands, and also because the priest had advised him so. Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui were from this time on taken as the king’s sons-in-law. All Kalelealuaka did after this was to retire with the daughter of Kakuhihewa in one of the houses prepared for them."
"I loko o keia wa a lakou e noho nei, hoomaka ke kaua o na ’lii, o Kakuhihewa a me Pueonui. O Keinohoomanawanui lilo ae la ia i luna koa, oia kekahi i hele i ke kaua, ua lanakila ko lakou aoao ma ke kaua ana me Pueonui.

Keinohoomanawanui was at once made one of the king’s officers and he went out to take part in one of the battles, and in which Pueonui was beaten. Kakuhihewa and his men went out to fight during the daytime and they slew a great many of Pueonui’s men. Keinohoomanawanui always gained the victory in these battles so that in time the king began to give Keinohoomanawanui the credit of such splendid results."
"No Kalelealuaka. I ke ao, moe oia a kani ka moa kuakahi o ka wanaao, hele e pepehi i na ’lii koa o Pueonui.

He would run from Ewa to Kapukaki, the heights looking down at Halawa, where he would meet the officers of the opposing army and fight them single handed, striking on the right and then on the left. After slaying the enemy by the use of his war club he would carry off their war helmets and feather capes. This was carried on by him for several nights without the knowledge of anyone. One night as he was returning a farmer at Halawa saw him. Kalelealuaka had slain several of Pueonui’s men, and secured some feather capes and war helmets and was on his way home; but he was traveling at such speed that the farmer was unable to make out who he was. On the night following the farmer thought he would lie in wait for this man; sure enough he saw Kalelealuaka going along at a very great rate of speed, so taking up his spear whose point was fixed like a hook, he threw it and hit the man in the arm just above the wrist; the spear point entered and was made fast. Kalelealuaka seizing the spear tried to pull it out, but was unable on account of the peculiar point, so he broke it, leaving the point still in the arm."
"O Pueonui ua pio kona aoao, a ua pau loa kona aina ia Kakuhihewa, ua manao hoi o Kakuhihewa na Keinohoomanawanui keia pio o Pueonui, a me keia make o na kanaka. No ke kanaka mahiai.

Kakuhihewa all this time thought Keinohoomanawanui was the cause of these victories over Pueonui and the slaughter of the men. In the meantime the farmer refused to give Keinohoomanawanui the credit of these victories and declared that the final defeat and death of Pueonui was the work of a different man altogether, who went out to fight only in the early morning. He described this unknown man as a very fast runner of whom he knew no equal; the man always carried a war club, and on his return would come with war helmets and feather capes. “I have wounded him in the arm and I think [ ] the spear point is still in his arm. It will be the means by which the man could be recognized.”"
"A lohe o Kakuhihewa i keia mau olelo kukala aku la ia i kana olelo kuahaua: “Aohe kanaka noho, aohe wahine, aohe keiki.

[ ]","When Kakuhihewa heard this, he issued a call for everybody to come together, no man, woman or child to remain at home, excepting those who when they fell down were unable to get up again, and those who were so sick that they could not walk. After everybody had come together, the farmer proceeded to look for his man by looking at their arms; but he was unable to locate him. He then asked Kakuhihewa: “Is there no one left?” “None,” said the king, “except my son-in-law who is asleep at home, and has done nothing requiring him.” “Send for him and let me see [his arm],” said the farmer. When Kalelealuaka came up to the farmer and held up his arm the point of the spear was found. The farmer then remarked: “Surely, this is the man that slew all of Pueonui’s men, and this is the very man whom I saw coming in the early morning while I was on my way to work and at whom I threw the spear, the point of which is still in his arm. I also saw him returning with war helmets and feather capes, and I am certain his house must be filled with those articles; let someone be sent to fetch them.” When the man that was sent returned, he brought with him several war helmets and feather capes which made a huge pile, proving that it was Kalelealuaka that caused the overthrow and final defeat of Pueonui. So Kalelealuaka was made chief ruler, while Kakuhihewa served under him. [ ]"
"O Pukoula e pili la me ka waiahao kahi noho o Pumaia, ma Kona, Oahu. O kana hana he hanai puaa ma kana wahine. Aia ia laua he umi pa puaa, a hookahi puaa punahele loa ia Pumaia, he puaa anana, he puaa lilo ole ia hai, he puaa hanai a make pu me Pumaia.","On the land of Pukoula which adjoins Waiahao in the district of Kona, Oahu, was the home of Pumaia. His chief occupation with that of his wife, was hog raising. They at one time had as many as ten hog pens; but amongst his whole herd [of hogs] there was one he thought a good deal more of than all the others; one that measured over a fathom in length which he had vowed he would never part from. This hog was to be kept until the death of Pumaia when it was to be killed."

A makaukau lakou e hele mai e kau me Pumaia.","Kualii who was king at this time, was building the temple called Kapua, which was situated to the east of Leahi Hill overlooking Mamala. At the completion of the temple, Kualii ordered that a hog be brought from Pumaia. Upon the arrival of the messengers, Pumaia asked them: “What is the object of your call?” “We have been sent by Kualii to you for a hog for the temple. You give us one.” “Yes, you can have one,” said Pumaia. “There is the pig pen.” This request was kept up until all the ten hog pens were exhausted and there remained but the one hog he thought so much of. After a time Kualii sent his men for another hog. Upon their arrival in the presence of Pumaia, they were asked: “What has brought you here?” “We have been sent by Kualii to come for the hog that is left.” “You shall not have it. He is only seeking trouble. I thought he was really in need of swine, but no.” The men then grabbed the hog and fought with Pumaia for its possession, many against one. In this fight [ ] sometimes Pumaia would get possession of the pig and again the others would get it. This was kept up for some time when at last a regular fight was had. Pumaia then struck out one blow on the right and one on the left with his fists, killing all the men except one, who ran to the king, Kualii, and reported to him, saying: “We have all been killed by Pumaia and I alone am left to bring the tidings to you.” Kualii then ordered his soldiers and officers to arm themselves with their spears and other implements of war and to dress in their war helmets and feather capes and when ready to go and make war on Pumaia."
"Haalele iho la keia ia Pukoula, nee aku la ia a Kewalo, o kahi ia i hoouka ai me Pumaia, malaila i luku ia ai na koa, a me na ’lii o Kualii a pau loa i ka make ia Pumaia.

Ma keia hoomainoino ana ia Pumaia, ua wali ka iwi auwae, a ua weluwelu no hoi.","After this fight Pumaia left Pukoula and moved on to Kewalo where he was met by the soldiers and a regular battle was fought in which Pumaia slew all of Kualii’s warriors and officers. One of the men, however, managed to escape and carried the result to Kualii. When Kualii heard that his warriors and officers had all been killed, he called all his chiefs and warriors to come together, with his god, Kanemuka. Pumaia in the meantime had moved on to Pawaa, where he was met by Kualii and his men, and another battle was fought in which Pumaia again slew all the chiefs and warriors, with the exception of Kualii and his god. When Kualii saw that his men and chiefs were all slain he prayed to his god to capture Pumaia, and so through the power of this god Pumaia was caught and bound. Kualii was so incensed at Pumaia that he was immediately killed and was dragged to Kapua where his dead body was thrown into the pit with the men he had killed. In the course of the ill treatment given his body, the jaws were crushed and cut up into fragments."
"No ka wahine a Pumaia. Noho iho la ia me ka laua kaikamahine opiopio i ka hale, e kali ana i ka hoi mai o ke kane, mai ka aui ana o ka la a ke aumoe kupono i ke kau.

At this long absence of Pumaia the mother remarked to the daughter: “Your father perhaps is dead. In all his travels before this he generally returned home before dark.” While the two were talking they heard a shaking noise outside the house and an indistinct call to open the door. The mother then rose and opened the door, and lo it was the spirit of Pumaia. Relating to the spirit of Pumaia: It is told in this legend that the spirit is always much stronger than the living body and that several people have been killed by spirits; the following narrative will show this."

Akahi no au a lohe ua make.” A lohe na elele, maopopo aole i kii ka wahine, hoi aku la lakou.","As the jaw bones of Pumaia were so crushed his words were indistinctly heard, so the spirit had to resort to whispers and gesticulations of the hands, like a deaf and dumb person, in order to be understood. Pumaia then said to his wife: “I struck out right and left and killed them all.” The wife asked: “You killed them all?” “Yes, yes,” at the same time bringing the hands together and making the negative motion to indicate that nothing was left. Pumaia then said to the wife: “Let us go and get my body.” The wife assented and took a piece of kapa cloth in which to wrap the body. The blazing spirit then went ahead, the wife following until they reached Kapua, the temple of Kualii and the pit where the body had been thrown. The spirit of Pumaia then flew and landed right in the center of the pit and flamed; the night guards were fast asleep, as it was then well on towards midnight, the Milky Way being plainly seen. The wife then approached the hole and felt of the dead bodies. The [ ] spirit then whispered and at the same time making motions with the hands to remove the dead bodies and pointed down in the bottom of the hole. The wife followed the instructions until she found the body of Pumaia beneath, all ragged and torn. She then collected the pieces and put them in the kapa cloth, in the form of a bundle, put it on her back and returned home. Upon her arrival at the house Pumaia’s spirit told the wife, at the same time pointing at the floor of the house, to remove the mats, dig a hole and conceal the body, before the arrival of the people who would search for the body the next day. The wife did as she was told. On the next day a searching party arrived looking for the body of Pumaia. The searchers asked Pumaia’s wife: “Did you not go and remove the body of your husband last night?” “I do not know anything about it nor have I removed it. Is Pumaia then dead? This is the first that I have heard of his death.” When the searchers heard this they were certain that the wife could not have removed the body, so they returned [to the king]."

The spirit of Pumaia flew to this cave and lit there flaming. The wife with the bones of Pumaia and the daughter then climbed up the cliff until they arrived at the cave, where they made their dwelling. At the end of the fourth day, the last finger of food for the daughter was eaten up when the mother said: “I am distressed at your fate, the one having bones that need blood. Here we are following after the bones that have no blood, and have left food and meat.” When they woke up the next morning they saw food, meat and other articles such as kapas, skirts and various other things. All these things had been brought by the spirit of Pumaia from Waikiki. In that one night the spirit had traveled over the whole district. This was carried on for several nights and the food and animals, the fish in the ponds and the growing food were brought to the cave. The spirit of Pumaia kept up these raids until at last it began to raid Kualii’s own lands. All the different properties were taken, even the canoes, mats, war helmets, feather capes, calabashes, water gourds and various other things of the house and the land. At night, while the people were asleep, Pumaia’s spirit would enter the house, carry out the sleepers and then empty the house of their valuables. Upon waking up in the morning the people would find themselves out of doors and their houses robbed of all the things of value; even the growing crops in the [ ] field were stolen by Pumaia’s spirit. By these raids the wife and daughter were able to have all they wanted and far more than their needs. One day the wife sighed and said: “Yes, we have all we need, but there is one thing lacking, we have no servant to do our work for us.” When Pumaia’s spirit heard this, it went off and brought back a servant for the wife and daughter."
"No Kualii.

A priest who was living with him at the time then told Kualii who the thief was in the following manner: “This thief is no other person than your enemy Pumaia; his body is dead, but his spirit is at large and is much stronger than when the body was alive. You will soon be killed; if you act rightly you will then be saved.” “What must I do to be saved?” asked Kualii. The priest replied: “You must build three houses; one house for the wife and daughter; one house for the property and servants; and one house for the bones of Pumaia. After the houses are completed go and bring your enemy back and take good care of his bones; he may then take compassion on you and you will then be saved.” Kualii then consented to do all the things advised by the priest."
"Ma keia olelo a ke Kahuna ia Kualii, ua akaka wale no ia ia Pumaia. A makaukau o Kualii i na mea a pau loa, ia wa, pane aku o Pumaia i ka wahine a me ke kaikamahine, e hoi i kai.

[ ]","While this conversation was being carried between the priest and Kualii, Pumaia was amused as he heard the advice of the priest and the consent given by Kualii. He then advised his wife and daughter to return to the shore. The wife in obedience to the instructions made ready for their return. While on their way back to the old home they met Kualii’s men who had been sent to bring them to the king. Upon their arrival at the king’s house, they found everything prepared for their reception and they lived with the king ever after this. [ ]"

The duty of this spirit, Hanaaumoe, was to meet all the canoes that arrived from other lands and through his cunning and flattery urge the people to land. In this way several people were killed and eaten by the spirits. As this spirit had no equal in the art of flattery, he was delegated by Halalii the king of the spirits to guard all the points along the coast of Oahu. While he was on duty one day he saw canoes approaching Oahu from the west. In the double canoe was Kahaookamoku the friend of the king of Kauai, several men and Kaneopa a lame fellow. These people were from Kauai and were on their way to Hawaii to make a visit. Hanaaumoe upon seeing these people invited them to come ashore: “Come ashore, land your canoe. Don’t go to Hawaii for that island is filled with spirits. Hawaii has spirits for Kanikaa lives there. Maui has spirits for Keoloewa lives there. Lanai has spirits for Pahulu lives there. Molokai has spirits for Kaunolu lives there. Here is the island that has no spirits; land the canoe. There is food ashore, there are houses, [ ] there are women for each, the paddlers shall have two apiece, as wives, and your chief Kahaookamoku shall have five wives.”"

Late that evening Hanaaumoe came to the door of the house where the strangers were sleeping, scattered here and there like castaways, being very tired from the effects of the sea trip, and called out:"
"Kahea ana o Hanaaumoe, moe ea? Halahala kau e, Halahala kau e, Ua moe oukou?","Asleep are you? Piled on one another, Scattered here and there, Are you all asleep?"

Upon hearing the call, Kaneopa answered: “We are not asleep, we are still awake waiting for the food, and meat and our wives.” Hanaaumoe then resorted to falsehood: “The things cannot arrive in a hurry as the road from Nuuanu down is long, the climb from Kapukaki is long and the plain Kulaokahua is also afar off.” Hanaaumoe soon after this returned to Halalii and to the rest of the spirits who asked him: “How is it, are they asleep?” Hanaaumoe answered: “No, they are not asleep yet?” At midnight Hanaaumoe again returned and called, the second time:"
"I mai o Kaneopa: “Aole makou i moe; ke kali aku nei no i na wahine palua a na hoewaa, palima a ke ’lii a Kahaookamoku.” Pane mai o Hanaaumoe e like me na olelo maluna, a hoi aku la; maopopo iho la iaia aole i pau i ka moe.","Kaneopa answered: “We are not asleep, we are waiting for the two wives apiece for the paddlers and the five wives for the chief Kahaookamoku.” Hanaaumoe again answered as he did before and then departed, being certain that the people were not asleep yet."

After studying the matter for a while he at last decided to dig a hole under the door sill; for he reasoned that the king would, upon entering the house, naturally sit on the door sill. All this time the rest of the people were in a deep sleep, no one was awake except Kaneopa. Kaneopa was sorry for the chief Kahaookamoku because he would surely be eaten up by the spirits and Kaneopa was at a loss to know how he was going to save him. Kaneopa tried to keep himself awake, but could only last until the crowing of the first cock, when he too became so overcome with sleep and moved under the door sill and sat in the hole. Just as soon as he entered the hole, Hanaaumoe arrived and he again called as before, for the third time. There was no answer. He called again, again there was no answer. Hanaaumoe then said: “You will surely be all killed. Why didn’t you sleep at Kauai instead of coming and sleep on the island of Halalii where the spirits live? You are as good as dead, there is no escape; your flesh, your bones, your bowels, your blood, your eyes, will all be eaten up.” During all this talk by Hanaaumoe, Kaneopa was listening. At the end Hanaaumoe [ ] returned to Halalii. Halalii then asked him: “How is it, are they asleep?” “Yes, they are asleep, let us be going,” said Hanaaumoe to the rest of the spirits."
"A hiki lakou i ka hale o Kaneopa ma e moe nei, komo ke akua a pau loa i loko o ka hale, noho iho la o Halalii ke ’lii ma ka paepae o ka puka.

The spirits were so numerous that they were without number. They made but one smack and the people disappeared, all eaten up by the spirits. The spirits then began digging up the floor of the house except that portion under the sill where Halalii was sitting. At the approach of day the spirits all returned to their home and Haneopa came out of his hiding place and limping to the canoe he pushed it into the sea and set sail for Kauai."
"Ia Kaneopa e holo aua i loko o ke kai, ku ana o Hanaaumoe ma ka lae kahakai, peahi ana ia Kaneopa: “E pae! e pae ka waa!” I mai o Kaneopa me ka olelo huhu: “E akua ai lepo o ke kanaka, kai no ua pau ko makou alii ia oukou; aole au e pae aku ana.”","While Kaneopa was on his way to Kauai, Hanaaumoe appeared on the coast and beckoned to Kaneopa, inviting him to land, saying: “Come ashore. Let the canoe come ashore.” Kaneopa then answered angrily: “You are a filthy old spirit. Didn’t you eat up our chief? I will not come ashore.”"
"A hiki o Kaneopa i Kauai, hai aku la i ke ’lii a me na kanaka, i ko lakou pau i ka ai ia e ke akua o Oahu nei, a koe ia ma kona maalea.

The king then asked the priest: “What must we do?” The priest, Hanakapiai, answered: “Proceed and hew out a countless number of wooden images that will look as near as possible to human beings.” After the images were ready, the king, the priest and a large number of followers set sail for Oahu and in course of time hove to directly off Leahi, when they saw Hanaaumoe appear on the coast and called out as he did the other time. Kaneopa, who was in the company on this second visit, said to the people who were with him: “That is Hanaaumoe the great flatterer. That is the spirit who deceived us and got us to land.” The king and priest in answer to the invitation replied: “Yes, we will land.” The people then all came ashore and approached the long house where Kahaookamoku and his companions had stayed and were eaten up by the spirits."

Let everybody be supplied with lights with which to set the house on fire as soon as all the spirits have entered the house.” Late that evening, the flatterer, the spirit Hanaaumoe came to the house and called out:"
"Aohe leo pane o loko, kahea hou, o ka lua ia, aole no he leo pane mai. Olelo iho ua o Hanaaumoe: “A ha ha! Ihea no la ka moe i Kauai, moe aku; lawe ia mai ka ka moe a ka moku akua o Halalii. Make!

Hanaaumoe then spoke to himself: “Ha, ha! Why didn’t you sleep on Kauai instead of coming here and sleep on the spirit island of Halalii? Dead, you will not be saved.” While Hanaaumoe was calling the people were listening. At the end of his call Hanaaumoe returned to Halalii and reported to him that the people were all asleep. Upon hearing this report Halalii issued a call that all the spirits be brought together; after this they proceeded to the long house at the beach. Upon coming up to the house the spirits all entered and Halalii sat on the door sill. The spirits then took up the wooden [ ] images and began eating them. “Oh, how tough!” was heard from one of the spirits. “So is the one I am eating,” said another. It was customary in days gone by for the king to receive the choicest portions of the meat, so these portions were given to Halalii by the spirits. Upon taking a bite at one of these choice portions, Halalii remarked: “Very tough.” The rest of the spirits answered: “All these people are very tough, not one of them is fat, they are all thin and tough. They are not at all like the first lot that came.”"
"Ia lakou e walea ana i ka ai i ke kii, hoopuni ia ae la ka hale a puni e na kanaka me ka momoku ahi, o ka manawa ia i puhi ia ai ka hale i ke ahi, a pau loa ke akua i ke ahi, a lilo aku o Hanaaumoe a pakele aku la.

Eleio was a very fast runner, faster than the wind, and could make three complete circuits of the island of Maui in one day. Because of his great speed, he was made runner to King Kakaalaneo. It was his duty as runner to bring (awa ) fish from Hana for the king. When a meal was about ready, Eleio would set out for Hana to bring fish and he would always return before the king sat down to eat. Once while he was on his way back, he met on the road Kaahualii, a spirit, who asked him for some fish. Eleio answered: “Take the hairs on your behind for the fish and your urine for water.” When Kaahualii heard this, he chased Eleio. Upon coming by Kamaalaea, Eleio’s sister who was residing at this place saw that her brother was out of breath, so she took down her pau and exposed herself to the spirit. This action so shamed the spirit that it abandoned Eleio. The name of this sister of Eleio was Pohakuloa. Being chased by this spirit on three different occasions along this same road, Eleio upon his next return trip went around the west side of Hana by way of Kaupo. Upon his arrival at Kaupo one day he found a woman by the name of Kanikaniaula sitting by the roadside, but he passed right along without noticing her. Kanikaniaula at this want of respect on the part of Eleio called out after him: “Say, are you going to pass right along without greetings?” When Eleio heard this call he turned back and greeted her. Kanikaniaula then invited him to the house which invitation was accepted by Eleio."
"Ia ia i hiki ai i Kaupo, e noho ana keia wahine i ke alanui, o Kanikaniaula ka inoa; kaha loa mai o Eleio hele ma ke alanui, kahea mai o Kanikaniaula: “Ea! Hele loa no ka, aole ka e aloha mai.” A lohe o Eleio i keia leo, huli aku la ia a aloha aku la. I mai o Kanikaniaula, e hoi ma ka hale, ae aku o Eleio.

Ua huna loa ia me ka ike ole o kana kane a hiki i kona la make, aole no hoi oia i olelo i kona alii ana.","Let us here take up a short sketch of Kanikaniaula. Kanikaniaula at the time when this conversation was taking place was dead. Although she appeared in the form of a live person it was really in spirit. Kanikaniaula was a very fine woman and came from a line of high chiefs of Hawaii. She, however, upon coming to live in Kaupo, Maui, married a person of low rank who lived in [ ] the back country. Their time was spent chiefly in the tilling of the soil and the preparation of food, stock raising and fishing. This was kept up until the death of Kanikaniaula. Upon her death the husband built a tomb, a small house of poles in the form of a pyramid, in which he placed the dead body of his wife. When she came to Maui to live she brought along with her from Hawaii a feather cape which was the insignia of a very high chief, but which article she had hidden up to the time of her death, nor had she ever once alluded to her rank as a high chiefess."

Ae mai o Kanikaniaula: “Ae, o ko’u haku ia; eia nae kahi makana au e lawe aku ai ia ia, he ahuula.” Ia wa ike ke kane, he ’lii o Kanikaniaula. “E hoi oe, a na po o Kane kii mai oe ia’u; e holo au i Hawaii i ko’u wahi, i keia mau la a hoi mai.” Hoi mai la o Eleio, me ka ahuula i kona a-i, e aahu ana. O ka ahuula, aole i loaa ia Kakaalaneo ko Maui alii.","When Eleio arrived at the house he saw a man occupying it but the woman was not to be seen. Eleio then asked the man: “Where is my companion?” The man asked in turn: “Who is your companion?” Eleio answered: “My companion was a woman.” “ She is dead, my own wife, she is laid in that small house yonder,” said the man. Eleio then asked the man: “How many days has she been lying there?” The husband answered: “Two days already, this is the third day in which we are speaking.” “Yes, I will undertake to bring your wife to life again,” said Eleio. Eleio then proceeded, and at the end of the fourth day Kanikaniaula was brought back to life and in all respects became as she was before her death. Kanikaniaula then asked Eleio: “What indeed shall I give you as a recompense? Shall it be myself?” Eleio answered: “I will not take anything in payment from you, but I wish you to become the wife of my lord, Kakaalaneo.” Kanikaniaula consented to this, saying: “Yes, he shall be my lord; but here is a present which I wish you to take to him; a feather cape.” At this the husband for the first time was made aware that Kanikaniaula was a chiefess. “You may now return and in the nights of Kane you may come for me. I am going to my place on Hawaii, and shall return in a few days.” Eleio then returned [home] wearing the feather cape tied around his neck. Feather capes at this time were so rare that even Kakaalaneo the king of Maui did not have one in his possession."
"Ma keia hele loihi ana o Eleio, ua huhu ke ’lii o Kakaalaneo, a kena ae la ia i kona mau ilamuku, e hoa ka umu a enaena, i umu e kalua ai ia Eleio ke hoi mai. Ua hoonoho aku o Kakaalaneo i na kiu e kiai i ka hoi mai o Eleio i ka pali o Aalaloloa, a ike i ka hoi mai, alaila, e hoa mai ko laila ahi i ike ko Lele nei poe, alaila, hoa ka umu i enaena mamua o ka hiki ana o Eleio. A hiki o Eleio ma ka pali o Aalaloloa, hoa ke ahi, ike ko Lele poe hoa i ka umu.","As Eleio had been absent a number of days, Kakaalaneo became very angry and ordered his chief officers to start an umu and make it very hot, in which to bake Eleio upon his return. In the meantime Kakaalaneo had posted spies along the Aalaloloa cliffs to watch for the return of Eleio, and when seen to start a fire as a signal to the people at Lele of his approach when the umu was to be started and made hot before the arrival of Eleio; so when Eleio arrived at the Aalaloloa cliffs, the fire signal was started and the people at Lele started the umu."
"Ma keia holo ikaika ana o Eleio me ka aahu i ka ahuula ma kona kua, a hiki i Lele, kahi o ka umu e hoa ia ana, e noho ana o Kakaalaneo ke ’lii.

When the king saw something red and pretty on Eleio’s shoulders, he called out to the men: “Seize Eleio! Seize Eleio!!” At this the people got ahold of Eleio and he was pulled out of the umu and was saved; but the feather cape was torn to pieces: a small piece, however, was saved in the hands of Eleio. Kakaalaneo then called Eleio to come to him and when he got in the presence of the king, the king asked him: “Where did you get this beautiful thing?” Eleio replied: “This was the cause of my delay. Kanikaniaula, a very handsome woman was dead and I brought her to life again. I have told her that you are to be her husband.” Kakaalaneo [ ] then asked Eleio: “Why didn’t you bring her along with you then?” Eleio replied: “I am to go and bring her in the nights of Kane.”"
"A hiki o Eleio i Kaupo, i na po o Kane, ua hoi mai o Kanikaniaula mai Hawaii mai, me na ’lii, me na kanaka, me na aahu ahuula.

When they reached Lele and stood before the king Kakaalaneo then took Kanikaniaula and they dwelt together, husband and wife. Not very long after this Kanikaniaula conceived a child."
"O keia hookauhua ana o Kanikaniaula, ke ’lii wahine, o ka loaa ana ia o Kaululaau, ka mea nana i huhuki ka ulu o Lele a hiki i keia la.

"A nui o Kaululaau, nui pu me na keiki a pau loa (i loko o ia kau e noho ana no kona makuakane o Kakaalaneo i alii no Maui a puni), pii ke kino o Kaululaau i ka nui pii pu me ke kalohe.

The intention of the king being, to procure servants and playmates for the coming heir. In due course of time the queen gave birth to a baby boy and he was called Kaululaau. All the children who were born on the same day on Maui were brought to the king and reared with the prince Kaululaau. As Kaululaau grew to manhood, so also grew his playmates, and as he grew older he became more and more mischievous. His father Kakaalaneo was then still king of Maui. In those days it was customary for the boys with him to climb the breadfruit trees and pick the fruit; and when the fruit got fewer and beyond their reach, Kaululaau would then pull up the trees with his hands. This was done so often that the trees became scarce in the district of Lele. At last the father Kakaalaneo, took pity on the people knowing that they would some day go hungry; so he ordered that all the boys be sent home to their parents, believing that this would make his son less mischievous; but instead of improving he grew worse. After considering the matter for some time, the father at last hit upon a course of action and thereupon told the queen and attendants to take Kaululaau and abandon him on Lanai with the spirits. This was agreed on by the chiefs and people and preparations were immediately made; the food and meat were cooked, kapa and other things were gotten ready and the canoes set out with Kaululaau. Upon their arrival at Lanai, Kaululaau was put ashore with all the things prepared for him and the canoes returned."
"A noho o Kaululaau i Lanai, komo aku la ia i loko o ka moku akulikuli a moe iho la. I loko o ka moe, olelo mai la kona aumakua ia ia: “E Kaululaau e!

Ninau mai la ke akua: “I hea kou wahi i moe ai i keia po?” “ I ka nalu uuku, i ka nalu nui ae oukou,” pela aku o Kaululaau.","When Kaululaau landed on Lanai he entered a patch of reeds and slept there. While in his sleep his god came to him and said: “Say, Kaululaau, get up and enter the cave with all your belongings.” When Kaululaau woke up he looked about him and saw a cave opening near by; so he got up and entered it in obedience to the instructions given him in his sleep. Lanai was an island of spirits. No people could live on this island as the spirits killed and eat everybody who came there. Kaululaau was, however, an exception to this as he was not eaten up; but this was because he was too cunning in telling falsehoods, just like Punia. [ ] That night Kaululaau slept in the cave and at daylight he left it and returned to the patch of reeds where he was found by the spirits who asked him: “Say, Kaululaau, where did you sleep last night?” Kaululaau replied: “In the small patch of thistles.” “Is that so? No wonder you were not found last night,” remarked the spirits. On the approach of the next night he again entered the cave, when the spirits went about looking for him the whole night. At daylight Kaululaau went to the beach on the dry sand and sat there where the spirits came and asked him: “Where did you sleep last night?” “In the patch of thorny vines growing there. That is the place where I slept.” The spirits again asked him: “Where are you going to sleep tonight?” Kaululaau replied: “In the large surf where it rolls as high as a house. That is where I will sleep.” On the approach of night Kaululaau would again retire to the cave, and at daylight go out on the sand where he would be met by the spirits who would ask him: “Where did you sleep last night?” “In the small surf; you were all at the large surf,” Kaululaau would reply."
"Ma keia hana hoopunipuni a Kaululaau, ua pau loa ke akua i ka make, a koe kakaikahi ke akua. O Pahulu ke akua i pakele, no kona holo ana mai Lanai aku a Kahoolawe; o Kaululaau hoi, e hoa mau ana ia i ke ahi i na la a pau loa o kona noho ana ma Lanai.

[ ]","Through these deceiving answers the spirits got so overworked that they mostly all died off, leaving but very few of them alive. Pahulu was one of the spirits that was saved, because he left Lanai and went over to Kahoolawe to live. Kaululaau after this kept a fire burning all the time he remained on Lanai. Kakaalaneo upon seeing the fire burning on Lanai so continuously, asked the people: “Say, Kaululaau could not have been killed by the spirits?” “No,” replied the people. Therefore, Kakaalaneo sent some people in a canoe to go to Lanai and see if Kaululaau was indeed still alive or not. When the canoe arrived at Lanai, the people saw that Kaululaau was indeed still alive and he was still keeping the fire burning. The canoe then returned to Lele and the people told Kakaalaneo, the king, of what they had seen. When the king heard this he remarked: “Yes, he was sent to Lanai to be devoured by the spirits, but no! What does it mean? Well and good.” He then ordered a double canoe to go and bring Kaululaau home. This is how Kaululaau was saved and his history and life on Lanai has become famous even unto this day. [ ]"

The name Nihooleki was given to his spirit body; his name during his life time was Keahaikiaholeha, a chief, and was the greatest fisherman over all the whole country of Waianae. It was he that owned the mother-of-pearl fish-hook called Pahuhu that could catch so much aku. He was at one time king of Waianae and had fished from all the head lands round about that country. He knew all the fish and fishing grounds in the ocean around that region. After a time he left his parents and young sister in Waianae and set sail for Waimea, Kauai, where he settled; for this was where his wife had come from, being her birthplace. [ ]"
"Ia Kaehaikiaholeha i hiki ai ilaila, lilo ae la no ia i alii no Kauai a puni, no ka mea, he ’lii kana wahine no Kauai a puni. O kana hana o ka lawaia i na la a pau loa, me ua pa ai nei ana o Pahuhu.

O kona mau waa e holo ai i ka lawaia, he mau kaulua, he umi ka loa, he iwakalua hoewaa, oia no hoi na kaohi.","When Keahaikiaholeha arrived at Waimea he became the king of the whole of Kauai as his wife was its high chiefess. It was his custom to go out fishing every day. This mother-of-pearl fish-hook, Pahuhu, was a great hook; every time it was let down into the sea and pulled up the aku would follow it into the canoe until the canoe was filled with them. The canoe in which he used to go fishing was a double canoe ten fathoms in length, and was manned by twenty paddlers who were its complement to steady the canoe while he fished for aku."
"A make o Kaehaikiaholeha, hoihoi ia mai a Kuukuua, i Waianae, waiho ia kona kino kupapau; i loko o ka hale puoa, o na makua, hana iho la laua ma ke ano hoomana o Hawaii nei, a ikaika ka uhane i ka hele mehe kanaka ola ala.

The parents then proceeded to worship the spirit, as was the custom in those days of Hawaii, until it became so strong that it could go about in the form of a live person. After the spirit of Keahaikiaholeha had waxed strong, it returned to Waimea, Kauai, and again took his former wife and lived with her as her husband. The wife was not aware that this was her husband’s spirit, fully believing that it was her husband in real flesh. It was while in this spirit form, that he was named Nihooleki. All he did during the day time was to sleep, not even taking food; the wife being the only one that took food. When the wife got hungry she would go to her brothers for food and meat. On one of her calls for food and meat the brothers asked her: “Where is your husband?” The sister replied: “He is at home asleep.” “You have a queer husband. All he does is to sleep at home. How is he to satisfy his wife’s hunger? Except we help you, you will not be able to live.” While this conversation was going on between them, the husband heard all that was being said and when the wife arrived home Nihooleki asked his wife: “Have your brothers any mother-of-pearl fish-hooks?” “They have some.” “Go and bring one.” When the sister arrived at her brothers’ they asked her: “What have you come for?” “I have come for a mother-of-pearl fish-hook for your brother-in-law.” “That is right, that will get you something to live on. Here is a hook for the use of which we will charge ten aku. Here is another one for twenty aku,” etc. The wife took one of the hooks and returned. When she entered the house and approached where her husband was sleeping she called out:"
"E ala e Nihooleki, E ala e Nihooleki, Kaihele ka po, Kaihele ke ao, He mau maka hia-a ko ka lawaia, E ala eia ka pa a kaua.","Wake up Nihooleki, Wake up Nihooleki, The night comes and goes, The day comes and goes; The fishermen have sleepless eyes. Wake up, here is our mother-of-pearl fish-hook."
"Ninau aku ke kane: “Heaha ka pa?” “He lalakea,” pela mai ka wahine. “He pa ai ole.”","The husband asked: “What kind of a mother-of-pearl fish-hook is it?” “It is one resembling the glitter of a white shark,” answered his wife. “It is the one the fish will not bite at.”"
"Elua no aku, Na ke ’kua kane, Na ke ’kua wahine, O na lima o na kaohi ke oopa. Auhea la kahi pahuhu iki, A kane i ai a koe koena, [ ] E kau ana ma ka hakala, E kiai ana ka Noio, E lawe ana ke au i Makaena? Kahi i laha mai ai ke aku, Kuhi ka lima lea ka haawi, Ai ka mauwale, Ai ka pehu o uka o Waiahulu e.","It will catch but two aku. One for the male spirit, One for the female spirit. The arms of the paddlers would become uselessly lame. Where is the small pahuhu, The one partly eaten by Kane? [ ] Hanging there at the gable end Being watched by a noio. The current is flowing towards Makaena Where swarm the aku, Where the giving would be a pleasure, When the worthless could have a share, When the hungry up at Waiahulu could also have a share."
"Hele hou ka wahine a hiki i na kaikunane: “Heaha kau?” “I olelo mai nei kuu kane, aohe ai o ka pa, elua no ka aku, aole e lea ka haawi.” I mai na kaikunane: “A auhea ka pa ai?” Olelo mai nei kuu kane aia ka i ka hakala o ka hale kahi i kau ai, he Noio ke kiai.

A hiki ka wahine me ka pa i ko laua hale, e moe ana no ke kane, kahea iho la: “E ia ka pa, he Pahuhu,” olelo ae o Nihooleki.","At this the wife again returned to the brothers. “What is it you want?” [they asked]. “My husband says the fish-hook is no good; it will catch but two aku and one cannot at that rate give any away willingly,” replied the sister. The brothers again asked: “Where is the fish-hook that would induce the fish to bite more freely?” “My husband said that it is the one hanging up at the gable end of the house being watched by the noio.” When they made a search sure enough they found a mother-of-pearl fish-hook that was being watched by the small black bird; it was Pahuhu. The noio was the supernatural bird sister of Nihooleki. Upon the arrival of the wife at their house, the husband was still asleep. She then called: “Here is the mother-of-pearl fish-hook.” “It is a Pahuhu,” Nihooleki answered."
"He pa ai ia, Kuhi ka lima, Lea ka haawi, Ai ka mauwele, Ai ka pehu o uka, O Waiahulu e.","That is the mother-of-pearl fish-hook that the fish want, You can then point with the hand, You can give with pleasure. The worthless can share, The hungry can also have a share Up at Waiahulu."
"Kiola iho la ka wahine i ka pa a ka poho lima o ia nei; ala ae la keia honi, a uwe iho la; o ke kumu o keia uwe ana, o kona kaawale ana i loko o ka make, a kaawale kana mau oihana lawaia.

He then rose, kissed it and wept over it. The reason why he wept was, because of his death he was thus kept away from his one great pleasure, fishing. After the fish-hook was secured, Nihooleki said to his wife: “Go and get a canoe from your brothers. Not the one of five fathoms in length, nor the single canoe, but get me the double one that is ten fathoms in length. After you have secured the canoe, ask for twenty paddlers.” When the wife arrived in the presence of her brothers, they asked her: “Here you are again, what do you want?” She replied: “I want a canoe.” “Yes, you shall have one, take the one that is five fathoms in length.” “That is not the one he wants. He wants a double canoe that is ten fathoms in length.” “That cannot be. There is no double canoe of that size, nor would he be able to make use of it.” The sister replied: “He said there is such a canoe. It is in the canoe shed.” When a search was made they found one."
"A loaa na waa, kau na kanaka he iwakalua, hoe a hiki imua o Nihooleki, ike iho la no ia o kona mau waa no i ka wa e ola ana. I aku ia i ka wahine: “He punahele no oe i ou kaikunane?” “Ae.” “O hele a olelo aku, o na kanaka he iwakalua i mau kaohi na’u.” [ ]",When the canoe was secured the twenty paddlers jumped aboard and took it to Nihooleki. When Nihooleki saw the canoe he knew at once it was the same one that was owned by him when he was alive. He then asked his wife: “Are you a favorite with your brothers?” “Yes.” “Go and tell them that I want twenty men to steady the canoe with.” [ ]
"A makaukau na hoewaa, a me ka waa, oioi mai la lakou a kokoe i ke awa, no ko lakou manao i ke kani-hana-moa e holo ai i ka lawaia, e like me ke ano mau o na lawaia, aole ka ’uanei peia.

At the first crow of the cock the men got to the canoe; at the last crowing of the cock they pushed the canoe out. By this time all the other fishermen were out at sea. The men, however, still waited until daylight. When it became light enough to distinguish the features of the men they went back to the house feeling indifferent."
"O Nihooleki, ke moe nei me ka noonoo no. Hoala iho la ka wahine: “E ala, e holo, o ka wa oluolu keia o ka lawaia ana, aole e ohea i ka la.” “Pela a ao, a puka ka la.” Ala ae la o Nihooleki, a ke ka, a ka hokeo, hume i ka malo, hele aku la a na waa panee aku la, hookahi lima, lana ana na waa i loko o ke kai, holo mai la na hoewaa a kau iluna.

The wife aroused him: “Wake up and make a start; this is the coolest time for the fishermen, when one is not made lazy by the heat of the sun.” He answered: “Wait until it is light; at sunrise.” Nihooleki then arose, got the bailing cup, reached for the calabash in which were kept all the fishing utensils, affixed his malo, then went out to the canoe and with one hand pushed it out into the sea. The paddlers then came down and jumped aboard. As soon as they got under way Nihooleki took out the fish-hook and began fishing. The aku came in such large numbers that in no time the canoe was loaded. They took this catch and threw it ashore. They went out and got a second canoe load and again it was thrown ashore. This was kept up until six canoe loads had been landed. By this time a large mound of fish had been piled up. The wife proceeded to give away, feed the pigs, give some to the loafers, sell some, and salt some, but a large number were still left over, there being so many. The people from the uplands came down with food, sugar-cane, bananas and everything else good to eat and all went home with fish, even those that came down without anything went home with their share. Those who were still in the uplands when they heard of the fish came down and returned with their share."

When his brothers-in-law saw his well-formed body they called out, “Puipuiakalawaia,” making this his third name. Upon their arrival at Makaena, off Waianae, the men looked up and saw that they had reached the island of Oahu. Nihooleki again fished until the canoe was filled with aku. He then ordered his men to eat. After their meal when every one was satisfied the remaining fish were thrown out until the canoe was bare, when they set off until they landed at Kaunolu, in Lanai, where they again caught some fish and eat till satisfied. Again they set sail until they reached Keauhou, at Kona, Hawaii, when Nihooleki told his men: “You may all go ashore here while I remain with our canoe. When you go ashore, take each of you one aku apiece. There are twenty of you, making twenty aku. When you get to that shed of coconut leaves in front of that house, where women are seated, throw down the fish, but don’t look back.” The men then went ashore while Nihooleki turned the canoe around. On the return of the men they immediately set sail for Kauai, and the same day reached the Kauai waters where the brothers-in-law were fishing. Nihooleki produced the hook and again the aku came tumbling into the canoe until it was sunk deep in the water with fish. When the brothers-in-law looked up they saw the canoe and the fish; the canoe was so full that the men had to stand up. Upon their return to shore Nihooleki took up two aku for the male and female spirits, [ ] took a bath and went home, and told his wife: “Go to the paddlers and give them that canoe load of fish.” He then went in and laid down. The fish from the first catch were beginning to get spoiled."
"Hoi aku la no keia moe. O ka ia mua, ua pilau. Pela no ka lawaia ana a loihi na la, kui aku la keia pihe ia a lohe o Kamapuaa, i uka o Waiohulu, olelo iho o Kamapuaa: “Na’u ia ia o kuu hiki ole i kai.” O Kamapuaa, he aikane na Nihooleki, a o Kamapuaa hoi, he pehu kona mai, aohe hiki i ka hele; nolaila, auamo na kanaka, a o ke kaumaha haalele, pela no ka iho ana a hiki i kai. Mamua o ka holo ana o Nihooleki i ka lawaia, olelo aku i ka wahine: “I iho mai auanei ke kanaka pehu, o ko kane ia kahea ia aku, o kuu aikane ia.”","This was kept up for many days and everybody had fish. One day the news about the great catches was carried to Kamapuaa in the uplands of Waiohulu. Kamapuaa upon hearing the great catches said: “I could get some of that fish if I can only get down to the coast.” Kamapuaa was the friend of Nihooleki; he was afflicted with the dropsy and was not able to walk; therefore some people carried him down to the beach; but being very heavy the men could only carry him a little ways at a time. By constant begging he however managed to get to the seashore. Before Nihooleki set out on a certain day to fish he gave his wife the following instruction: “In case a man with the dropsy should come, call him in as he is my friend.”"
"A hala aku o Nihooleki i ka lawaia, hiki o Kamapuaa a kiai ana i ka puka o ka hale: “Kanaka pilau, hele pela,” pela mai ka wahine.

Kamapuaa with the men that carried him down, went over to the hog pen and there waited for the return of Nihooleki his friend. When Nihooleki returned with the fish, he came and kissed his friend, and then turned to his wife and said: “You are indeed strange. I told you to take good care of my friend, but you have not done so. Never mind, you may stay, but I am going along with my friend.” He then told his friend to give some of the fish to the men who brought him down. The men took all they could carry away, but still many fish were left."
"A makaukau laua e haalele ia Waimea a me ka wahine, i aku o Nihooleki i ka wahine: “O ke keiki au e hapai nei, kapa iho oe i kuu inoa, o Kaehaikiaholeha; eia ka hoailona ke imi ae ia’u, o kuu laau a me kuu ahuula.” A lohe ka wahine i keia kauoha, uwe iho la.

[ ]","When Nihooleki and Kamapuaa were ready to leave Waimea and the wife, Nihooleki addressed his wife saying: “When you give birth to the child within you, call him by my name, Keahaikiaholeha. Here are the tokens by which I shall know him should he search for me, my club and my feather cape.” When the wife heard these instructions she wept: by these words the wife knew that this was her own husband, Keahaikiaholeha. When the chiefs and his brothers-in-law heard that this was the king, they came chasing after him. He and his friend then dove into the sea and swam under water until they came up at Kuukuua, at Waianae. One of the Kauai chiefs, however, came following behind them named Pohakuokauai, the same being that rock which is seen at Waianae even to this day. As they drew near to the house where the parents and sister of Nihooleki were living and near to the tomb where his dead body was laid, Nihooleki then turned to his friend and said: “Where are you? When you reach our parents ask them: ‘Where is my companion that came along with me?’ They will then give you an answer. Then ask them where certain things that belonged to me are. Proceed and take up the threshold where you will find my war helmet; under the place where our sister sleeps you will find a feather cape; at the foot of her sleeping place you will find the lei palaoa; and at the corner in the house is a kahili. Take our sister and make her your wife as she is fair to look upon and is also of proper age.” At the close of his friend’s instructions, Kamapuaa continued on his way until he came in the presence of his friend’s parents and sister. After proving himself a friend of Nihooleki’s by producing the different articles in obedience to the instructions given him by his friend he was married to the sister of Nihooleki. Keahaikiaholeha, who was Nihooleki, entered the tomb and disappeared. Thus ends this story. [ ]"

Kuaikalolo and Aiakoake were the elders of Kepakailiula. Kiinoho and Kiihele were the brothers of Hina. All Kiinoho did was to sit in one place and very seldom moved around; he was, however, a very great fortune teller and could predict coming events that happen in the very near future as well as events afar off. All that Kiihele did was to travel. He was a great runner and could make the circuit of Hawaii in one day, starting from home in the morning and arriving home before sunset of the same day. These people were chiefs of the district of Puna, of very high rank, as were their ancestors before them."

Kiihele was, however, very indifferent about the matter and did not believe in what Kiinoho told him. Shortly after this they both had the same dream repeated to them. At daylight they talked the matter over and decided that they must accept the invitation and go and live in Paliuli. They then made their preparations and procured certain things by the lau (four hundred), such as hogs, awa, fish, fowls, kapas and malos. That night they retired early and at the second crowing of the cock in the early dawn, while it was still dark, they got up and started for Paliuli without the knowledge of their sister or people."
"Ua olelo ia ma keia kaao, o ka mua keia o ka loaa ana o Paliuli i ke kanaka, mai ke ’kua mai, a mahope hoi hou i ke ’kua, nolaila, nalo o Paliuli a hiki i keia la.","It is said in this story that this was the first time that Paliuli was found by man, through the direction of the gods. Afterwards it was again taken away from man by the gods and it has been hidden ever since."

They began to cultivate the soil, raised different animals until the place was filled with everything imaginable. The sugar-cane grew until it fell over and rose again, the bananas fell scattering, the hogs grew until the tusks were long; the chickens until their spurs were long and sharp; and the dogs until their backs were broadened out."
"I aku o Kiihele ia Kiinoho: “Kupanaha kaua, nawai la auanei e ai keia mau mea a kaua e hana nei?” I mai la o Kiinoho: “Na ke keiki a kaua na Kepakailiula. [ ] E kii kaua.” Iho aku la laua mai Paliuli aku a hiki i Keaau, kahi o ko laua kaikuahine, o Hina e noho ana.","One day Kiihele said to Kiinoho: “How queer of us to care for all these things! Who is going to eat them?” Kiinoho replied: “Our son Kepakailiula. Let us go and [ ] bring him here.” They then proceeded from Paliuli and went down to Keaau, where their sister Hina was living."
"Eia hoi, mamua aku o ko laua hoi ana i Paliuli, e hookauhua ana o Hina i ke keiki, a hiki hou laua, ua hapai o Hina, aole nae i hanau. A pau ke aloha ana a me ka uwe ana, eu ae la o Hina e hele i waho e hoolualu ai. I aku o Kiinoho ia Kiihele. “E kii aku oe i ke keiki.” I mai o Kiihele: “Aia ihea?” “Aia i kahi e noho la o Hina.” A hiki o Kiihele i kahi o Hina i noho ai, e waiho ana he huamoa. Lawe ae la keia a wahi i ka ahuula o ka manu. Hoi aku la laua a hiki i Paliuli, hana iho la o Kiinoho ma kona mana, a hala ke anahulu oia he umi po, wehe aku la i ka ahuula, ua kino, he keiki maikai loa, a nana iho la laua aohe ona lua e ku ai. Waiho hou laua a hala na anahulu eha (oia he kanaha po), nana hou laua, he keu o ka nani a me ka maikai. Aohe puu, aohe kee, pali ke kua, mahina ke alo; o kona ili a puni, ua like me ka ahuula ka ula o ka ili a me na maka. Ua lilo o Kepakailiula i ahi no Paliuli, ka ula mau i ke ao a me ka po, no kona maikai loa, a o kona lua e like ai, o ka pele o Kilauea.

Nolaila, ua kapaia o Kepakailiula: “O ka hiapo o ka Hiwahiwa o Paliuli.”","Before these two went to Paliuli, however, Hina showed signs of being with child. Upon their return she was almost ready to be confined. After greetings were exchanged and their weeping ended, Hina rose and went out to relieve herself. As Hina rose to go out, Kiinoho requested Kiihele to go out, saying: “Go out and get the child.” Kiihele asked: “Where is it?” “At the place where Hina is sitting.” When Kiihele came to the place he saw an egg lying on the ground. He took it up and wrapped it in a feather cape; and they returned to Paliuli, where Kiinoho exercised all his powers and at the expiration of ten days and nights he unwrapped the feather cape and saw the egg had formed into a beautiful child; after inspecting it they concluded there was none like him. The child was again wrapped up in the feather cape and left for a period of forty nights before they again looked at it. When they did they saw that the child had grown more beautiful; no pimples, no deformities, straight back, open face; its skin and eyes were as red as the feather cape which enwrapped him. Thus did Kepakailiula become the fire that lighted up Paliuli by day and by night, whose only equal was Pele of Kilauea. Pele gave light from the crater of Kilauea, while Kepakailiula gave light from Paliuli, giving Puna and Hilo two red objects to view by day and by night. Kepakailiula was therefore called “The first-born of the beloved one of Paliuli.” Kepakailiula would not touch either ordinary food or meat; all he eat was bananas, one bunch for each meal."
"Aohe ai o Kepakailiula i ka ai a me ka ia, hookahi ana mea ai o ka maia, hookahi ahui, hookahi ai ana. Nana aku o Kiinoho a me Kiihele i ke keiki, a o ka wahine ole, i iho: “U!

He looked her over and admired her beauty; yes, she was indeed good looking, but she had one fault, her eyes bulged out like the nut of the kukui. He therefore gave up Kukuilauania and continued his search, passing from Hilo into Hamakua. Failing to find one to his liking, he passed on into Kohala where he was still unable to find a woman. After looking over the dark rocks of Kaniku he decided to return. Upon his arrival at Paliuli, Kiinoho asked him: “How was your journey?” Kiihele replied: “I have found no wife.” On this same day, he [again left Paliuli and] continued his search into Puna, until he met a woman by the name of Kahala. She was very beautiful, except that her posterior resembled the pandanus fruit of the present day, so he passed on into Kau where he found Manienie. She too was very beautiful, but her lips were deformed so he discarded her and continued his search, Kiihele left Kau and passed into Kona where he found Makolea, a woman who was as faultless as the full moon. Kahaluu was her father and Keauhou was her mother. Makolea, however, had been pledged to marry Kakaalaneo the king of Maui, for Makolea was a princess, her parents being the king and queen of Kona. [ ] When it was reported that Kakaalaneo was so expert a spearsman, that he could hit a blade of grass, an ant, or a flea, at one throw of the spear, the parents became afraid and gave Makolea to Kakaalaneo."
"Hele aku la o Kiihele a ku ma ka puka o ka hale o Makolea, aloha aku la keia: “Aloha olua.” Aloha mai la o Makolea a me kona kahu. Ma ko laua ike ana mai ia Kiihele, he kanaka maikai loa imua o ko Kona poe iho, a hoohie, a hookohukohu mai la ka laua la kamailio. Kahea mai la laua la: “Komo mai,” komo aku la o Kiihele a ma ka nio o ka puka noho iho la. Ninau mai la o Makolea: “Mahea mai oe?” I aku o Kiihele: “Maanei mai nei.” “Heaha kau huakai o keia la hao?” “He imi wahine.” “Nau no?” pela mai o Makolea. I aku o Kiihele: “Na ka maua keiki.” I mai o Makolea: “Me oe iho la no ka maikai?” “Aole, he ili wawae ko’u maikai no kona maikai.” A lohe ke ’lii wahine i keia olelo a Kiihele, ua hakui kona puuwai e launa koke. I aku ia Kiihele: “O kii hoi ha i ka’u kane a lawe mai, mai lohi oe.”","Kiihele approached the house in which Makolea was living and stood by the door and saluted the two people within, which salutation was returned by Makolea and her attendant. At the sight of Kiihele, Makolea and her attendant were much impressed with his manliness and beauty, being much superior to that of the people of Kona; so they were over anxious to please him and his call was made very pleasant. The two then invited Kiihele to enter, which invitation was accepted and Kiihele entered and sat down by the door. Makolea then asked him: “Where are you from?” Kiihele answered: “I came along the road.” “What is the object of this unannounced visit?” “I am in search of a wife.” “For yourself?” asked Makolea. “For our son,” answered Kiihele. “Is he as handsome as yourself?” continued Makolea. “No, I am but as the skin on his feet.” When the princess heard the answers made by Kiihele, she became excited and wanted to meet the young man right away; so she told Kiihele: “Go and bring the man whom you wish to be my husband and don’t be slow.”"
"Hoi aku la o Kiihele a hiki i Paliuli, ninau mai o Kiinoho: “Pehea kau huakai?” I aku o Kiihele: “Ua loaa ka wahine no Kona, o Makolea.” Ae mai o Kiinoho: “Ae, he wahine maikai na, ua palama ia a na Kakaalaneo ke ’lii o Maui.” (Ma kona ike kilokilo keia olelo.) “A hea hele kakou?” “Aia a apopo, a kela la aku, pela wau i olelo aku nei.” Hookahi no keia la a Kiihele, e hele nei a hoi i Paliuli.","Kiihele at once returned to Paliuli and upon his arrival, Kiinoho asked him: “How was your journey?” Kiihele replied: “I have found a wife in Kona, Makolea by name.” Kiinoho said: “Yes, she is a handsome woman; she is betrothed to Kakaalaneo the king of Maui (he was able to know this through his knowledge as a fortune teller). When are we to go to her?” “I told her we were coming on the day after tomorrow.” Kiihele did this all in one day, going and returning to Paliuli."
"I loko o ia mau la, uwe paiauma o Kiinoho a me Kiihele ia Paliuli, i ka haalele, honi i na mea a pau loa, pela laua i aloha ai ia Paliuli. A hiki i ka la e hele ai o lakou, haawi o Kiinoho a me Kiihele ia Paliuli no ke ’kua, oia ka nalo a hiki i keia la o Paliuli, aole ike hou ia.","During the two days before they were to leave Paliuli, Kiinoho and Kiihele wailed and mourned because of their deep attachment for Paliuli and they kissed every object in their beautiful home. When the day of their departure arrived, Kiinoho and Kiihele left Paliuli in charge of the gods; hence the disappearance of Paliuli until this day; no one has ever seen it since."
"A hele lakou, ku ae la o Kiihele me Kepakailiula a hele, me ka paa o ke keiki i ka ahuula, ua wahi ia a paa. O Kiinoho, noho iho la ia, huli hope aku o Kiihele a olelo aku: “Ka!

Kiinoho, however, would not move, so Kiihele turned back and said: “How strange of you, are you to remain when our son is to leave the place?” Upon hearing this Kiinoho followed. On this same day, they reached Kona and the home of Makolea, where Kepakailiula and Makolea became husband and wife. Kepakailiula then spoke to his foster parents: “Here is your wife, Makolea’s attendant; you two must take her as your wife. After you are gone from here, give attention, should I die, continue on; but if I am still alive, then all will be well.” * * *"
"Noho aku la laua hookahi hana o ka moe, a haohao na makua i ka ike ole ia aku o Makolea, no ka mea he wahi kaawale ko laua. Hele mai la laua e nana, a ike iho la laua, he kane ke kumu o ka nalo ana.

Ala mai la o Kepakailiula [ ] a na makua, hele mai la mauka a Kohala, makai na waa me ka wahine. A hiki i Kohala, holo loa na waa i Maui, noho lakou i Kohala.","After Kepakailiula and Makolea had become husband and wife, they did nothing but sleep, so that the parents of Makolea wondered at the continued absence of their daughter; as she lived in a separate house, they decided to come and learn the cause of this absence. When they entered the house they found that a husband was the cause of her disappearance. They immediately took her, placed her in a canoe to sail for Maui, leaving Kepakailiula behind still asleep. When Kepakailiula woke up he went to his foster parents and informed them of what had happened. They then went overland [ ] to Kohala, his wife going by sea with canoes. Upon their arrival there, the canoes continued on to Maui, but they dwelt in Kohala."
"O Kukuipahu ke ’lii o Kohala ia wa, a he wahi kaikamahine hookahi kana, o Kapuaokeonaona kona inoa, aole nae i nui loa, aka, he helehelena maikai kona ke nana aku. Nana mai la o Kukuipahu ia Kepakailiula, a o ke kanaka maikai, lawe ae la ia i keiki ponoi nana, a malama iko la, a olelo aku la o Kukuipahu: “Eia kau wahi wahine kou poohiwi o ka po e moe ai.”","At this time Kukuipahu was the king of Kohala, who had an only daughter named Kapuaokeonaona; she was not very big, but had very pretty features to look at. When Kukuipahu saw Kepakailiula, that he was handsome and manly, he took him to be as his own son, brought him to his home and said: “Here is your wife, your pillow to rest on at night.”"
"Ekolu la i hala i ko lakou noho ana i Kohala, po iho, a moe loko o ka hale, hele aku la o Kepakailiula a ka lae kahakai, ilaila he wahi waa, holo aku la ia i Maui ma Hana, ilaila o Makolea, me Kakaalaneo e noho ana. A pae i uka, nana aku la ia, ua ona o Kakaalaneo i ka awa, i loko o ia ona awa o Kakaalaneo, kahea mai la i ka wahine:","After they had been in Kohala for about three days, on the night of this third day while everybody was asleep, Kepakailiula went to a point on the seashore where a canoe was lying, boarded it and set sail for Hana, Maui, where Makolea was at that time living with Kakaalaneo. Upon landing, he looked and saw that Kakaalaneo was drunk with awa. In his intoxicated condition he called out to Makolea:"
"Makolea, Makolea, Hoi aku oe a ka aleo, Haliilii i ka moena Hoholo ke kapa, ka uluna, Hoi aku kaua ilaila e moe ai.","Makolea, Makolea, Return to the house. Spread out the mat, The bed clothes and pillow For we shall sleep there."
"Hele aku la o Makolea me na wahine, haliilii a paa, hoi mai la. Hiki o Kepakailiula, hana lepo iluna o ka moena a paele. Lawe aku la o Makolea ia Kakaalaneo a luna o ka moena, paele i ka hana lepo. “Kupanaha oe; ua ike no hoi paha oe he lepo ko keia wahi, haliilii no oe. E lawe ka moena a na hope o na waa haliilii, ilaila kaua e moe ai.” Hoi aku la lau a ma ka hope o na waa moe, ke pee nei o Kepakailiula.

Kepakailiula then entered the house and besmeared excrement on the mat. Soon after this Makolea and Kakaalaneo entered and sat on the besmeared mat, when Kakaalaneo said: “How strange of you to spread out the mats on this place knowing that it is covered with filth. Take the mats and spread them at the end of the canoe, where we will retire for the night.” After they had retired thither, Kepakailiula who was in hiding, came out, and when Kakaalaneo was sound asleep, took Makolea in the bushes and there they enjoyed themselves till near dawn. Kepakailiula returned to Hawaii without being seen and, landing at Kohala, went home, entered the house and slept by his young wife. When the king’s breakfast was ready he was called; he rose and took breakfast."
"I ka lua o ka po, pela no ka ia nei hana. A hiki keia i Maui, ma Hana, e moe ana no o Kakaalaneo me Makolea ma hope o na waa, lalau iho la no keia i ka wahine lawe. O ke kane, o Kakaalaneo, lawe aku la keia a ke kiona hana lepo, kukulu i ke poo ilalo, o na wawae iluna, aohe eu ae, ua ona i ka awa. Moe laua a kokoke i ka wa hoi o ia nei, uwe mai o Makolea:","On the second night, he again repeated his visit to Hana, Maui. Upon going ashore he found Kakaalaneo and Makolea asleep back of the canoes; he took his wife away, while he took Kakaalaneo and stood him up on his head on a dung heap, where he remained all night, being drunk with awa. They slept together till it was about time for him to return, when Makolea cried saying:"
"Aloha wale oe i ka make; O kuu kane, he akamai i ka o ihe, Aoe hala ka puamauu, Ka naonao, ka ukulele.","How sad I am of your coming fate. My husband is a skillful spearsman, He never misses a grass blade, An ant, or a flea [ukulele]."
"He hua kona, he hua ko’u. He laho kona, he laho ko’u. He keiki kane ia, he keiki kane au. Aole i akaka na ai, nana paha, na’u paha. [ ]","He has fruit, I have fruit. He has testes, I have testes. He is a male child, I am a male child. No one can say who will win out, whether he, or I. [ ]"
"Olelo aku la o Kepakailiula: “E hoi au, e kali oe, elua la e hala ia’u, i ke kolu hiki au, kukulu oe i lepa nou,” a hoi kela i Kohala.","Kepakailiula then continued, saying: “I am going [home] and you must remain. After two days have passed, on the third day I will be back again. You must put up a flag to show me your whereabouts.” He then set out for Kohala."
"Ala ae la na mea a pau i ke kakahiaka nui, e ku mai ana o Kakaalaneo i ke kiona hoolei lepo, kii ia aku la. O Kakaalaneo, he wahi ike kona ma ke ano kilokilo, e like me Kiinoho. Olelo mai la: “U!

I aku ke kane: “Ke uwe la oe i ko kane ia Kepakailiula; e make ana ia’u kau kane ke ike aku au.”","When everybody woke up in the morning they saw Kakaalaneo standing in the dung heap [head down]: so they hastened and removed him from his uncomfortable position. Kakaalaneo being also a fortune teller, like Kiinoho, after coming to himself, said: “Yes, you have escaped me this time because my eyes have failed me, for my spear never misses a blade of grass, an ant, or a flea, while your shadow is much larger. I will kill you [yet].” When Makolea heard the boast of Kakaalaneo, she wept for Kepakailiula. Her husband upon seeing her weeping said: “You are weeping for Kepakailiula your paramour. I shall kill him when I see him.”"
"A hiki o Kepakailiula i Kohala, moe a hiki i ka wa ala, ninau aku keia i kahi wahine opiopio, ia Kapuaokeonaona: “He punahele no oe i ko makuakane?” Ae mai kela: “Ae, ma ka’u e olelo ai malaila kela.” “Ae, e olelo oe i ko makuakane, o na kanaka a pau o Kohala nei, e holo i ka makaikai me a’u i Maui; aohe kanaka a noho, o ka mea ku ae a hina iho ke noho; o na kane, o na wahine, na keiki e hele; o na waa a pau loa o Kohala nei.”","When Kepakailiula reached Kohala he immediately retired. Upon waking up in the morning, he asked his young wife, Kapuaokeonaona: “Are you much thought of by your father?” She answered: “Yes, he will do whatever I ask him.” “All right then, go to your father and tell him that you wish all the people of Kohala to go to Maui with me on a visit. No one shall stay behind except those that are unable to walk. Ask for all the men, women and children and let all the canoes of Kohala be furnished for this voyage.”"
"A lohe o Kukuipahu, holo ka luna e kala, hookahi la, i ka lua akoakoa, a i ke kolu o ka la holo i Maui. Ua uhi paapu ia ka moana e na waa, aohe ike ia o ka ale. Ma keia holo ana o Kepakailiula me kahi wahine opio, o Kapuaokeonaona, o na makuakane elua, o Kiinoho me Kiihele, a me ka laua wahine, ma ko lakou waa, o Kukuipahu ma kona waa, mahope na waa a pau loa.

On the second day the people came together and on the third day they started for Maui. The ocean was so entirely covered with the canoes that it was impossible to see the waves. On this voyage Kepakailiula and his young wife Kapuaokeonaona, his two foster fathers Kiinoho and Kiihele and their wife were in one canoe; Kukuipahu was all by himself in his canoe, while the rest of the people in their canoes followed behind. The entire distance from Kohala to Hana was covered with the canoes making the Alenuihaha channel look red: hence the old saying, “Kohala is crowded to its uttermost ends with people.” When the canoes reached Hana, Kepakailiula’s canoe was the only one that landed while the others laid to in the offing. Kepakailiula upon jumping ashore was urged upon by his fathers, Kiinoho and Kiihele, that they be permitted to follow him, but their son would not consent to their coming ashore, saying: “No, you two must remain on the canoe, in case of my death in this encounter, you will have your means of escaping to Hawaii, but in case I live then come ashore.”"
"Ua piha o Hana i na ’lii a me na kanaka, ua makaukau no ke kaua a Kakaalaneo ko lakou alii. A lele o Kepakailiula a ku i ke one maloo, uwa ka aha, no ke kanaka maikai.

[ ]","Hana on this occasion was filled with the chiefs and men, who were ready to fight for Kakaalaneo their king. As Kepakailiula stood on the sand, the crowd shouted in admiration of his beauty and manliness. He then walked further inland until he reached solid ground, where he stood twirling his war club called Oleloikahie. Kakaalaneo upon seeing Kepakailiula came up to meet him, holding two spears, one in his right hand and one in his left. Kakaalaneo was noted as a spearsman from Hawaii to Kauai. No chief or soldier equaled him for his great strength. He could hit a blade of grass, an ant, and even a flea with his spear. Because of this great skill and strength, the kings of Hawaii, Oahu and Kauai were afraid of Kakaalaneo. [ ]"
"Olelo mai o Kakaalaneo: “Ia wai ka mua, i ka malihini i ke kamaaina?” I aku o Kepakailiula: “I ke kamaaina ka mua, i ka malihini ka hope.” Ia wa pahu o Kakaalaneo i ka ihe, me ka manao ua ku o Kepakailiula, a kokoke ka ihe, wehe o Kepakailiula i ka poaeae akau, a komo ka ihe, maloko, puliki ae la i ke kino o ka ihe.

Manao iho la o Kakaalaneo ua ku o Kepakailiula i ka ihe ana. Paha iho la:","As Kakaalaneo drew near he said: “Who shall have the first chance? Shall it be the stranger or the son of the soil?” Kepakailiula replied: “Let the son of the soil have the first chance and the stranger the last.” As soon as this was said, Kakaalaneo threw his spear with the full belief that he would hit Kepakailiula. As the spear neared Kepakailiula, he made a quick motion of the right elbow outward and allowed the spear to enter in between his arm and body and then closed his arm again on the spear, as the wind whistled by and the point of the spear quivered. The spear was held this way for a moment and was then thrown onto the dung heap. Kakaalaneo believed he had surely hit Kepakailiula, so expressed his delight in the following chant:"
"Ku aku la i kuu ihe, Aole e hala ka’u ihe ke o; Ku ka puamauu Ka naonao, ka uku, Me oe hoi he aka nui, Make, a o e ola.","I have hit him with my spear, My spear never misses its object when thrown At a blade of grass, At an ant, at a flea, Why should it miss you a larger object? Die, you shall not escape."
"A kiola o Kepakailiula i ka ihe, nana mai la o Kakaalaneo, a olelo mai:","When Kepakailiula threw the spear away, Kakaalaneo looked on and said:"
"Heaha la ka mea i hala ai kuu ihe, I kulaina paha e ke Kona, I oniu ia paha e ka lauawa, Pakele oe i kuu akau Loaa oe i ka ihe o kuu hema. Make oe aole oe e ola.","Why did my spear miss the mark? Was it pushed from its course by a southern storm? Or warded off by the lauawa? You have escaped my right, You shall be caught by the spear in my left. You shall die, you shall not escape."
"Pahu hou o Kakaalaneo, wehe o Kepakailiula i ka poaeae hema, komo ka ihe a paa ke kino ia ia nei, a pau ka ikaika, pahu keia i kahi hoolei lepo, e like me kela ihe mua.

Kepakailiula opened out his left elbow and allowed the spear to pass between the arm and body, when he closed his arm on it and held it there for a moment, then threw it on the dung heap after the first spear. When Kakaalaneo saw that he had again failed and having no other weapon, he turned to flee. Kepakailiula then called out: “Is the mighty one then about to flee?” With this he swung his war club Oleloikahie upwards and struck his opponent between the legs which cut him in two. Kakaalaneo with his last gasp then cried out: “Ye chiefs of Maui, are you then to see me thus die without rendering me some assistance?” At this the Maui chiefs and warriors jumped on Kepakailiula. Kepakailiula dropped his war club and met them with his hands, catching those that came near him and breaking them in two, allowing none of the chiefs to escape. The soldiers when they saw this turned and fled. Kiinoho and Kiihele then jumped ashore and entered into the fight thus making three on their side. Kepakailiula led the fight uprooting the trees and rocks on his way and rolling them onto the enemy. When Kukuipahu saw his son-in-law causing a great slaughter amongst the people he took up the young wife in his arms, ran in front of Kepakailiula and stood her up. When Kepakailiula saw it was his young wife, Kapuaokeonaona, he took her up, placed her on his back and retraced his steps, thus putting a stop to the useless slaughter of the people."
"A ike o Kukuipahu i ka luku a ka hunona i na kanaka, hopu iho la ia i ka wahine opio, holo aku la a mamua o Kepakailiula kukulu iho la. A ike aku la ia, o kahi wahine opio, o Kapuaokeonaona, lalau aku la ia a kau ae la i ke kua, hoi aku la, pau iho la ka luku ana i na kanaka. Lele mai la na kanaka o na waa, pae i uka, kalua ka puaa, ka ai, noho iho la i na hale. I aku o Kepakailiula: “Ina oukou i manao e noho i Maui nei, noho no; ina no hoi e hoi i Kohala e hoi no.” O keia holo ana, ka [ ] hoomaka ana e noho ko Kohala i Maui, nolaila, kamaaina ko Kohala poe ia Maui a hiki i keia la.","The people from the canoes then came ashore, baked the pigs and food and dwelt in the abandoned houses. Kepakailiula after calling the people together addressed them saying: “If you wish to reside on Maui do so, and if you wish to return to Hawaii [ ] you may return.” This voyage to Maui was the commencement of the exodus of the people from Kohala and they became children of the soil of Maui, even to this day."
"I aku o Kepakailiula ia Kukuipahu: “Eia ka aina, o luna, o uka o kai, o oe ke ’lii, o ka moa ko’u.” Lilo ae la o Kukuipahu ke ’lii o Maui a puni. Ua kui aku la ke kaulana o Kepakailiula a hiki i Oahu, a lohe o Kakuhihewa ke ’lii, makau iho la, no ka mea, ua make o Kakaalaneo ka mea akamai i ka o ihe, ke ’lii a Kakuhihewa i makau ai. Nolaila, lawe ae la o Kakuhihewa i ka inoa o Kepakailiula i keiki ponoi nana; olelo aku la ia i kona mau kahu: “E kii oukou i kuu keiki a lawe mai i Oahu nei, e komo i ka aina ona.”","Kepakailiula then turned to Kukuipahu and said: “Behold the land and everything in it. From the mountains to the sea it is yours. You shall be its king, only reserving to myself the rights due a conqueror.” Kukuipahu thus became the king of the whole of Maui."
"A hiki na waa i Maui, a pae ma Hana, i Kapueokahi, ninau lakou: “Auhea ke ’lii o Kepakailiula?” “Aia i kela mau halau nui.” A hiki lakou nei ilaila, ninau no. I mai o Kepakailiula: “Owau.” I aku lakou nei: “I kii mai nei makou ia oe, e holo kakou i Oahu, pela mai ko makuakane o Kakuhihewa, e komo i ka aina.” Ae mai ke ’lii, holo lakou nei; o Kepakailiula, o na wahine elua, o na makuakane elua me ka laua wahine. A hiki lakou i Oahu, a pae ma Waikiki, malaila o Kakuhihewa kahi i noho ai. Haawi mai o Kakuhihewa ia Oahu a puni, ia Kepakailiula. Hoonoho iho la ia i na makuakane i mau alii no Oahu nei; o luna, o lalo, o uka, o kai, o ka moa kona a me Kakuhihewa. Noho iho la laua he mau alii.","The tidings of this great victory of Kepakailiula were carried to Oahu, and when Kakuihewa the king heard of it, he became afraid, because Kakaalaneo the most skillful spearsman, the king greatly feared by him, had been killed by this man. Kakuhihewa therefore took the name of Kepakailiula and made him his son and told his immediate attendants: “Go and bring my son to Oahu that he may enter into his land.” Upon the arrival of the canoes at Maui and landed at Kapueokahi, Hana, the messenger asked: “Where is the chief Kepakailiula?” “In those long large houses.” When the messengers arrived at the houses indicated they again asked for the chief, Kepakailiula answered: “I am he.” The messengers replied: “We have come to take you to Oahu upon the request of your father, Kakuhihewa, that you may enter the land.” The chief consented to this and sailed for Oahu, taking with him his two wives, and his foster fathers with their wife. Upon their arrival at Oahu they landed at Waikiki, where Kakuhihewa was residing at the time. Kakuhihewa then gave the whole of Oahu over to Kepakailiula. Kepakailiula then in turn made his foster fathers the joint kings of Oahu, to have possession of everything on the land, under the land, and from the mountains to the sea, reserving to himself and Kakuhihewa their rights as rulers. The foster fathers thereupon became the joint kings [of Oahu]."
"A hala eha la o ko lakou noho ana ma Waikiki, he mea mau na na kamaaina ka heenalu i na la a pau loa. O Makolea kekahi ma keia heenalu ana, ka wahine a Kepakailiula. O ka nalu o Kalehuawehe ka nalu e hee ai o Makolea. Ia ia malaila e heenalu ana, hiki mai la o Keaumiki, a me Keauka mai Kauai mai, a lawe aku la ia Makolea lilo.","After they had been in Waikiki for about four days they joined with the people of the place in their daily pastime surf-riding. In this day’s sport Makolea, the wife of Kepakailiula also joined in with the bathers and went in surf-riding. Makolea upon joining the bathers took the surf breaking over that place known as Kalehuawehe . While she was enjoying her rides, Keaumiki and Keauka arrived from Kauai and took Makolea away with them."
"O ke ’lii o Kauai o Kaikipaananea, he ’lii ikaika i ka hakoko, i ke kulakulai, i ka honuhonu, aohe ona kanaka e hina ai, he akamai loa i ka nane, nana wale no ke eo. Aole nae ana wahine; o Keaumiki a me Keauka, he mau kiai, a kahu no hoi no Kaikipaananea. A hiki o Makolea i Kauai, lilo ae la i wahine na Kaikipaananea ke ’lii.","The king of Kauai at this time was Kaikipaananea. He was noted for his great strength in wrestling, both in the open way, catch-as-catch-can, and in the style where they get down on all fours. No man at the time was found that could throw him. He was also very skillful in giving and solving riddles; he was known to win on every occasion. He was, however, without a wife. Keaumiki and Keauka were his guardians and immediate attendants. When Makolea arrived at Kauai, she became the wife of Kaikipaananea the king."
"Haohao iho la na mea a pau loa i ka nalowale honua o ke ’lii wahine, manao iho la ua make i ka nalu, a ua lilo i ka moana loa. I aku o Kepakailiula: “Aole i make, ua lilo i ke ’lii o Kauai, ia Kaikipaananea, na Keaumiki a me Keauka i kii mai.” Noho [ ] iho la ia me Kapuaokeonaona, kahi wahine opio, akahi a launa hana laua ma ke kino. Ekolu la i hala, olelo aku o Kepakailiula ia Kakuhihewa: “I wahi waa no’u, no ka mea ke kii aihue hoi kona i ka’u wahine, pela hoi au e holo aihue aku ai.”","Upon the disappearance of Makolea the people were greatly excited and began to think that she must have been killed by the surf and carried out to sea. Kepakailiula, however, said: “No, she is not dead, she has been taken by Keaumiki and Keauka, by the order of the king of Kauai, Kaikipaananea.” He [Kepakailiula] remained with [ ] Kapuaokeonaona, the young woman, with whom he for the first time cohabited. On the third day after the disappearance of Makolea, Kepakailiula asked Kakuhihewa: “I want a small canoe. Since he has come and taken my wife in the way of a thief, I too will adopt the same course.”"

He then started off until he came to a man of note, who was very wealthy, a high chief under Kaikipaananea. When Kepakailiula met him he was taken in and made the friend of this chief. On the next day he asked his friend: “What is the cause of the shouts in that house where the people are gathered?” His friend replied: “That is our king, Kaikipaananea, he is wrestling. After that they will have a boxing match, and then they will give and answer riddles; no one can beat him, he is always the winner.” Kepakailiula again asked: “Can it be seen?” “Why not?” “Let us go there then?” When they arrived the place was packed with people. Kaikipaananea upon seeing Kepakailiula called out: “Say, will the stranger join in the wrestling matches?” “I am not versed in such sport.” “Let us box then.” At this Kepakailiula gave his consent saying: “All right, I know something of that game, but not very much. I am, however, willing to try with the son of the soil.” Upon taking their positions, Kaikipaananea after a while hit Kepakailiula which stunned him and caused him to stagger, but he did not fall. Kepakailiula then struck a blow at Kaikipaananea which knocked him down. He laid on the ground for a period of time long enough to cook an oven of food when he arose and said: “Yes, that was certainly good, you make an interesting opponent.”"
"A kokoke o Kukaea ma kahi a Kepakailiula e noho nei, kahea aku la, e hele mai. I mai ke aikane: “He kanaka ino, he pilo, o ka lepo o ke ’lii kana ai a hiki i keia la. ” I aku ke aikane: “E kahea aku oe.” A hiki o Kukaea, olelo aku la ia Kepakailiula a me ke aikane: “He kanaka ino wau, he lepo ka’u ai, he pilo wau e noho aku la.” I mai la o Kepakailiula: “E hamama ko waha.” Hamama kela, nini ka wai, pau ka pilopilo o ke kino, aahu ke kapa hou, hanai ka ai me ka io o ka puaa, ai keia a maona.

On the day following they again resorted to the king’s games where another boxing match was had in which Kaikipaananea broke an arm. At the close of the games they came home. Soon after they reached home, the king’s public crier, named Kukaea (this man lived on the filth of Kaikipaananea, never having tasted food or meat from his childhood), arrived crying: “Everybody is commanded to be at the king’s audience on the fourth day to answer the king’s riddles. No man, woman or child shall stay at home, excepting those who are unable to walk.” As Kukaea approached the house where Kepakailiula was staying, Kepakailiula called out to the public crier: “Come.” His friend spoke up: “He is a filthy man, he lives on nothing but the king’s excrement.” Kepakailiula answered: “You call him.” When Kukaea came up to them, he said: “I am a filthy man, I live on filth. I am offensive to the smell.” Kepakailiula ordered: “Open your mouth.” Kukaea opened his mouth when water was poured into it and he was requested to wash himself, then new clothes were offered him. Then food and pork were given him and he sat down and eat until he was satisfied. Then he turned to Kepakailiula and said: “What shall I give you in return for your kindness, in giving me food and meat. I have traveled around Kauai but no one ever fed me as you have done this day. Here at last I have found that food and pork are pleasant to the taste. I will pay you by giving you the answers to the king’s riddles, for no other person [ ] knows them but myself, the king’s personal attendant.” Kepakailiula then asked him: “What are his riddles and the answers to them?” “They are these:"
"“Oia ka nane mua. Eia ka haina, he hale a koe ka puka komo.","“That is the first riddle. The answer is house , reserving an opening for the doorway."
"O kanaka i ku, O kanaka i moe, O kanaka i pelupelu ia.","The men that stand, The men that lie down, The men that are folded."
"“Oia ka lua o ka nane, eia kona haina, he hale no, o ka laau e ku ana, o ka aho e moe ana, o ka mauu i pelupelu ia. E hoi au, a hiki ia la, pii ae oe, a na’u no auanei e hoa ka umu, a enaena, hai oe i ka nane mua; a ulu, a lele ke a ma kapa, hai oe i ka lua o ka nane; a pau ia na’u e lalau mai i ke ’lii a hoolei i ka umu.”","“That is the second riddle. The answer is, house , again. The timbers that stand, the battens that are laid down and the grass that is folded. I must go home now. When the day arrives, you must come up. I will prepare the oven and when it is heated you answer the first riddle; and when you see the stones thrown out onto the sides, answer the second riddle; after that I will take ahold of the king and throw him in the oven.”"

As they came in the king saw them and called out: “Let the stranger be seated here.” As soon as he sat down, the king said: “Will the stranger join in the fun?” Kepakailiula replied: “Yes.” “I have two riddles,” said the king. “If the right answers are given to them, I will be baked in the oven. If they are not answered correctly, you will be baked in the oven. These are the conditions.” The king then gave the first riddle."

It is thatched all around, reserving the door way.” “Yes, you have given the right answer to my riddle; my second one is yet to be answered. If you fail, I shall kill you.” Kepakailiula looked at the oven and when he saw the stones being thrown to the side he answered the second riddle:"
"He hale no; He laau ke ku ana, He aho ke moe ana, He mauu ke pelu ana.","It is also a house. The timbers that stand, The battens that are laid down, The grass that is folded."

Who has told you?” While he was expressing his wonder he was thrown in the oven by Kukaea. At this time, the chiefs and men of Kauai jumped in to help their king, but Kepakailiula, his friend and Kukaea fought so well and bravely [ ] that great numbers were slain, forcing the Kauai people to flee to the mountains. Makolea the wife of Kepakailiula was soon after found and they returned to the home of his friend. Upon arriving at the house, Kepakailiula gave Kauai over in charge of his friend with Kukaea under him. They then remained on Kauai for many days. Thus ends this legend. [ ]"
"O Wahanui ke ’lii, o Kilohi ke kaula, o Hawaii ka aina, holo mai la kona mau kaulua mai Hawaii mai, a Kaunolu i Lanai.

Boarding his double canoe, he left Hawaii and set sail for Kaunolu, Lanai. The reason of this journey made by Wahanui was on account of an oath made by him, “When I step on the breasts of Kane and Kanaloa, then will I return to Hawaii.” Before Wahanui sailed from Hawaii, Kane and Kanaloa, together with their younger brother Kaneapua, were living at Kaunolu, Lanai. They were three gods who sometimes changed into other forms. Kane and Kanaloa taking the form of birds, while Kaneapua very often had a human form."
"Noho iho la lakou a make i ka wai, olelo aku o Kane a me Kanaloa ia Kaneapua, ko laua pokii: “E pii oe i wai no kakou, i uka o Lanai,” o Nanaihale ka inoa o ka wai.

Upon the arrival of Kaneapua at the spring with his water jug, he urinated by the edge of the spring before he stooped down to fill his jug; he did not know that his urine had run into the spring. When he arrived home and met Kane and Kanaloa, they reached out for the water jug and each took a drink. When they had satisfied their thirst they discovered that it was urine instead of water, so they flew off and left Kaneapua on Lanai."
"Ia Kaneapua e noho ana ma ka lae o Kaunolu, holo mai ana ka waa o Wahanui, kahea aku o Kaneapua mauka: “Nowai he waa?” “No Wahanui,” pela ’ku ke kaula o Kilohi. “O Wahanui ke ’lii, owai ke kaula?” “O Kilohi.” Ninau hou o Kaneapua: “He waa e holo ana i hea?” “He waa e holo ana i Kahiki, hehihehi i ka houpo o Kane a me Kanaloa.” I aku o Kaneapua: “Pehea la hoi owau kekahi?” Olelo mai o Kilohi: “He komokomo ka waa.” “I ka iako au.” “He komo no.” “I ke ama au.” “He komo.” Pela no ka ia nei olelo a pau luna o ka waa. I aku o Kaneapua: “E hoi he ino.” I mai o Kilohi: “O oe no ka mea e hoi ai ka waa o ko’u haku?”","While Kaneapua was one day seated by the seashore on the Kaunolu point, he saw the double canoe of Wahanui passing by, so he called out from the shore: “Whose canoe is that?” “It is Wahanui’s,” replied the prophet Kilohi. “Wahanui is the chief, who is the prophet?” “Kilohi.” Kaneapua again asked: “A canoe, sailing where to?” “It is a canoe sailing to Tahiti to step on the breasts of Kane and Kanaloa.” Kaneapua called out: “Why not let me come too?” Kilohi answered: “The canoe is already loaded down.” “If the canoe is loaded down, let me ride on the sticks connecting the canoe to the outrigger.” “They are also overcrowded.” “Let me ride on the outrigger then.” “That too is overcrowded.” This conversation was carried on until every part of the canoe was requested for. Kaneapua then called after he had been denied a seat on any part of the canoe: “Return, it is going to be stormy.” Kilohi replied: “Who are you that shall cause my lord’s canoe to return?”"
"Holo mai la lakou mai Kaunolu a ka lae o Kaena, loaa i ka makani, ka ino, kahuli na waa, opili ke ’lii o Wahanui, pulu na ukana, hoi aku la a pae ma Lele, i Lahaina.

Wahanui the chief got a severe cold and the things in the canoe were wet: so they returned and landed at Lele, in Lahaina. After spending the night at this place they again set out the next day. Upon passing by Kaunolu, Kaneapua again called out as before, and again the prophet, Kilohi, refused to allow him to come aboard. Not very far from this place they again were caught in another [ ] storm and were forced to return a second time. On this return Wahanui began to realize how true the boy Kaneapua predicted and that he was much smarter than his prophet, Kilohi. On the next trip Kaneapua was given passage and the journey was then resumed. There were two sailing masters aboard, Hookele i Hilo and Hookele i Kau. Kaneapua sat behind the sailing masters. As soon as Kaneapua took his seat a thick fog was seen to approach them and before very long a thick darkness enveloped them; so thick indeed that those in the aft part of the canoe could not see those in the fore part. This darkness prevailed until they arrived at the land of Kanehunamoku, a land which appeared to them in the form of a dog. Kilohi said to Wahanui that it was a dog and begged him that they return to Hawaii and kiss the children and wives ere they be eaten up by the man-eating dog of Hina. At this it was made evident to Wahanui, that Kilohi was not the great priest that he had all along thought him to be, and that they would all have been killed if Kaneapua had not been allowed to join them."
"Olelo Hoakaka. Ua maopopo, aohe ike o Kilohi ma keia olelo ana; mai make lakou, ina aole o Kaneapua e kau pu me lakou.

Upon seeing you to be a stranger the land is hidden from view, when it becomes clear [it will be seen]. There are people on the land as you can hear their voices.” When they drew nearer to the place they saw that it was land, they also saw a man who was gathering coral for food, a death-dealing food. Soon after this they left the land of Kanehunamoku and continued on their way. After they had sailed for some time they looked up and saw two hills, Paliuli and Palikea which appeared to be moving and towering above and ahead of them. These two hills were two demi-gods sent by Kane and Kanaloa who desired their destruction. Kaneapua said to Wahanui and Kilohi: “That is death, if those hills should crumble and fall on us we shall all be killed. They have been sent by Kane and Kanaloa.” Kaneapua then called out to Paliuli and Palikea: “Return down below else I shall be killed and you two will be ashamed.” At this call the two hills were shamed and the travelers were saved. Kaneapua then said to Wahanui: “You float here while I dive down below. Honunuikuaeaea my grandmother is down there; if her back is turned up it will mean our death, but if it is turned down, we will be saved.” He then dove down and called out: “Honunuikuaeaea, turn your face upward.” She then turned her face upward and called out: “Whose offspring art thou?” “Yours.” “What is your name?” “Kaneapua.” The grandmother then fell on him and wept, and then asked him: “What is the object of this journey that brings my lord here?” “I want a rope to moor the canoe with.” She then gave Kaneapua her intestines and Kaneapua rose to the surface and tied the rope to the canoe."

The wind came up, a storm arose, the sea became rough, the waves beat down and broke over them causing the coral to be thrown up on the shore. This storm lasted ten days. When the storm abated the travelers once more thought of safety and that all their troubles were about over; but there yet remained one more object to be encountered, a dog that belonged to Kaneapua. They then landed and [ ] moored their canoe. Kaneapua then said to Wahanui: “Go until you find three men who are lying down face up; they are Kane and Kanaloa, and the third one is Mauli. Step on the breasts of all three of them and return, but don’t look backward.” Wahanui then went on his way and after carrying out the instructions he returned. Kaneapua then instructed his companions, saying: “You must now wrap me up and make me appear to be striped and say that I am your god, Kaneapua.” When Wahanui heard this he went down on his knees before Kaneapua and offered him all the things of value brought by him; this being the first time that he was made aware that this person who had been with them all this time was Kaneapua. Shortly after this all manner of spirits gathered and asked: “Where is your god?” “Here it is standing.” “Yes, you have a large god indeed.” “Yes, you could all be devoured [by him] without satisfying his hunger.”"
"Olelo aku la o Kaneapua: “Ea, i komo oukou i ka hale, mai noho oukou ma kahi maikai, he make ia, ma kahi inoino he ola ia.” Hiki aku la lakou i ka hale.

They lived here until after the expiration of some months when they made their preparation to return home. On leaving, Kaneapua gave Wahanui an image of a double-bodied giant, the bodies being joined together by means of the ribs growing into one another. It had two heads, four hands and feet and four eyes. If one was called to obey the laws of nature, the other accompanied without such desire, and so in all their movements. Upon accepting this present Kaneapua said to him: “Don’t show this image until you reach Hawaii for otherwise you will get killed.”"

[ ]","On the return voyage Wahanui first landed at Kauai, where they met a great crowd of people together with the king Kupakoili and his prophet Luluupali. Because of the shouts made by the people ashore Wahanui went ashore with his present. When the people saw this strange object they gave a mighty shout. When Kupakoili heard the shout, he inquired of his prophet, Luluupali: “How can I get possession of that image?” Luluupali answered: “Kill the king and his people and burn up the canoes.” This advice was carried out by Kupakoili, and Wahanui was killed and his image taken away. One man, however, escaped; he was one of the bailers; he dove into the sea and escaped. After a time he took unto himself a wife, a Kauai woman and settled there, taking up fishing as his occupation. It was this man’s usual custom while on his fishing trips to carry a large quantity of food along with him . After he had done this for some time his wife began to be inquisitive and at last asked him why he took so much food; he answered: “What fault is there in taking this food? Food is easily brought back again.” Shortly after this while out fishing, a storm came up and he was blown out to sea, and after a number of days he managed to land on Hawaii. When he met the people he told them that Wahanui and his followers had all been killed in Kauai, and that he was the only one who escaped. A proclamation was then issued calling the people of Hawaii to come together and to make preparations for avenging the death of [ ] their king. A double canoe was then sent to Kauai to invite Kupakoili and his people to come to Hawaii and get all the canoes and all the property on that island. The invitation was as follows: “Let no man, woman, or child remain, all must sail for Hawaii.” This invitation was accepted and all the people sailed for Hawaii where they were all killed; no one escaped.

Kaeha was the first-born, Kamano was the second, and Kaulu was the youngest of the three. Kailua in Koolau [was] their birthplace. Kaeha the oldest brother loved and esteemed Kaulu; while Kamano hated and ill-treated Kaulu the youngest of their family. Kaulu was in his mother’s womb five years before he was born; at birth he already had a full set of teeth; his hair was long, and his buttocks covered with hair."
"O ko laua kaikuaana o Kaeha, ia ia i lohe ai i ka make o Kaulu ke hanau ae, olelo aku ia ia Kamano: “Heaha ka mea e make ai ko kaua pokii?” A lohe o Kaulu i keia olelo a Kaeha, olelo iho ia i loko o ka opu: “Aia ua ola, o oe ka ko’u mea e ola ai; heaha la hoi, i ola au ia oe, alaila, malama aku au ia oe.” Hanau o Kaulu, he pauku kaula aohe kino maoli; nana ke kaikuaana huhu o Kamano, aohe kino, olelo iho ia, ina he kino kou make oe ia’u.

On hearing this Kaulu stayed in the womb. When Kaeha the oldest brother heard that the next child was to be killed, he asked Kamano: “Why should you kill the next child?” When Kaulu heard Kaeha say this he said to himself while still in the womb: “There, I see I will live. You will save me. Well and good, if you save me then I will take care of you.” When Kaulu was born he was in the form of a piece of rope, having no human form. When Kamano, the angry brother saw that it had no human form, he said: “If you had a human body I would kill you.” Kaeha on the other hand took up the piece of rope, Kaulu, and put him up on a shelf, where he remained until all of thirty days had gone by without being once looked at. Kaeha in the meantime had been carried off by the spirits and was left in a certain place in the sky, or heaven, called Lewanuu and Lewalani where Kane and Kanaloa had their home."

This shelf was used for the purpose of stowing away kapas. When he awoke he looked around the inside of the house and saw that his oldest brother Kaeha was missing. He then proceeded out of the house and looking up he saw that his brother had been carried up by the spirits to the Lewanuu and Lewalani . At this he started off in search of his brother Kaeha. Upon coming to where the heavy surf was beating he inquired of the surf: “I say, this high surf are you strong?” The surf replied: “Yes.” Kaulu asked: “What is your strength?” “I strike from above and when I catch them I give them a good soaking,” said the surf. Eight surfs then struck Kaulu, but he was not injured. Kaulu then asked of his hands: “Say, Hakaukahi my right hand and Limapaihala my left hand.” “What is it?” asked the two hands. “Flamed is the upper jaw, flamed is the lower jaw.” Kaulu then reached for the surf and broke it into small pieces, thus making the surf small unto this day. He then continued on his way until he met other [ ] demigods, the small and large waves to whom he said: “You are only making the ocean look white, you have no strength.” The waves replied: “We are strong and also brave.” A fight was then had in which he killed both of his opponents; therefore the waves are small to this day. After this he continued on his way until he met Kuililoloa, a dog that was guarding the land and the sea. Another battle was fought in which Kuililoloa was torn to pieces, therefore the dogs are small to this day."

At dusk that evening the spirits asked Kaeha: “Let us prepare some awa.” They then all got some awa and prepared the awa to be pounded. After pounding a sufficient quantity, Kaeha went out to cool himself. Upon seeing Kaeha Kaulu came out of his hiding place and met his brother. At seeing this small fellow Kaeha asked: “Who is this small boy?” “I am Kaulu, your youngest brother, whom you placed on the shelf. Because I love you I came to look for you.” Kaeha then said: “We are going to drink awa with the spirits.” Kaulu said: “Yes, tell the spirits to drink their awa first and you take yours after them. Before you drink yours offer a little to me as your god by repeating the following words: “Here is our awa.” I will then answer back: “Drink it and let me have the portion that is intoxicating.” At the close of the conference held by the two Kaulu returned to the palm leaf, while Kaeha returned to the house to join the spirits. Upon entering the house the spirits said to Kaeha: “Drink your awa first.” Kaeha replied: “No.” The spirits then drank theirs up. After the spirits had finished, Kaeha said to the spirits: “Now you be quiet until after I have taken my awa.” Kaeha then took up his cup of awa and offered up a prayer:"

Upon the arrival of Kolea and his mate in the presence of Makalii, Makalii asked them: “What do you two want?” “We have been sent by Kane and Kanaloa to ask you about the loud-voiced god that calls out at night.” Makalii replied: “That is Kaulu the youngest brother of Kaeha. He is all-powerful and strong and he is hiding in the palm leaf.”"

[ ]","Upon the return of Kolea and his mate in the presence of Kane and Kanaloa, they repeated what they had been told by Makalii. On hearing the report, the spirits went out and searched for Kaulu in the palm leaf, but could not find him. After this it became a general thing for the spirit to get intoxicated on awa. One night Kaulu brought in some large stones and placed them on the place where the spirits slept at night. In the middle of the night the spirits woke up and bumped their heads against them. The gods called to one another regarding these stones."

When Kaulu saw Kaeha going from place to place he knew what he wanted so he took Kaeha with him and flew to Manowaikeoo, a land owned by Kane and Kanaloa, where all the food belonging to the spirits was raised. The place was guarded by four men, Uweliki, Uweleka, Maalaka and Maalaki. These men watched in pairs. In the watch of Maalaka and Maalaki Kaulu and Kaeha were seen so they turned the face of the land downward causing a deep depression in the land whereby Kaulu and Kaeha fell off the land into space. When Kaulu saw that they were in trouble he called out:"
"E Kaulu-e, awa ia, E Kaulu-e, kikoo-lia. E Kaulu-e, pupuu-lia. Eha kaukahi, eha kaulua.","Say, Kaulu, turn down; Say, Kaulu, stretch out; Say, Kaulu, double up. [There are] four single ones [And] four double ones."

As soon as this was done Kaulu propped it open while he called for his brother to come out. Kaeha then came out. His hair had all fallen off making him bald headed. Kukamaulunuiakea was thereupon slain by Kaulu and its spirit flew up to heaven and it turned into the Milky Way as seen at midnight, from ancient time to the present day. Kaulu and Kaeha then returned and Kaulu vomited out the sea water. Kaeha was in front and Kaulu in the rear, as the ocean was restored. It is said that owing to this action of Kaulu the sea water became salty to this day."

So the spirits and Kaeha proceeded to where a swing was rigged up, when they remarked to Kaeha: “You take the first ride while we push the swing for you.” While this conversation was going on, Kaulu arrived and in a cunning way said: “Say, if you all wish to take a ride on the swing, I will pull the [ ] rope.” He then proceeded to instruct them how to ride the swing. “In my country we ride the swing by sitting facing one another to the full length or top of the rope; then the swing is pulled and the pleasure begins.” In this way all those spirits were killed, by the swing breaking. When the remaining spirits saw this trick played on them by Kaulu, they thought they would get even with him by again enticing Kaeha to go with them for rod-fishing. On this fishing excursion Kaeha was killed and he was put in the shell of a bitter opihi, the kind that sticks to the smooth boulders. On missing Kaeha, Kaulu went in search of him until he discovered him in an opihi; but on account of its smooth surface he was unable to get the opihi from the boulder, so he urinated on the opihi, which released Kaeha. This action caused all the opihi of this kind to become bitter to this day, and it has always been known from that day as the bitter opihi. After Kaeha was brought to life again by Kaulu they returned to live on Oahu. When they arrived at Papakolea, Moanalua, Kaulu left Kaeha at this place while he continued on his way to Kapalama in search of Haumea. Haumea was a spirit that lived at Niuhelewai, Oahu. It was a female spirit. Upon the arrival of Kaulu he found Haumea asleep. Kaulu then called: “Say, Haumea, why don’t you get up, cook your food and afterwards fight with Kaulu?” Haumea then sat up while Kaulu returned home and then flew up to Makalii who asked him: “What is it you want, Kaulu?” “I have come for the net. Give it to me so that I will be able to kill Haumea.” Makalii then gave him his nets, Maoleha and its mate. Kaulu then returned and again found Haumea asleep. Kaulu then surrounded the house with the nets, after which he called out to Haumea: “Are you to continue on sleeping? Why don’t you get up and let us fight?” Haumea then woke up and tried this way and that to get out of the house. Kaulu kept at some distance away from the house and ran around it. At seeing Kaulu running around, Haumea attempted to get after him and was entangled in the net where she was caught and killed. Kaulu then went for Kaeha and they returned to Kailua [Oahu] their birthplace where their parents were then living."
"O Lonokaeho ke ’lii o Koolau a me Kailua, nona ka lae oi o Piokeanuenue.

He had a very prominent forehead and was called Piokeanuenue. Soon after the return of Kaulu to Kailua he went to the king’s house and asked the king’s attendants: “Who is that man with the sharp forehead?” “Lonokaeho,” replied one of the attendants. They then called for Lonokaeho, saying: “Here is a youngster who is calling you names.” “What did he say?” “Who is that man with the sharp forehead?” Lonokaeho then said: “Are you strong, coming to Lonokaeho’s place in this way?” Kaulu replied: “I have a little strength but not much.” Lonokaeho’s forehead then ascended to heaven and came down again, with the idea of striking Kaulu and killing him; but Kaulu said:"
"E Kaulu e, awaa ia. E Kaulu-e, kikoo-lia. E Kaulu e, pupuu lia. Eha kaukahi, Eha kaulua. [ ]","Say, Kaulu, turn down. Say, Kaulu, stretch out. Say, Kaulu, double up. [There are] four single ones [And] four double ones. [ ]"
"Ninau ae na lima o Kaulu: “E aha la?” “O ke a luna i luna, o ke a lalo i lalo.” Paa ka lae o Lonokaeho i ka honua, ulu ka ohia, ka mauu i luna, a make iho la o Lonokaeho, ma kela puu kaulana o Olomana, e ku nei a hiki i keia la.","Kaulu’s hands then asked: “What is it?” Kaulu replied: “The upper jaw, hold it up; the lower jaw, hold it down.” Lonokaeho’s forehead was thus made fast to the ground; the ohia trees and the grass grew over him and Lonokaeho was killed on that famous hill of Olomana, which stands to this day."
"Noho iho la o Kaulu me Kaeha, a mahope make iho la o Kaeha, noho iho la o Kaulu a hoao me kana wahine, o Kekele ka inoa.

Kekele was a very handsome woman whose breath and skin were as sweet as the inamona. She was a very quiet woman. Her favorite flowers and vines were the hala, maile, ieie and all the fragrant leaves. When she retired at night she used to sleep with her hala wreaths and would wear them until they were dried up; therefore the hala at Kekele was planted for her and it grows to this day. They lived as husband and wife until their death without having any children. [ ]"

Her skin was like the covering of the young banana shoot; her eyes were like the weleweka blossom and her form was erect and faultless. Hooleipalaoa was the father, and Pili was the mother, and the land of [Hoamakeikekula’s] birth was Oioiapaiho in Kohala. Hooleipalaoa and Pili were of very high chief rank of Kohala in ancient time. Pili conceived and gave birth to a son Waikuaala by name. After he was grown up Pili again conceived and gave birth to the faultless one, Hoamakeikekula. Hoamakeikekula upon her birth was in the form of an ala (taro), and not having human form was thrown aside with a lot of sugar-cane trash by Pili the mother."

Kahea ana:","Makapailu, the mother of Pili who was a great fortune-teller, in a vision saw the spirit of Hoamakeikekula standing before her; and on being asked: “What does this beautiful young woman, whom I have not seen before, want?” Hoamakeikekula answered: “I am your granddaughter who has been thrown away by your daughter Pili. I am the younger child, next to Waikuaala, therefore I want you to come for me. I am in a pile of sugar-cane trash in the form of a taro bulb. Make haste or I shall be devoured by dogs.” When Makapailu heard this call from her grandchild, she rose and started on her journey, weeping. When Makapailu arrived at the pile of sugar-cane trash, she looked it over and lo she beheld a small rainbow in a thick fog, which moved toward her until it stood in her very presence. As she kept gazing thereon, her eyes grew dim and after a while she closed them. When she looked again she saw a taro bulb; she took it up and wrapped it in a red kapa and returned home. Upon arriving at her home, she told her husband, Hawaimake by name of what she [ ] had done. At the end of twenty days the outside covering of the package was removed and Makapailu looked and saw that the taro had changed and was in the form of a very beautiful female child, one without a blemish and very pleasant to look upon. The grandparents from this time on brought her up with great surveillance under very strict kapu. This was maintained until she was twenty years of age, without the knowledge of anybody, even her own parents. After she grew up it was her usual custom to go with her attendant in the woods to string lehua blossoms into leis, without the knowledge of any one. On their fourth day out in the woods to string wreaths of lehua, they reached a section in the thick woods, a place to them unknown where the lehua was plentiful. While they were picking the lehua there came Elepaio, the messenger of Kalamaula, the lizard king of Keawewai. Elepaio was a bird that changed at times into a human form. It called out:"
"I Waiaha ka wi, i Waiaha ka wi. Ono ka ia, ono ka ia.","The wi is at Waiaha, the wi is at Waiaha. The fish is good, the fish is good."
"I aku o Hoamakeikekula: “E, he manu hoi keia e hea nei.” I mai ke kahu: “He wi laau paha, he makani paha, e hoolohe kaua.” E kani hou ana ua wahi manu nei:","Hoamakeikekula said to her companion: “Say, there is a bird calling.” The attendant answered: “Perhaps it is the squeak of a tree rubbing one against another, or it may be the wind. Let us listen.” The bird again sang out:"
"I aku o Hoamakeikekula: “Aia hoi paha la, he manu.” Huli aku la laua e nana pono, ia laua i hoomau aku ai i ka nana, loli ae la ke ano o ka manu a lilo i kanaka.

While they continued watching the bird, it changed its form and assumed that of a human being. There stood a young man of handsome appearance who said: “My greetings to you two.” But when he saw the beauty of Hoamakeikekula he chanted and interpreted the following mele:"
"O Haili kula lehua, I wili ia e ka manu, O ka oo kani leo lea, I ka nahele o Hilo, O ka pololei kani kuamauna Ke lawe la ke awa, Kau laau o Puna.","Haili, the plain of lehua [flowers] Where the birds twine them into wreaths. The oo with its sweet note In the leafy dell of Hilo; Like the voice of the Achatinella Gathering the awa That grows on the trees in the forests of Puna."
"Ia wa, olelo aku ke kahu ia Hoamakeikekula: “E hoi kaua, ua pau ka wa kui lehua. E inoino mai auanei ka mano ou kupuna ia kaua i ka loihi loa.” Ia laua i eu mai ai e hoi, e olelo ae ana o Elepaio i ka ohu:","Upon hearing this the attendant said to Hoamakeikekula: “Let us return home; the time for stringing wreaths is ended. Your grandparents will be worried if we remain much longer. ” As they were about to return, Elepaio spoke to the fog:"
"E ka ohu kolo mai i uka E ka ohu kolo mai i kai, E kai pupuka, E kai hehena, E kai piliaiku. [ ]","Ye fog that creeps in the upland, Ye fog that creeps seaward; Ye ugly seas, ye mad seas, Ye kapu-breaking seas. [ ]"
"Ia manawa uhi ka ohu, paa ka nahele, kaawale ke kahu o Hoamakeikekula, kaawale kona haku kina ole.

In this separation Hoamakeikekula was enveloped in the thick fog and mist until she arrived at Keawewai, a place in the uplands of Kawaihae. The way was indicated by a colored cloud. At this time Kalamaula the high chief was living with his parents. Kaholeiwai was the father, Kekoolauwahineolalo was the mother and Kanaheleikaukawaokele was the sister. They were chiefs of Kawaihae at this time. Kalamaula was a handsome youth but was not in the same rank with Hoamakeikekula."
"A hiki laua nei i ka hale, ua molehulehu ahiahi iho la, komo aku la i ka hale o Kalamaula e noho nei, nana mai la lakou i keia wahine ui, nani loa.

Noho iho la o Hoamakeikekula me ka ai ole i ka ai, me ka puka ole i waho.","Upon their arrival at the house, the sun had set and darkness was approaching. They then entered the house where Kalamaula was living. When Kalamaula saw this beautiful woman coming in he greeted her; and Hoamakeikekula returned the greeting in a very low voice saying: “My greeting to you my lord.” Soon after this Elepaio related the way he found Hoamakeikekula. Then Kalamaula seized hold of Hoamakeikekula and drew her to him. Hoamakeikekula then said: “My lord don’t defile me, your maid servant, for it would be a wrong I would suffer from later in life. If you really desire that I become your wife, then allow me thirty days, possibly the response will arise within me during that time.” On hearing this reply Kalamaula was much impressed and agreed to the conditions. Hoamakeikekula remained there, but she would not touch the food placed before her, nor did she go out of the house."
"Ekolu la i hala ia ia, ike aku la ia ma ka moe uhane i keia kanaka e hele mai ana me ka newa, i ka lima akau, e paa ana olelo mai la: “Ua haawi mai ko kupunawahine ia oe na’u, a ua kakali au i loko o na la he nui lao, a ua maule wale iho kuu manao nou i ka hooko ole ia o ka haawi.

Aka, ua kau wale mai no ke ano o ka nahele ia ia.","At the end of three days, she saw in a dream a man approaching her with a war club in his right hand, who said: “Your grandmother promised me that you were to be mine and I have, therefore, waited many days for you until my spirit within me has fainted because that promise has not been fulfilled. Therefore, prepare yourself to go on a strange journey.” Hoamakeikekula replied: “I did not come here with the consent of my people, nor were my footsteps that led me here as a stranger bargained for, therefore, I shall take your words as a mantle and wear it over my shoulders at all times.”"
"Moe hou iho la ia, o ka lua ia o ka po, loaa hou ka moe, o ia mau olelo no nae. Ia wa puni ia i ke aloha i kela uhane; puoho ae la ia a uwe, puliki iho la i ke kino a paiauma.

She then tried to fathom the meaning of the dream but it was beyond her understanding. Her mind, however, seemed to dwell on the forests. On retiring the next night she again dreamed of the same person and held the same conversation. She then fell in love with the person in her dreams so much so that she woke up startled and cried. She then folded her arms, lamenting. When Kalamaula heard her weeping he asked her: “What are you weeping for? You have never done this before, not since the first day you arrived here.” Hoamakeikekula did not, however, make answer. Very early that morning just before dawn, the mountain clouds began to thicken; drops of rain began to fall one by one; the wind began to rise; the fog began to come creeping over the mamane; a rainbow appeared and stood before her. She was then entirely enveloped in a thick fog which hid everything from view."
"Lilo aku la keia i ke kula mehameha kanaka ole, a noho mauka o Pahulumoa, he aina mehameha kanaka ole; malaila ia i noho ai me ka ai ole i ka ai, o ka lehua [ ] kana mea walea o ka la e noho ai.

No loko o laila keia inoa o Hoamakeikekula, no kona noho mehameha ana.","She then rose and went out of the house and wandered over the deserted hills and plains until she arrived in the uplands of Pahulumoa, a place entirely uninhabited. She lived here without tasting food and spent her days picking and stringing lehua [ ] blossoms. At night she would retire and dream of the same person. Thus they were united in love, which became steadfast in Hoamakeikekula."
"A liuliu kona mau la ma ia wahi, loaa i kekahi kanaka huli laau hale, o Puuhue kona inoa. O kona kumu i ike ai, he ahi a i ke awakea i luna o ke kumu olapa.

After leading the life of a wanderer for some days, she was at last found by a man called Puuhue who was after some house timber. He found her in the following manner: On coming to an olapa tree he saw something bright at noon time, up in this tree. When he looked up the tree he saw a very beautiful woman hiding in the ieie vines; so he stood under the tree and called out: “Say, come down that I may fondle you and that I may speak to you.”"
"Iho iho la o Hoamakeikekula i lalo a hiki, lele aku la o Puuhue a ma ka poli wawae, honi iho la, a olelo aku la: “Pomaikai au i ko’u ike ana i kou mau maka a me kou helehelena.

When she stood on the ground, Puuhue sprang forward, lifted up and kissed the bottom of her feet and said: “I am indeed blessed in beholding your eyes and your face. I humbly beg of you that if in your goodness and beauty, I would be so fortunate as to please you my princess, that I offer you my noble lord, whose spirit you have often seen in your dreams.” This person was Puuonale, the king of Kohala, whose spirit Hoamakeikekula had so often seen in her dreams and for whom she already had a deep attachment. He was as handsome as she was beautiful, both were without blemish."
"A pau ka olelo a Puuhue, ua hoololi ia ka naau o Hoamakeikekula e ia olelo; nolaila, ua haalele ia ia Pahulumoa, a hoi pu mai la me Puuhue. A hiki laua ma Keolewa, e noho ana o Puuonale ke ’lii, a nana aku la keia, ua like me ke ano o ke kino uhane ana e ike ai ma ka moe, kulu iho la ka waimaka me ka haloiloi.","As soon as Puuhue ended, the heart of Hoamakeikekula was changed by his words, so that she left Pahulumoa and accompanied him. When they arrived at a place called Keolewa, they found Puuonale the king living there. When Hoamakeikekula looked on and saw the object of her dreams, she was unable to withhold her tears which flooded her eyes."
"Ninau mai o Puuonale: “E kuu haku, heaha ka mea i helelei iho ai kou waimaka i keia wa?” “He mea ano like me oe ka’u e uwe nei, ua launa me a’u i na la mamua aku nei, maloko o ke kino iwi ole. A no ia mea au i luuluu iho ai i ke kaumaha, a o kuu mea ia e hookaa nei i ka aie a ke aloha, he kulu waimaka.”",At seeing this Puuonale asked: “Why these tears from the eyes of my queen?” “I have seen some one like you in my dreams constantly during the past days in a form without bones for whom I am paying my debt of love with these tears; hence my sadness and tears.”
"Noonoo iho la o Puuonale a liuliu, pane aku la ia: “Pehea ke ano a me ka helehelena i kau ike.” “O kou ano a pau loa, oia kona, o kau mau olelo, oia kana, eia nae, he laau newa ma kona lima, a o ka aahu, he ahuula, a he mahiole ma kona poo.” Lalau aku la o Puuonale i ka newa, ka ahuula, ka mahiole, a waiho mai la imua o Hoamakeikekula, lalau iho la ia a honi iho la me na waimaka e hiolo ana mai na maka aku.","After pondering the matter over for a while, Puuonale asked: “Whom did he resemble?” “He looked just like you; your voice sounds just like his; he, however, carried a war club and wore a feather cape and a feather helmet.” Puuonale then took up his war club, the feather cape and helmet and placed them before Hoamakeikekula. She then took them up kissed them and wept over them."
"I kona naha ana, kui ka hekili pamaloo, lapalapa ka uwila, pio na anuenue ewalu, lana na kiowai o Kahoolana, i luna o Kahua, lalani ka ua koko ma ka moana, aaki ka ohu i na puu, uhi ka pohina hookahi anahulu, o ia na hoailona.",Puuonale then took Hoamakeikekula as his wife. At their union the thunder was heard; the lightning flashed; eight rainbows arched the heavens; the pools of Kahoolana on Kahua were flooded; red rain passed in procession on the ocean; the hills were covered with fog; and a thick mist covered the land for ten days. These were the signs [of recognition]. The two lived on happily as husband and wife.
"Noho iho la laua he kane a he wahine, a liuliu, hapai o Hoamakeikekula, a hana o Alelekinana, he kino kii, aohe keiki maoli, nolaila keia olelo: “I uka o Hookukekii, i [ ] kai o Kahua.” No keia keiki kii kela olelo, ua kaulana ia a hiki i keia la.

It did not have a human form but that of a wooden image; hence the saying: “In the upland is Hookukekii, in the lowland is Kahua.” [ ] The saying originated from this child image, and it is used to this day. This image gave the people of Kohala the idea of making idols, from which the worshiping of idols throughout Kohala in ancient time originated. The word Hoamakeikekula was also derived from the fact that Kohala is a rolling country and has plains, and because of this the people of Kohala have a fond attachment for the land of their birth. Therefore, Kohala is noted as the proud land with lonesome loving meadows. Such is the place of this legend obtained by me, which I have narrated. [ ]"

They had two children, Hookaakaaikapakaakaua a son, and Kapuaokaoheloai a daughter. Waiakea in Hilo is the country where these people lived. The brother was the first born and the sister the last. These people were of high chief rank of Hilo. These two children were brought up without knowing that they were brother and sister. They never saw each other although they lived in the same house. The brother had a male attendant and the sister a female attendant. They were brought up under a very strict kapu; they never went out of doors, not even for the calls of nature. Ku and Hina also left word with the attendants that if the brother sought the sister, then he and his attendant would be banished to Kuaihelani (a land in Tahiti), and so with the other. This manner of living was maintained for twenty years, without their seeing one another. One day the attendants as was their custom went to the uplands of Kaumana, directly above Punahoa to do farm work. After the departure of the attendants in the early morning, Kapuaokaoheloai arose and walked out of doors. Upon looking back at the house she saw a bright light within; so she again entered the house and began a search and found a door, which she opened. As she walked in she saw a red object lying on a bed. She removed the tapa from the face and saw a very handsome young man. They then slept together until the sun had passed the meridian, when she returned to her part of the house."

This conduct was kept up for ten full days. One evening Kapuaokaoheloai caught some chickens and brought them to her bed where they were concealed. That evening she and her attendant retired very early. Not very long after they had retired, Kapuaokaoheloai woke up and shook the chickens which caused the roosters to crow. She then said to her attendant: “It is daylight. It is now time for you two to go up and tend to our farm work.” The attendant replied: “How quickly daylight has come. It seems that I have just closed my eyes when I heard the cock crowing.” She woke up and went out of doors and looked up at the Milky Way which had not made its appearance: so she reentered the house and went to bed again. Kapuaokaoheloai after [ ] a while again reached for the chickens and shook them and the roosters again crowed. She woke her attendant and said: “It is daylight, the chickens are all crowing together.” Her attendant then rose and went over to the other part of the house where the male attendant was sleeping and woke him up. The two rose and started on their way to the farm lands. As soon as they left, Kapuaokaoheloai got up and went over to the other side of the house where her brother was and they slept together. When the two attendants were half way up to the farm lands, they sat down to await the approach of daylight. After waiting for some time and daylight not appearing they returned to the house and discovered their charges sleeping together. The male attendant then said to the female attendant: “I am going up to inform their parents in obedience to the instructions given us in the beginning.” The female attendant who was his wife replied: “Yes, you must go up.” When the male attendant arrived at the home of Ku and Hina, he told them of the conduct of their two charges. At this Ku gave orders to his men to go and kill the female attendant. When the men arrived they caught her to carry out the death order, but she spoke up: “Don’t kill me here, take me to the chief’s presence and there I will die. I want the chief to hear me first.” When they arrived in the presence of Ku and Hina, Ku asked the men: “Why did you save her? Why didn’t you kill her?” “She asked that after you have heard what she has to say then she will die.” Ku then asked: “What have you to say?” The attendant replied: “The chief said, that if my charge should make the first approach then I was to be banished with her to Kuaihelani. This was also your charge and command in reference to the other one of us and his charge. That is what I wish to say to the chief.” “Yes, you are right, you shall not die; you and your charge shall go to Kuaihelani.”"

[ ]","When she arrived in the presence of her charge, the double canoe was made ready and they sailed off; herself and her charge and two canoe paddlers making four of them. They sailed from Hawaii to Maui; from Maui to Oahu; from Oahu to Kauai and landed at Waimea. As they went ashore they saw a canoe on the beach from the king of Kuaihelani who was in search of a wife. When the two messengers saw Kapuaokaoheloai and her beauty, they said: “We are going to make an inspection of the whole group and if we fail to find a woman who will surpass your beauty, then we will take you as the wife for our king.” Kapuaokaoheloai and her companions, therefore, stayed at Waimea for over ten days, till the return of the messengers who reported that they had failed to find one equally as beautiful as Kapuaokaoheloai; so they embarked on their canoe and set sail for Kuaihelani. After they had been on their way for over forty days, the messengers of Kuaihelani said: “We will soon see land; we have yet, however, to smell the sweet perfume of the kiele.” After some days they caught the perfume of the kiele and soon after saw a beautiful country. The men then said to Kapuaokaoheloai: “When we reach land and arrive at the king’s house, and he should invite you to come up to him on the kapa cloth, don’t accept the invitation for it will mean death to you. If his daughter should invite you on the steps with her don’t go or it will be your death; only when they take you by the hand must you accept.” They then landed and proceeded to the place of the king. Upon seeing her the king greeted her, which greeting she returned. The king then invited her to come to him on to the kapa, this she refused. [ ]"

The name of his daughter was Kapuaokaohelo. The king desiring to know his daughter’s opinion sent word to her by a couple of birds with orders to come and look at this woman; and see if she intended making her a friend, or if she would advise him to take her as his wife."

The king’s daughter then came down and took her hand and led her up to the platform. When they were about half way up the steps, Kapuaokaoheloai slipped and fell behind; this was due to the dislike of the platform as she had lost her virginity. Her friend again reached out for her hand and led her to the top of the platform where they sat being ministered to by the birds."

When they reached the bathing pool, which was also a very sacred place, those having lost their virginity, or who were defiled, were not allowed to bathe in it, the friend said: “This my bathing pool is a very sacred place. The bathers must remove all covering before entering it.” Kapuaokaoheloai agreed to observe the rule, removed all her clothes and jumped into the water. Her friend then looked on admiringly seeing that she was indeed faultless; but detected the marks of a bite on one of her calves. The king’s daughter then climbed up the bank first when Kapuaokaoheloai followed after; but when she tried to climb the bank she slipped back , a sign that she had lost her virginity. At this her friend reached out her hand and helped her out of the water. When the king’s daughter saw the sign that her friend had lost her virginity she got angry and refused to speak to her, eat with her, or reside with her; she was so angry that she immediately sent some birds to go to her father and inform him of her discovery and to punish her with death."

If she is not of high rank then she must die.” The priests then gathered and inspected her and at the end they all agreed that her parents were not of high rank. They were of one mind with the king that she must indeed die, because she had climbed the sacred platform. There was, however, one amongst the priesthood who was not present at this time; so he was sent for by the king, to come and tell his knowledge concerning the stranger. When he arrived in the presence of the king, the king asked him: “Can you give a true interpretation concerning the rank of this woman? Whether she is of high rank or not?” The priest replied: “Yes.” The priest then continued: “She is of the highest rank and is a chiefess from the east; she is even more sacred than your daughter. The sacred platform is not for such as your daughter; it is the resting place of this one. She is far above your daughter in rank. She is none other, but is of your own blood; her mother, Hina, was the first-born and you came after. She [ ] originally belonged to Kuaihelani but moved to Hawaii where she now lives.” This saved Kapuaokaoheloai, and her friend once more joined her and lived with her as at first."

This was kept up for several nights in succession until ten full nights had passed when her friend became so much in love that she made up her mind to go in search of her lover. So one day she said to her friend: “Where abouts is your home?” “It is where the sun rises. If you should go, the first land you come to is Kauai, then Oahu, then Molokai, then Maui and then Hawaii. It is, however, at the first point where the sun comes up, called Kumukahi. The harbor Punahoa and Waianuenue is the first object to be seen upon landing. The large house which you will see in the upland is our home; my brother is still there with his attendant.” Soon after these instructions were given, her friend left Kuaihelani and set sail in her canoes until she arrived at Hilo and landed at Punahoa, where she saw a house standing in the uplands. When she arrived at the house she saw an old man sitting just within the door and a sick boy lying down. At seeing this she was puzzled, so inquired: “Is there no one else beside you two in this house?” “No, only us two.” She then returned to the beach leaving the two persons in the house."
"O keia keiki mai, o Hookaakaaikapakaakaua, ua hookii i ka ai, mai ka hele ana o ke kaikuahine a hiki i keia la; nolaila ua inoino ke kino, a wiwi loa, a ua haalele mai ka maikai i ke kino.","The sick boy was Hookaakaaikapakaakaua; he had refused to eat, from the day his sister departed from him even to this day. He therefore had grown ugly and very thin; and his once handsome face had lost its beauty."
"He mea mau i ua wahine nei, ka pii i na la ekolu e nana i keia hale, e makaikai, e ninau i ke kanaka; no keia hana, haohao ke kahu, a olelo aku i ka hanai. “E, nou paha keia wahine e makai mau nei i neia mau la ekolu, ua hoouna mai ko kaikuahine i wahine nau, e make auanei ko kaikuahine, ke hoi nele aku keia aohe kane.

As this happened for three days in succession, the old man began to grow anxious and asked his charge: “Say, I wonder if this woman is not yours who is inquiring after you these three days. I think your sister has sent her to you to be your wife. I am afraid your sister will get killed if this woman does not get the husband she is after. We must therefore coax your beauty back with food.” The attendant then proceeded and thatched a small hut and removed his charge to it; he then began to doctor him up, bathed him and fed him. At the end of two days and nights his beauty was restored and he again became as handsome as before."

[ ]","His intended wife at the end of the two days made her preparation to return to Kuaihelani; but before returning decided to make one more visit. When she was on her way up she saw a rainbow ahead of her and she also saw a thick rain cloud that was as red as blood. She then recalled the advice given her by her friend, that if she should see these things they would mean that her intended husband was there. When she arrived at the house she saw something red sleeping, so she asked the attendant: “What is that red object sleeping there?” “That is my charge who has just returned from a visit.” She then approached and uncovered him and laid down beside him. The man said: “We will not now lay together,” as his sister had forbidden it till she had lain with him. This occurring in a dream the ban was removed; in that way they came together. [ ]"

Ku was the king of Lihue at this time but had a different wife; Kaunoa also had a different husband. It was Ku’s custom to go traveling from place to place. One day while on one of his travels he saw Kaunoa bathing. At sight of her he halted on his way and looked at this beautiful woman. He was so overcome with her beauty that he approached her and asked her to be his wife while he remained in that neighborhood. To this Kaunoa assented. After they had lived together for a while, Ku believing that it was impossible for him to prolong his stay, told Kaunoa: “I am certain that you are with child. If you give birth to a boy call him Kalanimanuia, but if it should be a girl name her on your side. If, after you have brought up the child it wishes to come in search of me, here are my tokens: a loin cloth and a spear; with these things he may come until he find me.”"

She and her husband both brought up the boy until he was big and strong. Kalanimanuia was very handsome and pleasant to look upon. After he had grown into boyhood it was his custom to invite other boys to the house and give them all the food; when the father returned home and found the food all gone he would get angry and give Kalanimanuia a scolding. As Kalanimanuia continued to do this the father kept on scolding him and at times would whip the boy. One day while he was whipping the boy the mother, Kaunoa, upon hearing the boy crying, said: “Why do you whip the boy so constantly? He is not your son, he is somebody else’s son.” Upon hearing this Kalanimanuia asked his mother: “Who is my father then?” The mother denied this and said: “You have no other father, this is your own father.” The boy, however, was not satisfied with his mother’s answer and kept on asking her. This was kept up for over ten days, when Kaunoa finally said: “Yes, here are your father’s tokens, go in search of him.” She then gave him the loin cloth and the spear. Kalanimanuia then set out in search of Ku. Upon his arrival in the presence of Ku, Ku ordered his servants to seize the boy, take him to the sea and kill him; for Ku did not recognize the lad. Kalanimanuia was therefore killed and his body thrown into the sea. The exact place where Kalanimanuia was thrown was at the Kualoa point, in Koolau, Oahu. He was killed at this place."
"I ke ahiahi poeleele, lele mai la ka uhane a luna o ke ahua, olelo mai la:",Late that evening just about dusk the spirit of the boy flew up out of the water and rested on the rise above the point and called out:
"E Ku e, makua kina ino, I kau kama, Aohe nana iho o kona malo hume, Aohe kilohi iho o kana ihe, Anuanu koekoe Ka hale a ka makua e. E Kaunoa e. E Kaunoa e.

When they saw the spirit come into the temple every evening, with the voice of the child calling, they said to one another: “That must be the boy the king threw into the sea.” The old men after a time became deeply attached to the spirit of the boy; so they kept it and being priests they worshipped it. This was maintained for some days until the spirit assumed a real human form and was able to ask for its clothing and for food; so they gave him all the things they had in their possession."

Ku then began to think and after a while told the old men: “Yes, it is true that I had a son.” The old men then asked Ku: “Did you not take one to wife and when you parted from her, left with her certain things?” “Yes, I did take one Kaunoa to wife and I left with her certain things; a loin cloth and a spear.” “Then the boy you killed must have been your own son.” “Yes,” said Ku, “it must have been my own son.” Ku then inquired of the old men: “How am I to get my son?” The old men said: “Get a net, surround the house with three thicknesses and on the outside of that place a very fine net.” Late that evening the spirit of the boy returned to the temple as usual and fell asleep. While the spirit of the boy was sleeping the house was surrounded by three thicknesses of net. On the approach of day the spirit woke up and started to return to the sea. As it came out it saw that the house was surrounded by nets. The spirit then began to tear the nets. Daylight, however, found him entangled within the fine net. When the spirit was finally caught it had the form of a rat. It was then worked over until it almost assumed its human form again. A few days after this the daughter of Ku, Ihiawaawa by name, came to call on the boy, her half-brother."

After Kalanimanuia had again come back to life he asked her one day: “Which sweetheart is it that you go surf-riding with all day?” “It is Hala.” “Yes, Hala is a good enough fellow, but he has pimples on his back which make him ugly.” Ihiawaawa replied: “You are the handsome fellow having short thin hair. Kumunuiaiake is another sweetheart of mine.” “Yes, he is passable, but the fault with him is, he has only two hairs; pull them out and he will have none left which will make him look very ugly indeed.” “Aholenuimakaukai is another sweetheart of mine.” “Yes, he will appear to be very nice in the morning and in the evening he does nothing but catch flies. He is not a fit husband for you; he is ugly. Your beauty would indeed be thrown away on those ugly fellows.”"
"O keia mau olelo a pau loa a Kalanimanuia, ua olelo ia aku la ia mau kane nei ekolu, a ua lohe; nolaila, kukala lakou, e hoike i waho na maikai o lakou me Kalanimanuia.

The three then arrayed themselves in their best kapas scented with all the fragrant things and went forth to be viewed by the public. When the people saw them they gave a mighty shout."

[ ]","At daylight of the day when the public exhibition of all the sweethearts of his sister was to take place, Kalanimanuia came out on the palm of his attendant’s hand; the woods rejoiced, the winds, the earth, the rocks; rainbows appeared; colored rain-clouds moved, dry thunder pealed, lightnings flashed. When he reached the assembly where the chiefs and the people were gathered the three young men ran off ashamed. The sign of being the most handsome fellow was a suspended cord: if the cord fell to the ground of its own accord, then it was a sign that the person was the most handsome man. When Kalanimanuia approached the suspended cord, called Ahaula, it fell down without being touched. The other three were never able to do this. At this his father recognized him and everybody was permitted to come and see him. He was then made the king of Waianae. [ ]"

After they had lived together as husband and wife for some time, Hoeu left her and took unto himself another wife. Because of this, Kawaunuiaola became so overcome with sorrow, being greatly attached to Hoeu her husband, that she decided to resort to strategy in order to make him come back to her. After her husband had deserted her, she lived at their home all by herself. She then placed a kapu around her home, allowing no one to come to it and keeping herself entirely within doors: she thus lived in lonely seclusion."
"A hiki i kona wa ai, kaumaha ae la ia ia Hoeu kana kane i akua nona:","At meal time she petitioned Hoeu her husband, as her god, in the following words:"
"Eia ka ai e Hoeu, Eia ka ia, Eia ka wai, Amama ua noa,","Here is the food Hoeu, Here is the fish, Here is the water, Accept them all, they are free from restrictions."

"Ma keia olelo a Kawaunuiaola, oia wale iho no, kuhi na mea a pau loa he kane ka Kawaunuiaola, i ke kamailio mehe mea ala elua ka walaau.","In this conversation, she asked and answered the questions herself. People passing by who heard it were made to believe that Kawaunuiaola had a new husband. She also often used the following prayer:"

May the love that is beating within me fall. Say, Muki! Here is the food. The food is for Muki, The god that flies at night. Fall toward the upland, Fall toward the sea, Fall toward the froth of the ocean, Fill it to satisfy the craving within, Calling from the network within. Bind it fast The hair of the god, Not the binding that is loose and open But the binding that is tight and in a knot For the great knot that is within me is love. Paddle away! Paddle away! Like the paddling of the fishermen in the ocean, The husbandman cultivates in the field, Like the paddling of the god along the way. Oh, what must it be? Along the path trodden by you two From Kula to Hamakua. Like the game of hide and seek is the rain of Hamakua, The rain where one hides in the ti-leaf, Hide thou the object of my love there."

When those who heard her went on their way, they told others that Kawaunuiaola must have obtained a new husband. This was carried to Hoeu her husband one day in the following way: “Say, Hoeu, your wife, Kawaunuiaola acts in a very strange way; she must have obtained a new husband, for we have heard two voices talking; one in the voice of a female and the other in the voice of a man. It must be a new husband.” When Hoeu heard this from the people, he stood up and deserted the woman he was living with, the woman who enticed him away from Kawaunuiaola and he returned to his wife, at Kula. Upon his arrival at their home he asked his wife as to the rumors he had heard, which the wife denied, saying: “I have no husband, I am all alone.” They again made up and lived on as husband and wife. She was indeed cunning. [ ]"

They lived in Niolopa, Nuuanu. Kuula and his wife were great fisher folks, and they had in their possession a pearl fish-hook of great value called Kahuoi. This pearl fish-hook was in the keeping of a bird called Kamanuwai and it was kept at Kaumakapili. This pearl fish-hook was so enticing that every time Kuula went out for aku, outside of Mamala, upon seeing the hook they would jump into the canoes of their own accord. This fish was the food which this bird lived on. [ ]"
"I kekahi holo ana a Kuula i ka hi aku, i waho o Mamala, holo aku o Kipapalaulu, ke ’lii o Honolulu i ka lawaia, ike oia i ka pii o ke aku i na waa o Kuula, lawe aihue oia i ka pa, ia Kahuoi, lilo iaia, nele o Kuula i ka pa, a pololi no hoi ka manu i ka ai ole.

Upon seeing this he made up his mind to steal this fish-hook, Kahuoi, which in due time was carried out. This act not only deprived Kuula of his favorite hook, but the bird also hungered from loss of its food. Through this seizure of the pearl hook by Kipapalaulu the bird went without any food, it would fly on its roosting place and go to sleep. It was because the bird, Kamanuwai, closed its eyes from hunger was the reason why the place where it lived was called Kaumakapili, and the place is so called to this day."

At the birth of the child the parents threw it into the stream just below Kaumakapili. The water carried the child to a rock called Nahakaipuami, just below the Haaliliamanu bridge, where it is seen to this day (of writing), where it floated. Kipapalaulu was at this time living at Kapuukolo, where his palace was situated, with his daughter, Kauaelemimo by name. One day at noon she went in bathing with her maids and discovered Aiai by a large rock. Kauaelemimo took the child as her own and brought it up."
"A nui o Aiai, he keiki maikai loa ke nana aku, lawe ae la no o Kauaelemimo i kane nana, a moe iho la.

After a while she conceived a child and she began to have a longing for some fish; so Aiai went out rod fishing along the coast and after catching a few took the fish home and gave them to his wife. After the lapse of some twenty or thirty days, Kauaelemimo had a longing for aku; so she told Aiai to go out aku fishing. Aiai upon hearing his wife’s request asked her to go to her father, Kipapalaulu and ask him for a pearl fish-hook. The wife consented to this and went to her father. Upon coming in her father’s presence, he asked her: “What is it you want?” “I have come for a pearl fish-hook for my husband.” “Yes, here is a pearl fish-hook.” Kauaelemimo took it and returned to her husband. When Aiai saw the fish-hook, he said: “This pearl fish-hook is worthless, the fish will not bite it; it will weary one’s body for nothing.” The wife then asked him: “Where can I get another pearl fish-hook then?” Aiai replied: “You go to your father and tell him there is a pearl fish-hook that will enrich the fishermen. It is in the fishermen’s calabash of fishing utensils.” By this the husband wished to get possession of the pearl fish-hook Kahuoi which had been stolen from his father by Kipapalaulu."
"A hiki ke kaikamahine i mua o Kipapalaulu, nonoi aku i pa e haawi hou mai, hoole mai o Kipapalaulu: “Aohe pa i koe; o ka pau ae la no ia o na pa.” I aku o Kauaelemimo: “Ka!

[ ]","Upon coming to her father she asked for another pearl fish-hook. Kipapalaulu refused, saying: “There is none left to give; that was the last pearl fish-hook I had which I gave you.” Kauaelemimo said: “Aiai told me, you had another one; it is in the fishermen’s calabash of fishing utensils.” “Yes, certainly there is one. I now remember it for the first time.” The calabash was then brought to the king and when he looked in it he found the hook which he gave to his daughter. The wife then returned with it to her husband. Aiai took it and said: “My days of poverty are now [ ] over since you have come back.” Aiai then said to his wife: “Go back again to your father and ask him for a canoe; not one of five or eight fathoms in length, but get one that is ten fathoms in length; that is the size of the canoe that I want from your father.” When Kauaelemimo arrived in the presence of her father, she asked for the canoe described by her husband. When the canoe ten fathoms in length was brought the father asked the daughter: “Who will be able to paddle this canoe?” “My husband will.” When Aiai heard the answer made by his wife, he took the canoe and set out with the bird, Kamanuwai, taking the pearl fish-hook, Kahuoi, along. When he arrived off of Mamala he took out the hook and began fishing. The aku began to come and jump into the canoe of their own accord until it was loaded down deep. The bird then eat some of the fish and was again restored to its former self. When Aiai came home his double canoe was loaded down deep with aku. Upon arriving in the presence of his wife he gave her all the fish, but the pearl fish-hook was taken by the bird, Kamanuwai, its guardian. This is the legend of Aiai. [ ]"

After a while his master was kidnapped by Kanikaa, a spirit, so the dog went and lived with another master. It was the usual thing for the new master to go out fishing, so he took the dog with him, making it sit behind him in the canoe. Every time a fish was caught the dog would eat it up, and as the dog kept on doing this for some time, the master said: “Yes, I have no objections to your eating the fish, if you can only supply me with my favorite drink, the awa, then it would be all right for you to eat the fish.”"

In the evening the dog disappeared. This absence was because it went to steal awa down in the valley of Waipio. At this time Hakau the king was living at Waipio. He owned a large field of awa, just at the foot of the Puaahuku cliff. This was the field where Pupualenalena came and got awa. At daybreak he would reach home with his awa, when his master would take it, cut it up and prepare some and drink it. The master after this had all the awa he wanted and the dog kept him supplied for many days. The dog, however, went to the place so often that after a while very little of the field was left; so Hakau began to be suspicious and therefore set guards over the field. While the guards were watching one night, the dog came to the field and began pulling up the awa; when he had a sufficient amount for a load it took up the load and returned home. The guards then were sure that a dog was pulling the king’s awa, so they followed it. The dog being much faster than the guards it got away; but one fellow who was a good runner kept up the chase until Pupualenalena was finally tracked to Puako. When the guard saw the dog’s master he was covered with scales from the constant use of awa. The guard then approached him and asked: “Say, is this your dog?” The master replied: “Yes.” The guard then said: “You two have sinned [ ] against the king, Hakau. Your dog has been stealing the awa which belongs to the king.” The guard then took the man and his dog and brought them to Hakau in the valley of Waipio. When they arrived in the presence of Hakau, Hakau asked: “Is this your dog?” “Yes, it is mine,” answered the man. Hakau asked: “Have you been drinking my awa then?” “Yes, I have been drinking it. I thought that the awa came from some place nearer home. But I am mistaken, and that he has been getting it from Waipio, here.” Hakau replied: “Yes, I am going to kill both of you for taking my awa.”"

[ ]","During this time, in the reign of Hakau, there was a large shell used as a trumpet, called Kuana, that was owned by the spirits which lived above Waipio. This shell was blown every night and the sound from it made Hakau angry. So he said to the master of Pupualenalena: “I will, however, save you and your dog if you will get me the shell owned by the spirits.” While Hakau was speaking, Pupualenalena heard and understood the king’s wish. That night the shell was again blown by the spirits. At midnight the king of the spirits retired leaving the guards to keep watch; but later on they also fell asleep. Pupualenalena then stole in and jumped over the sleeping guards. Seeing the shell hanging over the king, it jumped over him, took the shell, stuck his head in through the loop of the string by which it was hung up and ran off with it. While in its flight and just as he was out of the house one side of the shell struck a rock and a piece of the shell was broken off. Upon hearing the crack of the shell the spirits woke up and gave chase, but they were unable to catch the dog. When the dog arrived in the presence of Hakau with the shell, he was so happy that he thereupon placed the master and his dog on a piece of land near by, and they became great favorites with Hakau.

The wise people are not all agreed as to the origin of these islands, and some have thought that they appeared or grew up from the sea. But according to the history of Hawaii, the ideas of the learned historians were entirely different from that theory. According to the traditions of Wakea and his wife Papa, these islands were the real children of this pair, being born of Papa and having Wakea for their father. Hawaii was the first child of Papa and Wakea, and some time afterwards Maui was born, and in this manner there were successive births of eleven islands. But Kahoolawe was not born of Papa and Wakea, but according to the tradition or legend of Haumea, Hina was the one who gave birth to this island and it was called Kahoolawe."

It is handed down in mele or poetic form:"

Then appeared the island, the land, The row of islands of Nuumea, The group of islands on the borders of Tahiti. Maui was born an island, a land, 2 A dwelling place for the children of Kamalalawalu. Kuluwaiea of Haumea as the husband, 3 Of Hinanuiakalana as the wife Was born Molokai, a god, a priest, The first morning light from Nuumea. Here stands the king, the heavenly one, 4 The life-giving water-drops, from Tahiti. Lanai was found, an adopted child. It was Keaukanai who had married, 5 Had married with Walinuu from Holani, [ ] The sacred albino of Uluhina. Kahoolawe was born, a foundling. Uluhina then was called upon, 6 The navel of the little one was cut, The afterbirth of the child that was thrown Into the folds of the rolling surf, The froth of the heaving sea, Then was found the loin cloth for the child. Molokini the island Is the navel string, the island is the navel string. Now stands forth Ahukinialaa, 7 A chief from the foreign land, From the gills of the fish, From the overwhelming billows of Halehalekalani. Then was born Oahu, a wohi, A wohi through Ahukinialaa . From Laakapu, who was the man, 8 From Laamealaakona a woman Who sickened of the child conception, Who sickened carrying the chief Nuupoki, At the sacred temple of Nonea During the lightning in the sacred night of Makalii. Then was born Kauai, a chief, a prince, a kingly scion Of the chiefly cluster belonging to Hawaii; Hawaii the foremost head of the islands That was spread out by Kalani. 9 The ships sailed freely to Holani, To the sacred precincts of freedom. Stand firm for the land of Kane Kanaloa, The barbed spear from Polapola, That pricked and uplifted Wanalia. Wanalia was the man 10 And Hanalaa was the woman, Of them was born Niihau, a land, an island, A land at the roots, the stem of the land. There were three children among them, Born in the same day, Niihau, Kaula, ending with Nihoa. The mother then conceived no more, No island appeared afterwards. It is Kalani who consecrates the islands, 11 Exalted in Nuumea Among the royal cluster of Kaialea. It is the conqueror who governs the islands. The thirds were joined together by Kalani; Hilo, and Puna, and Kau were thrown in. Kalani stands forth with the priest And inspected Maui of Kama. It was not long when he circuited the island Through the support given by Kalanimakahakona, The young brave that was foremost and highest, The great soldier of victories, The one who conquered Oahu, And the islands heard to their ends To the relief of Kauai through peace. All the islands were circled by Kalani, By Kalanialonoapii, From the royal stem of Haloa. Then Hawaii the island became prominent; Became prominent and victorious."

It is only the birth of the islands that is referred to and made plain by this history, tradition or recital of events, and it is well to look at the genealogy of the islands and see how they (the islands) became land according to the setting of historical events shown in the following chapter."

"“Ea mai Hawaiinuiakea, Ea mai loko mai o ka po. Puka ka moku, ka aina. Ka lalani aina o Nuumea; Ka pae aina i kukulu o Tahiti.”","“Now cometh forth Hawaiinuiakea, Appeareth out of darkness. An island, a land is born, The row of islands from Nuumea; The group of islands at the borders of Tahiti.”"

"“Hanau o Maui he moku, he aina, Na kama o Kamalalawalu e noho.”","“Maui was born an island, a land, A dwelling place for the children of Kamalalawalu.”"
"A o ka moolelo o ka loaa ana o Molokai i aina ai, ma ka nana iho i kona mau lalani mele e pili ana ia Molokai penei:",As for Molokai the birth of that island is referred to in the lines of the same song in this wise:
"“Na Kuluwaiea o Haumea he kane, Na Hinanuialana he wahine, Loaa Molokai he akua, he kahuna, He pualena no Nuumea.”","“It was Kuluwaiea of Haumea who was husband, It was Hinanuialana the wife, Then was born Molokai, a god, a priest, A yellow flower from Nuumea.”"
"Mehe mea la o Kuluwaiea he kane ia na Haumea nae, alaila moe aku, moe ia Hinanuialana, hanau o Molokai, he akua, a he kahuna.","It would seem that Kuluwaiea was a husband of Haumea, but went after Hinanuialana who conceived Molokai, a god and priest."

That is clearly shown in the mele of Kahakuikamoana in the fourth verse reading thus:"
"“Ku mai ke alii, ka lani, Ka haluku wai ea o Tahiti. Loaa o Lanai he keiki hookama.”","“Here stands the king, the heavenly one, The life-giving water-drops, from Tahiti. Lanai was found an adopted child.” [ ]"

A penei e heluhelu ai i ke mele ma ka pauku 5:","But in the tradition regarding Kahoolawe its origin is assured, it was born a foundling. Because Keaukanai was the man, he married with Walinuu, a woman from Holani, and Kahoolawe was the offspring of that union. And this is the way the mele runs in the fifth verse:"
"“Na Keaukanai i moe aku, Moe ia Walinuu o Holani, He keakea kapu no Uluhina, Hanau Kahoolawe, he lopa.”","“Keaukanai is the one who married, Married with Walinuu from Holani, The sacred semen of Uluhina. Kahoolawe was born a foundling.”"
"O ka mea kupanaha keia i ka nana ana i ka moolelo no Kahoolawe, mehe mea la no Hawaii nei o Keaukanai, a no Holani mai o Walinuu.

In the traditions of Molokini it is said, it was from the loin cloth of Uluhina, a very high chief. He was a chief who cut the navel of new born babes. And this is the legend concerning Molokini: “When Walinuu gave birth to Kahoolawe Uluhina was called upon to come and cut the navel of the child Kahoolawe, and when he came and had cut the navel he took the placenta and girt it on as a loin cloth. He then threw it into the sea and Molokini arose formed from the afterbirth of Kahoolawe and the loin cloth of Uluhina,” the very name Molokini being a contraction of the words malo and Uluhina and should read this way in the song, verse 6:"
"“Kiina aku Uluhina, Moku ka piko o ke kamaiki, Ka iewe o ke keiki i lele I komo i loko o ka ape nalu; Ka apeape kai aleale, Loaa ka malo o ke kama.

"“Ku mai Ahukinialaa, He alii mai ka nanamu; Mai ka ape o ka ia ; Mai ka ale poi pu o Halehalekalani, Loaa o Oahu, he wohi, He wohi na Ahukinialaa Na Laamealaakona he wahine.”","“Now stands forth Ahukini-a-Laa, A chief from the foreign land; From the gills of the fish; From the overwhelming billows of Halehalekalani. Then was born Oahu, a wohi, A wohi through Ahukinialaa By Laamealaakona, the wife.” [ ]"

Because Ahukinialaa lived with Laamealaakona and Oahu was born a wohi, then Laakapu lived with Laamealaakona and Kauai was born and this is how the legend runs: When Laamealaakona first had the child-sickness when conceiving Kauai, she was in the sacred house in the enclosure of the heiau (temple) of Nonea, and on a day of the month of Makalii, the day in which the lightnings flashed around this heiau, that was the day Kauai was born, and this is the king who united with the royal line of Hawaii. And this is how the legend runs in the part concerning Kauai in the mele commencing with verse 8:"
"“Na Laakapu he kane ia, Na Laamealaakona he wahine Hookauhua hoiloli, I ka Nuupoki alii, Ka heiau kapu a Nonea I kauwila i ka po kapu o Makalii, Hanau Kauai he alii, he kama, he pua alii.

Then was born Kauai, a chief, a prince, a kingly scion, Of the chiefly cluster belonging to Hawaii; The foremost head of all the islands.”"
"Ma ka nana aku i ka moolelo o Oahu me Kauai, he oiaio, me he mea la hookahi io no makuawahine o laua, no ka mea, ma ke ano o ka leo ka like ana.","So in looking over the histories of Oahu and Kauai, it is true, it seems as if they had one mother, for the voice indicates the resemblance."
"Ma ka moolelo o Niihau, o Kaula, ame Nihoa, hookahi no o lakou mau makua.

They were triplets, and with them the mother became barren. No islands were born afterwards. And the mele composed by Kahakuikamoana should read like this, in verse 10:"
"“O Wanalia ke kane, O Hanalaa ka wahine. Hanau Niihau he aina, he moku, Ekolu lakou keiki I hanau i ka la kahi. O Niihau, o Kaula, Nihoa pau mai.

There were three children of them Born in the same day; Niihau, Kaula, ending with Nihoa. The mother then conceived no more, No other island appeared afterwards.”"

But we cannot certify to the absolute truth of the story; there are several other stories very much like these, but which one is the real truth it is hard to tell. In the story or tradition of Wakea the origin of these islands is plainly told, and there are also meles reciting the doings of Wakea with regard to the peopling of these islands. One of the songs was composed by Pakui, a historian and a famous composer of songs, and he was classed among the high priests of the order of priesthood. [ ]"
"Ma ka moolelo hoi o Opuukahonua, ua oleloia i loko oia moolelo, oia na kupuna mua o Hawaii nei, he iwakalua-kumamaha hanauna mamua aku o Wakea, alaila huipu mai me ko Wakea hanauna he kanahiku-kumamalima, a i ka hui ana, he kanaiwakumamaiwa hanauna mai a Opuukahonua a hiki ia Kamehameha, alaila e hui mai mai laila mai a hiki ia Kamehameha IV he haneri kumamakahi hanauna.","In the tradition of Opuukahonua it is told in that story that they were the progenitors of Hawaii nei. There were twenty-four generations before Wakea, and as there were seventy-five generations from the time of Wakea would make ninety-nine generations from Opuukahonua to that of Kamehameha, therefore, till the reign of Kamehameha IV makes one hundred and one generations."

It is told in the history of Wakea and his wife Papa that these islands were born from them. And some of the historians believed that these islands were really made and put together by the hands of Wakea. But one of the priests, called Pakui, who was a great historian of Kamehameha’s time and a lineal descendant of historians from the very darkest ages, says “these islands were really born.” And this is how he composed his mele reciting the events which gave birth to these islands:"
"Ma keia mele e hoomaopopo ai i ka laha ana o keia mau aina e Wakea laua me Papa, e like me ka ike a Pakui ka mea nana i haku i keia mele, he kahuna ia, he kakaolelo no loko mai o ka papa mookuauhau o na kahuna nui o ka oihanakahuna.

He was a priest and a historian belonging to the board of historians and genealogist of the order of the priesthood. But in looking at Chapter I of this story the ideas of the historian are very similar in regard to the birth or appearance of these islands. Also in the song composed by Pakui in his capacity as a prophet and historian, as seen in this chapter, but it will be well to note the setting of the genealogy from the time of Wakea, as shown in the following chapter."
"“O Wakea Kahiko Luamea, o Papa hanau moku ka wahine. Hanau Tahiti-ku, Tahiti-moe, Hanau Keapapanui. Hanau Keapapalani.”","“Wakea was the old one of Luamea, and Papa giving birth to islands was the wife. Tahiti-ku of the rising sun and Tahiti-moe of the setting sun was born, The foundation stones were born And also the stones of heaven. ”"
"A nolaila o na mea mua keia i loaa i loko o ko Wakea mau la laua o Papa, a mahope o Hawaii ka hanau ana e like me malalo iho.","Therefore these were the first products of the union of Wakea and Papa; Hawaii was born afterwards, as told here below:"

Mumu was their first-born, then came Wawa, then Ahewahewa, then Lulukaina and then Kalino making five sons. Then came Mailelaulii, Mailekaluhea, Mailepakaha, Mailehaiwale and last came Kaulanapokii making five daughters. After the children were grown up, Mailelaulii asked her younger sisters, saying: “Let us go sight seeing hereabouts.” They then started out and went as far as Huehue from which point Kohala can be seen. On beholding the white sands of Kiholo and Kapalaoa they were enticed to go on. When they arrived at Kapalaoa they thought they would keep on to Kalahuipuaa. Upon arriving at Kalahuipuaa they met Puako."
"He kanaka maikai o Puako, he ui, aohe puu, aohe kee, lawe ae la ia ia Mailelaulii i wahine, a moe iho la lakou ia po a ao ae la.

When he saw Mailelaulii he took her to be his wife and that night they were covered with the same kapa. Very early the next morning the girls looked and saw Puako carrying sea water and filling pools for salt making. Upon seeing this the sisters got disgusted and said to Mailelaulii: “Say, if that is going to be your husband we will all be made weary carrying [ ] sea water for salt making and our skins will look like the windward bark of a noni tree.” Mailelaulii then said to Puako: “My sisters are urging me to continue on our way sight seeing.” Puako consented to this, so the girls departed on their way to Kohala. When they arrived at Kokoiki, in Kohala, they met Hikapoloa, the chief of Puuepa and Hukiaa; as he was a single man he took Mailelaulii to be his wife: so the sisters took up their residence in Kohala."
"A liuliu iho, holo kekahi poe o Kohala i ke kalepa ia i ke kaha, a hala loa i Kona a Holualoa, kahi o Mumu ma. O ka Mumu ma hana me na kaikaina o ka lawaia, o ke aku ka ia a me na ia e ae, a na lakou ua pa ai nei i ke aku. No laila ka ia a ka poe kalepa o Kohala i holo aku ai.","Shortly after this some of the Kohala people sailed for Kekaha and from there continued on to Holualoa, Kona, for the purpose of trade, where they met Mumu and his brothers. Mumu and his brothers were fishermen and caught aku and all other kinds of fish. They had in their possession some very rare pearl fish-hooks, which supplied them with all the aku they wanted. The Kohala traders got their fish from Mumu and his brothers."
"Hoi mai la lakou a Puuepa, lawe mai la i kekahi mau ia na Hikapoloa a me na wahine. Ninau aku la lakou: “Nohea ka oukou ia?” “No Holualoa.” “Na wai la o Holualoa?” “Na Mumu ma.” I aku lakou ia Hikapoloa: “O ko makou mau kaikunane ia, elima ko lakou nui, he poe lawaia wale no.” Olelo mai o Hikapoloa: “Pehea, loaa no ia’u ka pa ke kii?” “Ae, aole e aua ia oe, ke olelo aku oe he kaikoeke oe no lakou, a ke hai aku oe o Mailelaulii kau wahine.”","On returning to Kohala the traders upon arriving at Puuepa took some of the fish to Hikapoloa, his wife and sisters. When the fish was given to them the sisters asked: “Where did you get your fish from?” “From Holualoa.” “From whom at Holualoa?” “From Mumu and his brothers.” The sisters then said to Hikapoloa: “They are our brothers. There are five of them and all fishermen.” Hikapoloa then asked: “Do you think I will be able to get a pearl fish-hook if I should go for one?” “Yes, they will not refuse you one if you tell them that you are their brother-in-law and if you tell them that Mailelaulii is your wife.”"
"Holo aku la o Hikapoloa a pae ma Holualoa, i ka lawaia na kaikoeke a hoi mai la, e noho ana keia i ka hale. Hai aku la o Hikapoloa i na kaikoeke, e like me ka olelo a na kaikuahine.

Upon his arrival his brothers-in-law were out fishing so he awaited for their return. Upon being told that he was their brother-in-law, they asked him: “What is the object of your visit?” “I have come for a pearl fish-hook for aku fishing. That is the only thing that has brought me here, nothing else.” “Yes, you shall have a pearl fish-hook. Here it is, with the rod and line.” When Hikapoloa came home his canoes were loaded down with dry aku as well as with fresh aku."
"Hai mai la o Hikapoloa a hiki i Kohala, noho iho la a liuliu, hoolale aku la i na waa a me na kaohi.

When the canoes were ready they started out and upon coming to the aku grounds he took up the fish-hook and held it in his hand, thinking that the aku would jump into the canoe of their own accord. He held the hook this way all day until the paddlers were stiff with cold, but no aku was caught. Upon failing to get any aku he took it as sufficient cause for the death of his brothers-in-law. When they arrived home, Hikapoloa did not tell his wife of his plans to kill his brothers-in-law; but he told the watchman at Kukuipahu, the place where the canoes from Kona generally make their landing, saying: “In case my brothers-in-law from Kona should arrive, don’t give them any food; tell them they can get their food up at Hikapoloa’s place.” Hikapoloa then prepared firewood and the umu, and then selected a guard for the door who was already armed with a stone axe and instructed him that when any head should enter the door to cut it off."

After a while there was no food to be had in the district; Kohala was the only [ ] place that had food, so Kalino said to his older brothers: “Let us sail to Kohala and get us some food.” The brothers consented to this; so they made ready and while on their way they fished for aku. When they arrived at Kukuipahu, in Kohala, their canoe was loaded down deep with aku. As they came ashore they were all faint with hunger from want of food; so they went to the house of the watchman expecting to obtain some food. When they arrived at the house the watchman said: “Your brother-in-law has left word that you go right on up as he has the food for you.” The younger brothers then said to Mumu: “You go on up and when you get there bring us some food. After we have some food we will also go up. Don’t be long.” Mumu then took up an aku and started on his way to Puuiki, a hill looking down on Kukuipahu and from which point the houses of Hikapoloa could be seen. As he reached the top of the hill, the watchman called out to Hikapoloa: “Say, I see a man, he comes running with a fish in his hand.” Hikapoloa looked and saw it was Mumu, so he said: “It is the brother of Mailelaulii.” When Mumu arrived outside of the enclosure surrounding the house, he asked of the watchman: “Where are the chiefesses?” The watchman said: “That is afterwards; enter the house and have some food first, then you may see your relations.” On thus being invited, Mumu entered the enclosure and went up to the house. The inner guard then called out: “Come in.” At this Mumu entered, head first, when down came the axe and the head was cut off from the body. The head rolled off to some distance and then asked:"
"E ui aku, e ninau, I ka hala i make ai ke kanaka; Heaha ka hala o kanaka i make ai?",Inquire and ask For the fault why the man was killed; What is the fault that a man should be killed?
"I aku o Hikapoloa: “He hala. O ka pa ai ole, haawi ia mai, o ka pa ai, aua ia aku. Oia ka hala.” Pane hou mai ke poo o Mumu ia Hikapoloa:",Hikapoloa answered: “There is a fault. The pearl fish-hook that was worthless was given to me and the pearl fish-hook that the aku is fond of was kept back. That is the fault.” The head of Mumu again inquired of Hikapoloa:
"Ua makaukau ka umu, ua enaena; ia wa, kalua ia ke kino o Mumu i ka umu, a moa, olelo o Hikapoloa: “O ka mea ikaika i ka ai ana, e lilo ke ahupuaa nui iaia.

After it was cooked Hikapoloa said: “The person who will eat the biggest amount shall be presented with the largest ahupuaa.” After the body was eaten the bones were thrown onto a pile of sugar-cane trash. The younger brothers in the meantime awaited for the return of their brother. After some time had lapsed Ahewahewa went up and he also was killed. The next one followed and so on down to Kalino. When it came to Kalino’s turn, he took up an aku and started off. When he got to Puuiki, he was seen, and the watchman called out to Hikapoloa: “Say, there is a thin man coming up.” Hikapoloa answered: “It must be Kalino; he must be coming up sideways for he is a large man. He is the last one, the youngest of the brothers.” When Kalino arrived with the aku in his hand, he asked the watchman: “Where are the chiefesses?” “You can see them later on, enter first and help yourself to some food, then afterwards go and see them.” Kalino then entered the house, when down came the axe and his head was cut off. The head of Kalino then asked:"
"I aku o Hikapoloa: “He hala. O ka pa ai ole, haawi ia mai, o ka pa ai, aua ia aku, oia ka hala i make ai.” Olelo mai ke poo o Kalino:",Hikapoloa answered: “There is a fault. The pearl fish-hook that was worthless was given to me and the pearl fish-hook that the aku is fond of was kept back. That is the fault why he should be killed.” The head of Kalino then answered:
"Kalua ia o Kalino a moa i ka umu, ai ia iho la, a koe ka iwi kiola ia i waho o ke opu ahuawa.",Kalino’s body was then cooked in the umu and was then eaten up; and the bones were thrown in a heap of ahuawa.
"Elima lakou nei, elima umu, elima wahie, eia na wahie.","There were five brothers, requiring five umus and five different kinds of firewood:"
"O Mumu, ke kanaka, he opiko kona wahie; O Wawa, ke kanaka, he aaka kona wahie, O Ahewahewa, ke kanaka, he mamane kona wahie. O Lulukaina, ke kanaka, he pua kona wahie.

They were closed up in another house, never once coming out; as people while composing a name chant were restricted and not allowed to go in and out of the house. But Kaulanapokii, the youngest of the sisters, saw the spirits of their brothers standing without heads; five bodies headless, whereupon she wept and walked back and forth within the house. Kaulanapokii was a woman who had supernatural powers and could see certain things. This power is even now possessed by the doctors who give medicines in her name."
"E olelo iki kakou no Kaulanapokii. He wahine mana o Kaulanapokii, he ike; o ia mana a hiki i keia la, a ke lilo nei oia i kumu lapaau, a haha paaoao.

We are composing a chant, but you are walking back and forth.” Kaulanapokii replied: “Our brothers have all been killed by your husband, for I see all five of them standing without heads. ” The sisters then all began weeping for their brothers, but Kaulanapokii stopped them saying: “Don’t weep.” Kaulanapokii then told her sister Mailelaulii: “Sit down and force the child to come forth at this time, so that your husband upon hearing the child will come in here, when he shall be killed.” Through the supernatural powers of Kaulanapokii, the child came forth although the time for its delivery was not yet come. This was caused through the anger of Kaulanapokii. As the child came forth, Kaulanapokii took it by the feet and held the child up, at the same time calling to Hikapoloa: “Come and get your child.” Hikapoloa then came into the house. As he entered, Kaulanapokii called out to her sisters:"
"E, Mailelaulii, Mailekaluhea, Mailepakaha, Mailehaiwale, E ke ie! E ka mana wai, E kahihi kua, e kahihi alo.

The rain beat down in torrents, the wind blew in a gale and the fog and mist covered the land. This prevented Hikapoloa from getting out, as the ie and maile had entangled the whole house. Upon seeing this the priest, Kehoni by name, who had entered with Hikapoloa, called out:"
E Kaulanapokii e! Ka wahine mana o ka la komo Ka ulu loaa ole i ka lou ia No’u kekahi ola.,"Say, Kaulanapokii, The all-powerful woman from the eastern sun, The breadfruit that cannot be reached with a pole, Allow me a pathway."

Hikapoloa died and the house was set on fire. Kaulanapokii then proceeded to the place where her brothers had been killed and called in a chant:"
Ka uwahi opiko o uka e aala mai nei e! Ua ike paha oe i kuu kaikunane o Mumu.,"Say, thou smoke of the opiko send your fragrance from the uplands, Perchance you have seen my brother Mumu?"
"“Ae, ua ike, aia i ka puainako na iwi.” Hele aku la keia ohi, houluulu a kahi hookahi, pela no ka ia nei hana a hiki ia Kalino, oia ka lima:","“Yes, I have seen him, his bones are lying there on the pile of sugar-cane trash.” Kaulanapokii then proceeded to the rubbish pile and collected the bones together. She then called each brother in turn collecting their bones together until it was the turn of her fifth brother, Kalino, when she called:"
Ka uwahi alani o uka e aala mai nei e! O ka wahie paha oe o kuu kaikunane i moa ai.,"Say, thou smoke of the alani, send your fragrance from the uplands, Are you not the wood with which my brother was cooked?"

He has been consumed and the bones are there in the ahuawa heap where they now lie.” Kaulanapokii proceeded to the place indicated and collected them. After all the bones had been collected, Kaulanapokii said to her sisters: “Let us work on our brothers and when they come to life again we will return to Kona.” The sisters then first took up Mumu and after he came back to life the others were taken up. After all the brothers had been restored to life, they all returned to Kona, where they all made oath, that they would never be covered over with the same kapa with any man or woman from Kohala. This oath was even taken up and kept by their children after them. Thus did they forsake the proud land of Kohala and its favorite wind, the aeloa. [ ]"

When he first came to the place there was no food growing, no taro, no potatoes, no yams, nor anything else in the shape of food. All the food had been taken and hidden by the gods in Kalae, Kau. Once upon a time Pupuhuluena had a desire to go fishing, so he sailed to a point directly off Makaukiu. While he was busy fishing, he saw that all the different fishes were gathered under his canoe; the uhu, the nenue, ulua, kahala, opakapaka, hee, manini, opelu, aku and all the other kinds of fishes. When he saw the fish move away he followed them until the cliffs were passed, and as the fish kept on going he followed right along; he arrived off Kohala, still the fish kept on: he arrived off Kawaihae, still the fish kept on: then on to Puako and to Maniniowali where the manini remained behind, but he still followed until he was off Kekaha and from there on to Kaelehuluhulu; here the aku and opakapaka remained behind. Proceeding again until he was off the Kona coast, here some of the other fishes remained behind, but he kept on following the others until he was off the place called Kapukaulua, just this side of Kalae where the ulua remained behind. At this place he saw a canoe floating with a large-mouth net let down on the coral bed. There were two fishermen in the canoe, Ieiea and Poopalu; they were the fishermen of Makalii."
"Nana aku la o Pupuhuluena, e lana ana keia waa lawaia, he upena waha nui ka upena e kuu ana. O ka inoa o keia mau lawaia, o Ieiea, o Poopalu, he mau lawaia na Makalii.

He then took up a kukui nut, chewed it up and blew the substance upon the surface of the sea which enabled him to clearly see the bottom. As he looked down he saw the fish entering the mouth of the net, let down by Ieiea and Poopalu, so he called out: “Say, the fish have gone into your net.” “You are telling a lie. We are looking down and we don’t see any fish going in.” The reason why Ieiea and Poopalu did not see the fish was because they were chewing the sea-bean (mohihi) and blowing the juice on the surface of the sea which did not render the sea smooth, so they were unable to see the bottom very clearly. The place where they had their net was not very deep. Pupuhuluena, however, kept on calling to haul up the net till at last Ieiea and Poopalu thought they would haul up the net, when to their surprise they discovered it was full of fish. When Ieiea and Poopalu saw that Pupuhuluena had something they did not have they requested some kukui nut; so Pupuhuluena gave some of his nuts to the fishermen and they threw away their sea-beans. These two fishermen kept some of the nuts and when they arrived home they planted some. This is how the kukui was first introduced into the districts of Kona and Kau."
"Haawi mai la o Poopalu i ka ai, he kalo moa, he uala, lalau aku la keia a ho-o i ka hokeo. Ninau mai o Poopalu: “I mea aha ia au, e waiho nei i ka hokeo?” I aku o [ ] Pupuhuluena: “I mea kanu.” Olelo mai o Poopalu: “Aole e ulu, ua moa, no ka mea, aia no i ke akua ka ai, a me na mea a pau, aia a moa loaa mai ia maua ka ai.

A loaa ke kii me ka hinai ie, olelo mai o Poopalu ia Pupuhuluena: “O ke kii mahope ou i luna o ka waa, a owau iloko o ka hinai, e holo kaua i ka aina o ke ’kua.”","Poopalu then gave Pupuhuluena some kalo and potatoes already cooked. Pupuhuluena took them and placed them in his calabash. At this Poopalu asked him: “Why do you put them in the calabash?” Pupuhuluena replied: “To save them for planting.” [ ] Poopalu said: “They will not grow as they are already cooked. The gods have charge of the food and all else, and we can only get it after it is cooked. If you wish to get some for the purpose of planting then obey this instruction: You must first hew out an image from a wiliwili tree and then braid a basket of ie.” Pupuhuluena then consented to do this. After the image and basket were made, Poopalu said to Pupuhuluena: “Place the image behind you on the canoe while I will get into the basket and then we will sail to the land of the gods.”"

Poopalu, however, instructed Pupuhuluena from within the basket to say: “That is a refuse heap; here is the landing place where the surf is breaking, for I am a native son of this place.” When the gods heard Pupuhuluena, they remarked amongst themselves: “He is a native son of the soil and not a stranger.” The regular landing place then became calm while the rough sea went back to the place opposite the refuse heap. As Pupuhuluena went ashore, the gods came down to help him lift the canoe. At this Pupuhuluena said: “The stern of my canoe is kapued. I will lift that part myself while you can lift the forward part.” After the canoe was carried ashore, the gods brought all the different kinds of tubers and showed them to Pupuhuluena, saying:"
"Pupuhuluena, Kapala, Kapakio, Heaha nei ai ia oe la?","Pupuhuluena, Kapala, Kapakio, What kind of food is this?"
"Olelo ae o Poopalu i loko o ka hinai: “E olelo aku oe, he hoi, he ai make,” pela ke aoao ana a lohe a Pupuhuluena, kahea aku o Pupuhuluena:","Poopalu spoke from within the basket: “Tell them it is a Hoi, it is poisonous.” So Pupuhuluena chanted back:"

One day to dig it, One day to stand it in water, One day to render it sweet, One day to warm it in the sun. But with all that, the children will die from eating it. It has sprouted, it is growing over yonder."
"Hoike hou ke ’kua, he uhi ia ai: “Heaha nei ai ia oe e Pupuhuluena?”","The gods then brought out another tuber and asked: “What is this food called, Pupuhuluena?”"
"He uhi he ai ola, Kii aku no kalua A moa, ola ka wahine.","It is a yam, it is a life-giving food, Go for it and bake it. When cooked, your wife is then sustained."

While playing in a certain game, Pupuhuluena took some of the gods and stood them up on their heads. This action so shamed them that they gave Pupuhuluena each of the different tubers. Pupuhuluena then returned to Kohala and planted the yam, and yam can be found at the bottom of the cliffs to the east of Kohala to this day; also the kalo, potatoes, gourds, and all the different tubers. It was Pupuhuluena who first introduced them into Kohala. [ ]"

Pueonuiokona was the king of Kauai at this time. Because of this death of Halepaki, Kaipalaoa took up the profession of wrangling or disputation. Wailea, his mother, was skilled in the profession and so took the education of her son upon herself until all she knew had been imparted to the boy. She then said to him: “Go to your aunt who lives in Kohala, the wife of Kukuipahu, Kalenaihaleauau by name. She will complete your education.”"

She taught him all she knew relating to the profession: the things above and the things below, in the uplands and in the lowlands; the things that happen by day and the things that happen by night; of death and of life; of good and of evil. She taught him all that she knew, whereupon he was classed as an expert, and soon after arose and went in search of his father. He took along with him a calabash in which were stored all the things relating to his profession and proceeded to the sea coast where a canoe was lying. He took the canoe and started on his journey, first landing at Keoneoio at Honuaula where he spent the night. Early the next morning he again boarded his canoe and set sail landing at Kaunolu, Lanai. From this place he again set sail and landed at Kalaau Point, near Kaunakakai, Molokai, where he stayed over night. On the next day he left Molokai and set sail for Oahu, landing at Hanauma where he left his canoe and proceeded overland; he first stopped at Kaimuki, then at Niuhelewai, where he took a bath, then continued on his way till he came to Pokai, in Waianae, where he spent the night. When he woke up the next morning he saw the canoes of Pueonuiokona, from Kauai, preparing for their return, so he proceeded to the landing place and asked of the men that he be allowed to accompany them to Kauai. At this request the men said: “Be off, you shameless youngster , you shall not take passage in the king’s canoes.” When the king heard his men talking he called out: “Young man, come here to me.” When the boy stood in the presence of the king, the king asked him: “What [ ] were you saying to the men?” “ I was asking them that I be allowed passage on the canoes to Kauai; but they told me that the canoes belonged to the king.” Pueonuiokona then said: “You may take passage in one of them. Have you any baggage to take along?” The boy answered: “No, except that I have a calabash of clothes. ” “Well, get it and come here and we will sail.”"

Taking his calabash he proceeded to the landing and took one of the canoes that were lying there and set out for Kauai. The king, accompanied by his men, got to the landing and waited for the boy until noon, but as he did not appear the canoes were ordered to sail. When Kauai was seen, those with the king saw something floating ahead of them, and when they drew nearer to the object they saw it was a canoe with the boy in it. The king then called out to the boy: “I see that you came ahead of us and we wasted our time waiting for you.” “Yes, I thought that the king’s canoes were already overloaded with bulky things and with big men and large packages, so I made up my mind to come ahead in the dark with the idea, however, of being overtaken by you here in mid-ocean.” A rope was then thrown to the boy which he made fast to his canoe and he was towed on until they landed in Hanalei, Kauai."

At seeing this the boy asked the king: “Oh king, let me have some fish.” The king answered: “Take one of the canoes of fish for you.” The boy, however, reached down and only took up two fish, one was an oililepa and the other a kikakapu. The king then asked the boy: “Are those the only fish you are going to take?” “These are all the fish I am going to take as they are the kind that will cook quickly.” Soon after this the boy left Hanalei and proceeded on his way, going by way of Koolau until he arrived at Waiakalua where he rested. From this place he continued on to Anahola; thence on to Kealia and then on to Wailua where Kalanialiiloa resided, where was his bone fence, almost completed, built from human bones. When he arrived at the place he looked and saw the bones of Halepaki his father; they were still fresh, the bones not yet being bleached. At sight of this the boy bowed in sorrow and wept. After his weeping he approached the flagstaff and pushed it down and put up the oililepa, one of the fish brought along by him. He then next took the kapu stick and pushed it down and put up in its place the other fish, the kikakapu. By this action of the boy, it was meant as a challenge to the people that he was come to meet them in a wrangling contest. When Kalanialiiloa and his instructors saw the action of the boy, they knew at once that he was challenging them to a contest of wits, so a messenger was dispatched to meet the boy showing the challenge was accepted."

Upon hearing this the chief said: “Go down again and if he asks you to go down, say yes to it. When you proceed to go down, he will then come up here.” The man again returned to the boy and called out: “Young contestant, the chief invites you to come on up.” The boy replied: “Full-grown contestant, the chief invites you to come on down.” The man then proceeded on down and the boy went on up to the chief’s place."

You shall remain there and die there. For die you must, young man, for you cannot come in here.” The boy saw at once that no time would be wasted by the Kauai people nor would they allow him time to prepare himself although he knew that that was a part of the profession; but they did not, however, find him unprepared, the boy immediately replied: “You must then remain in there, you full-grown men until you die. Eat up what food you have, obey the calls of nature, and eat, you must die within for you cannot come out.” At this Kalanialiiloa spoke up: “The boy is indeed right. He is on the outside where he can sleep and get up and can go where he pleases; whereas we are huddled up in here, and after we have eaten up our food and fish and have drunk up our water we will not be able to get any more as we cannot go out. We will, therefore, remain in here until we die. It is, therefore, best that we befriend the boy and allow him to enter.” The instructors, however, refused to allow this. In this both sides came out even. The men had intended to best the boy in their battle of witty remarks when the boy would have been killed."

They then poured water on the dirt and made mud, making it unfit for any person to sit down on. They then called for the boy, saying: “You will surely die now for we have taken up all the covering from the floor leaving it bare.” The boy then entered the house and looked down at the lowest battens, which were next to the ground and then addressed his calabash: “Say, you must sit down here on this part of the floor where it has a covering.” At this the men said: “You are a deceiving young man, there is no covering left on the floor, for we have taken it all up.” The boy replied: “When the framework of this house was put up the battens were put on, beginning with the lowest one called the bottom covering. If so, then why can not I call it a covering.” “And why not? It is a covering because it is laid at the bottom, and furthermore the rest of the battens are fastened above that one,” said the chief. The men said: “The boy may have beaten us in that, but he will never find this our next move.” The men then spread out makaloa grass on the floor, then their Niihau mats over the grass, then took out their kapas made on Kauai and laid them down, saying: “Die you must, young man, for we have taken everything and left you nothing.” At this the boy reached for his calabash, uncovered it, reached in [ ] and took out some kuolohia grass and spread it out, then took out a mat, then a covering made from fragrant hala blossoms of Puna and spread it out, then an ouholowai kapa robe, of Olaa, all strongly scented with the olapa."

The men then said: “He may have all these things, but he will not have anything to show in our next move, when he will surely be killed.” The men then ordered that they prepare wood for the umu, start the fire and strangle the pig; and when the pig was cooked to drink awa. Both sides then started to carry this out and to see which side would drink awa first. The boy then reached for the calabash, took out some wood already split up into small pieces and tied up into a bundle, took off the string and let the wood fall out; he next reached for a small bundle of pebbles, to serve as stones for his umu, placed them on the wood and started the fire; he next reached for a piece of kukui wood, called puaa, which was made into the shape of a pig; he next reached for the cord and proceeded to wind it around one end of the piece of wood. At the process of winding the string, a squeaking noise was heard, to which the boy said: “What a squeaking pig this is.” He then placed it on the umu and peeled off the bark leaving the white wood exposed; the next thing was to cut it open which he did and took out a piece of pork and portions of the offal of a pig, which had already been wrapped up in this piece of wood, and he then went through the act of cooking it in the umu. After the supposed pig was put in the umu, he reached for a few pieces of umu covering from his calabash and covered up the umu."

After the pigs were cooked the others proceeded to cut up a real pig, while the boy took out his piece of pork from within the kukui wood and began his meal, first drinking his awa. When the boy finished his meal his head bowed down being overcome by the effects of the awa."

The men began reciting their verses with certain of their number sitting in the rear of the reciters going through certain motions. When it came to the boy’s turn, he placed a wooden image behind him and began his recital. At this the men said: “It is indeed strange that you should have a wooden image to make the motions for you, while we had those who could talk and recite with those who chanted.” The boy replied: “You are all wrong. All great and noted chanters while reciting verses are always accompanied by those who make the motions in silence; the only voice to be heard is from the one doing the reciting.

It was Laukiamanuikahiki’s custom to bring in other children to their home and give them all the food; which action caused her father to get angry and very often punished her. This punishment was kept up by the father for some time. Because of this, the child suspected that this man could not be her own father; so she began questioning her mother who her own father was until the mother could bear it no longer. Hina then said to Laukiamanuikahiki: “You go to that cliff; that is your father.” Upon coming to the cliff, she asked: “Are you my father?” The cliff denied this saying: “I am not your father.” The child returned to Hina and begged: “Tell me of my father.” “Yes, you go to that bambu bush, that is your father.” When she arrived at the place, she asked the bambu bush: “Are you my father?” “I am not your father, Makiioeoe is your father, he has gone back to Kuaihelani.” When Laukiamanuikahiki again arrived in the presence of her mother she said: “You have deceived me. Makiioeoe I understand is my father and he has gone back to Kuaihelani. You have hidden this from me.” “Yes, he is your father, and he has left word that you must not come to him without a sign or you will have a terrible suffering. You have to go to him in a red canoe having red sails, red cords, red men and must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men.” Laukiamanuikahiki [ ] replied: “I am not going to remain, I am going in search of my father.” “Yes, you may go, but you will have to suffer untold agony. Go until you come to two old women roasting bananas by the wayside. They are your grandmothers, for they are my own mother and aunt. Reach down and take away the bananas and let them search for them until they ask whose offspring you are, then tell them, ‘Your own.’ ‘Ours from whom?’ ‘From Hina.’ Then when they ask you, ‘What brings you our lord here to us?’ Tell them, ‘I want a roadway.’ ”"

At the conclusion the old women said: “There is a roadway; here it is, a bambu stalk. You climb to the top of it and when it leans over it will reach Kuaihelani.” Laukiamanuikahiki then climbed to the top of the bambu stalk and sat there. The bambu then began to shoot up and when it had reached a great distance it leaned over until the end reached Kuaihelani. Laukiamanuikahiki stepped off the bambu and proceeded along the road until she met a girl whom she took as a friend. They then went along until they came to a flower garden. The flowers of this garden were all kapu; none were to string them into wreaths until they shall have been picked by the daughter of Makiioeoe; the flowers of the ilima, the marigold and other flowers and also the maile vine. There were guards in the garden who were watching the flowers. Laukiamanuikahiki, however, reached out and picked the flowers, took the maile vines and broke them off. When they came to the pool of water, which had been kapued until it was first used by the daughter of Makiioeoe, Laukiamanuikahiki uncovered herself and plunged into the pool of water, when a turtle came up to her and began rubbing her back . After she finished bathing she went up on the bank. When the guards saw what she had done, they said: “You are indeed a strange girl bathing in the pool of water which is kapued and reserved only for the king’s daughter. You will indeed die.” When the guards arrived in the presence of Makiioeoe, they told him of all the girl’s doings. Makiioeoe then ordered that wood be prepared for the girl and to pack it to the seashore where the umu was to be started the next day, for on that day the girl was to be killed. The guards then returned, took the girl by the hands, bound them at her back and led her to the pig house where she was tied, the guards standing watch over her that night. That night her friend came and asked that she too be bound; but Laukiamanuikahiki said: “No, you must be at liberty so as to bring me food, meat and clothing.” Her friend consented to this."

This owl was the supernatural aunt of Hina, who had come all the way from Kauai because she knew of the coming peril of her grandchild, and who had in its keeping the tokens that had been given by Makiioeoe to Hina by the means of which she was to be known or recognized upon her arrival at Kuaihelani.

He then broke into the house , took up his daughter and wept over her. After the guards had departed to inform the king, the owl flew down and clapped its wings on the girl, placed the necklace of whale’s teeth around the girl’s neck, girded [ ] a pa-u around her waist and placed the feather cloak over her. These being the tokens left by Makiioeoe in the keeping of Hina. After it had become broad daylight, Makiioeoe ordered that the umu be started; when it was sufficiently heated the people who had ill-used the girl were then thrown into the umu and they all perished. The girl who befriended Laukiamanuikahiki was made a high chiefess and she lived with Laukiamanuikahiki. Soon after this a kapu was placed over Laukiamanuikahiki and she was forbidden from going out of her living house and no one was allowed to pass by her house or to speak to her. Laukiamanuikahiki was a very beautiful woman to behold and she had no equal in all the land of Kuaihelani, for her beauty could be seen on the outside of the house, like a bright light."

This young man was married to Kahalaokolepuupuu of Kahikiku and had come to Kuaihelani without his wife on a visit to his parents. When Kahikiula arrived he was accompanied by his followers in a red canoe, with red sails, red cords, red paddles, red men, large canoes, small canoes, large men and small men. Upon the arrival of Kahikiula at Kuaihelani he was met by his mother and father and all the people. Soon after this Makiioeoe requested Kahikiula to go and meet his sister, Laukiamanuikahiki, which invitation was accepted. When they were near the house, Kahikiula looked and saw a bright light on the outside of the house; so he said to Makiioeoe: “Say, your house is on fire!” Makiioeoe replied: “That is not a fire, it is some person sleeping within, it is your sister.” They then entered the house and Makiioeoe approached the bed and roused his daughter saying: “Wake up, here is your brother Kahikiula.” Laukiamanuikahiki awoke from her sleep and turned down on her breast. She then looked up at Kahikiula and greeted him. What a sight it was to behold these two; one was as handsome as the other was beautiful; both were equal in good looks, Kahikiula and Laukiamanuikahiki."

They lived as husband and wife for fifty days when Kahikiula begged that he be allowed to return to Kahikiku. Laukiamanuikahiki then said: “You cannot go unless you take me along with you.” “It cannot be, for you will surely experience terrible suffering through the anger of your sister-in-law. You must remain, and I will return.” As Kahikiula kept begging so often to return to Kahikiku, Laukiamanuikahiki finally consented and allowed him to go, saying: “Yes, you may return, but don’t blame me if I should decide to follow you later on, or I will kill you and also your wife, Kahalaokolepuupuu.” Kahikiula then took his departure and returned to Kahikiku to live with Kahalaokolepuupuu. Laukiamanuikahiki remained, but was so overcome with love for Kahikiula, that she wept; and when she saw the clouds drifting in the sky towards Kahikiku, she chanted the following lines:"
"Kau ana ka la e kau ana, Kau ana ke aloha i kuu maka, Ke hooluhi nei la i kuu kino, Ke lalawe nei la i kuu aoao, Aloha ka ukana a ke aloha la, He waimaka e. [ ]","The sun is up, it is up, My love is ever up before me. It is causing me great anxiety, It is pricking me at my side For love is a burden, when one is in love, And falling tears are its due.

"Hiki mai la ka honu kua wawaka wahi ae la ke kua a hamama, komo iho la keia i loko o ke kua, popoi ae la a paa, luu aku la ka honu a hiki i Kahikiku.

Laukiamanuikahiki then entered into the turtle, the top was closed and the turtle dove under water and swam until it arrived at Kahikiku. Upon its arrival at Kahikiku the turtle uncovered its back and Laukiamanuikahiki walked out on the seashore, while the turtle disappeared. Laukiamanuikahiki then went on her way until she came to a fish pond which belonged to Kahalaokolepuupuu, the wife of Kahikiula. At this place Laukiamanuikahiki changed herself into the form of an old woman and concealed her identity by calling out:"
"E kini o ke ’kua, E ka lehu o ke ’kua, E ka lalani o ke ’kua, E ka pukui o ke ’kua, E ke kaikuaana o ke ’kua, E ke kokoo-ha o ke ’kua E ke koo-lima o ke ’kua, E lawe ae oukou i kuu kino maikai, huna oukou a nalo, Haawi mai oukou i kino luahine no’u, kolopupu, haumakaiole.","Ye forty thousand gods, Ye four hundred thousand gods, Ye rows of gods, Ye collection of gods, Ye older brothers of the gods, Ye four-fold gods, Ye five-fold gods, Take away my good looks and keep it concealed.

Within this fish pond owned by Kahalaokolepuupuu, were kept the aholehole, nehu, iao, and all fish of this species and moss. Through the supernatural powers of Laukiamanuikahiki all the fish in the pond disappeared, which left the pond without a single fish. While she was crawling along the seashore two messengers from Kahalaokolepuupuu arrived and called out: “Say, you old woman, you have taken all the queen’s fish. You are a thieving old woman.” She replied: “I did not take them. The fish from this pond disappeared long before this; but since you have seen me here you are attributing their disappearance to me.” At this time she was given a new name, Lipewale, by the messengers. They then said to the old woman: “Let us go to the house, your name, Lipewale, is that of the queen’s sickness.” When they arrived at the house, one of the messengers said: “There is not a single fish in the pond, all have been taken by this old woman. When we found her she was taking the sea-eggs.” Kahalaokolepuupuu then addressed the old woman saying: “I am going to call you Lipewale, the name of my ailment. You will take this name, will you not? I will supply you with food, clothing, house to live in and you will live with me.”"
"Moe iho la lakou i ka po, hele mai la o Kahikiula ma kahi o Lipewale e moe nei, lele iho la honi i ka ihu, kahea ae keia: “Owai keia e honi nei ia’u?” Kahea mai o Kahalaokolepuupuu: “E Lipewale, heaha ia?” Paa loa ko ia nei waha, aohe ekemu aku.

[ ]","That night when they retired, Kahikiula approached the place where Lipewale was sleeping and kissed her. She then cried out: “Who is kissing me?” Upon hearing this Kahalaokolepuupuu called out: “What is it, Lipewale?” But she would not answer. In doing this Kahikiula showed that he had recognized his sister, Laukiamanuikahiki. [ ]"
"Pela ka ia nei mau hana i na po a pau loa; ina e ike keia e moe pu ana ke kaikunane me ka wahine i kahi hookahi, ala ae la keia hoonakeke i na paipu, holo mai la ke kaikoeke ninau, hai aku la keia he iole; no ka mea, he huhu keia i ka moe pu o laua la.","This was carried on for several nights. Whenever she knew that her brother and sister-in-law were about to retire together, she would get up and rattle the calabashes forcing her sister-in-law to come and ask her reason for thus creating a disturbance; when she would say, that it was a rat; she did this because she did not want them to sleep together."
"I mai la ke kaikoeke: “E Lipewale e pii kakou i kukui kapala no kuu pau, i uka.” Ae aku la keia: “Ae.” A hiki lakou i uka, hoiliili iho la a loaa ke kukui, hana iho la a haawe, olelo mai lao Kahalaokolepuupuu: “E Lipewale, ia oe ke kukui a kakou e haawe ai.” “Ae, ia’u.” Kaha aku la lakou la iho, kaa iho la o Lipewale mahope me ka haawe kukui.

When they arrived at the place, they collected the kukui nuts and put them into a bundle. After this was done Kahalaokolepuupuu said to Lipewale: “You will have to carry our bundle of kukui nuts.” “Yes, I will take it.” The others then went on ahead leaving Lipewale behind with the bundle of nuts tied to her back. After she started on her way, she put her hands behind her back, opened the bundle and allowed the kukui nuts to drop on the road. When they arrived at the house all the nuts were gone. Upon being questioned: “Say, Lipewale, what has become of your kukui nuts?” She answered: “You fixed the bundle and I put it on my back and followed behind you. I have no eyes at my back to see whether the nuts were falling out of the bundle or not.” After this Kahalaokolepuupuu said to Lipewale: “You will have to stay home and print my pa-u while the rest of us go down and have a sea bath.” Lipewale was therefore left behind to print the pa-u. She first went out and got some filth and came back and proceeded to carry out the order by smearing the bambu sticks lengthwise and crosswise and began the printing of the pa-u. This did not take very long, so she followed along behind the others and went in sea bathing. On the way down to the sea, she caused herself to be transformed back to her usual self and she again possessed all her beauty. She continued on down and when she was near the others she passed on by and bathed at some distance from them. When she was finished she went right along up home. When the others saw her returning home they chased on behind, but they could not catch up and she arrived at home some time before the others, when she was once more transformed into the form of an old woman. When the others arrived at home, they asked her: “Say, did you see a beautiful woman who came up this way from below?” “No, I have not seen her. I have been sitting out here all this time until you returned.” After the others had gone to the dancing house she remained with her brother Kahikiula. She went outside of the house and called out:"

A ua hele lakou e kaapuni ma ka aina a puni, aole mea aa mai ia lakou. Ia lakou e kaapuni ana i ka aina o Kuaihelani, kaulana aku la ka ikaika o Kealohikikaupea, no Kauai ia kanaka.

A hiki lakou i Oahu nei, hakoko iho la lakou, hookahi no puupuu, waiho ana ua mau kanaka ala o Oahu nei i lalo, a haalele iho la lakou. Hele lakou a Maui, e noho ana o Kakaalaneo ke ’lii o Maui, hakoko no make no ia lakou nei.","The main pastime indulged in by the brothers of Aukelenuiaiku was wrestling, boxing and other manly games that were known at that time. In these games they became famous in all the land of Kuaihelani as being the strongest, and furthermore, these boys went around the whole country without being beaten. On one of the trips around Kuaihelani the fame and the strength of Kealohikikaupea, a strong man of Kauai, reached these boys. The main deed of strength participated in by this man which made him famous was the great ease he had in breaking a man in two. When the boys from Kuaihelani arrived in Kauai, one of them met this strong man and with one blow laid him low. They then made a complete circuit of Kauai without meeting [ ] any challenger. While they were in Kauai word came to them of three strong men on Oahu. Their names were, Kaikipaananea, Kupukupukehaikalani and Kupukupukehaiiaku. There were none stronger than these three men. Upon the arrival of the champions of Kuaihelani on Oahu they met in contest, and with one blow the said men of Oahu were defeated, after which the Kuaihelani champions left Oahu and went to Maui. Kakaalaneo was the king of Maui at this time, and in a contest he was vanquished by them."
"Ia lakou ma Maui e kaapuni ana, kaulana mai la o Kepakailiula i ka ikaika a me ke koa, e hiki ia ia e haihai i ke kanaka, a oia ka oi o Hawaii a puni. A lohe lakou i kona kaulana i ka ikaika, makau iho la lakou a hoi mai la i Kuaihelani.

No ka mea, o Aukelenuiaiku, ua paa loa ia i ka palama ia i ko lakou makuakane e Iku, ma ke ano kapu alii, a me ka punahele loa.","While the Kuaihelani champions were making a circuit of Maui the fame of Kepakailiula for his great strength and daring came to them. It was said that he could break [in pieces] any man who opposed him, and he was the greatest warrior of the whole island of Hawaii. When the Kuaihelani champions heard of the feats of strength performed by Kepakailiula, they became afraid and returned to Kuaihelani. Upon their arrival at their home in Kuaihelani they gave exhibitions of all the sporting games known to them, such as wrestling, boxing, to wrestle on all fours, to hide a pebble under piles of kapas, to dance, to roll the stone disk, to jump from high cliffs into the water, to make the spear glide, and various other games. In getting up these games they were instigated by the desire of drawing their youngest brother to them, when they would kill him, for Aukelenuiaiku was kept under Iku’s fostering care all the time, and was accorded all the honors due to a king, and was jealously guarded."
"Ma keia noho kapu ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua lohe ia aku la ka pihe uwa a na kaikuaana ona, e lealea ana, alaila, ninau aku la o Aukelenuiaiku ia Iku, ko lakou makuakane: “He pihe aha keia o kai e uwa nei?” Hai aku ka makuakane: “He hakoko.” “Pehea ia mea?” “Elua kanaka, ku i luna, kulai kekahi i kekahi, a hina kekahi, alaila, uwa ka aha. Oia kela pihe au e lohe la i ka uwauwa mai.” Alaila, i aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Makemake wale.” Pela no o Aukelenuiaiku i ninaninau mau ai i ko lakou makuakane. Alaila nonoi aku la ia e iho e nana. Hoole mai ko lakou makuakane: “Aole oe e iho.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku : “No ke aha hoi?” I mai ka makuakane: “Mamuli oe make i ou mau kaikuaana, no ka mea, ua hoomauhala ou kaikuaana ia oe e noho nei.” Ninau aku la o Aukelenuiaiku : “Heaha ka hala i hoomau ai?” I aku ka makuakane: “He hala, oia kuu hooili ana i ke kapu nou a me ke aupuni; nolaila mai iho oe, o make auanei i ou mau kaikuaana.”","While Aukelenuiaiku was thus guarded, he one day heard the yells and shouts of the people who were gathered at the games being held by his brothers, so Aukelenuiaiku asked of Iku his father: “What is the cause of the shouting down below?” The father replied: “They are holding some wrestling matches.” “How is that game played?” “It is played by two persons. They stand up facing each other and each one tries to throw the other one down to the ground. When one is thrown the people would shout, expressing their joy. That is the cause of the shouting that you hear.” Aukelenuiaiku then said: “How I wish to see it!” He therefore questioned his father relating to the various games. After hearing how they were played, he asked that he be allowed to go down and look on, but his father refused, saying: “You cannot go down.” Aukelenuiaiku then asked him: “Why not?” The father replied: “You will be killed by your brothers, for they hate you.” Aukelenuiaiku then further asked his father: “What is the cause of the hatred?” The father replied: “There is a reason. It is because I have given you all the honors and the kingdom. Therefore you must not go down, for if you do you will be killed by your brothers.”"
"A hala he anahulu, alaila, lohe hou ia mai la ka pihe uwa hou, aole o Aukelenuiaiku i hai aku i ko lakou makuakane, no keia leo uwa hou.

Ua like kona ili me ka maia pala memele, a o kona mau onohi maka me he opuu maia la o ka hua ana o ka wa hou, a he pololei hoi kona kino, aohe puu, aohe kee, aohe ona mea e like ai.","After ten days had gone by the shouting and yelling at the games were again heard, but Aukelenuiaiku did not let his father know of the renewal of the games. He then got up and secretly went down to look at the games, without the knowledge of his father. In going Aukelenuiaiku took an arrow with him. When Aukelenuiaiku arrived near the house where his brothers were holding the games, he shot the arrow into the building. On the arrow entering the building, the brothers took it up and said: [ ] “How strange! our arrows are in joints, but this one is twisted!” While they were discussing the matter one of them took it and after looking it over said: “This is not a stranger’s arrow; this is the arrow belonging to our brother Aukelenuiaiku.” While this brother was saying this, Kekamakahinuiaiku, he of the bad temper, took it and broke it into pieces. Shortly after this Aukelenuiaiku approached the building and stood on the outside of the wall which surrounded the building. While Aukelenuiaiku was standing there, all the brothers looked at him. They marveled at his handsome appearance: his skin was like the ripe banana and his eyeballs were like the bud of a banana at its first appearance; his body was straight and faultless, and he was without equal."

Uwa ae la na kanaka.","When the people who were gathered there saw Aukelenuiaiku, they expressed words of praise at his great comeliness. While the people were praising Aukelenuiaiku, the oldest brother became very angry and his face changed. He then sent out one of his younger brothers to go and ask Aukelenuiaiku the reason of his coming. The name of the brother that was sent was Kuaiku. When he had come into the presence of Aukelenuiaiku, he asked him: “What has brought you here?” Aukelenuiaiku answered: “To enjoy the games.” Kuaiku returned to their angry brother and told him. When he heard this, he again sent Kuaiku, saying: “Go and strike him once.” When Kuaiku came up to Aukelenuiaiku, he struck at him, but he did not knock him down nor did he hurt him. On the first blow he broke his own right arm, then he tried his left and that too was broken. When Kuaiku saw that his two arms were broken he turned to proceed back to the house. At this Aukelenuiaiku reached out and took hold of his brother by the arms, bundled him up, and threw him to the edge of the sea. When the people saw the great strength of Aukelenuiaiku, they gave a mighty shout, and said: “That is the only man that has been able to throw and break the arms of Kuaiku.” After this another of the brothers came out with the intention of killing Aukelenuiaiku. This brother was the greatest wrestler and could break a man in arms; but when he met Aukelenuiaiku, he was unable to throw him down or hurt him. When he found that he was unable to throw Aukelenuiaiku, he turned with the intention of going back to the house, but Aukelenuiaiku reached out, held him up and threw him into the sea. This made the people shout again."

When this brother saw that all his younger brothers had been defeated by Aukelenuiaiku he went up full of anger, bent on throwing Aukelenuiaiku into the sea, but in this he proved a failure, for his youngest brother overmatched him. While they were fighting and pushing each other, Aukelenuiaiku held his ground so well that the oldest brother became exhausted, and in time gave up all idea of fighting, and he left Aukelenuiaiku and turned with the intention of going back to the house. At this Aukelenuiaiku reached out, took hold of him, and threw him bodily into the sea. When he dropped [ ] into the sea his desire of killing Aukelenuiaiku vanished and he began to show signs of regret and pretended to be friendly. When he came up to Aukelenuiaiku he said: “Let us cease the conflict and all hatred and let us be friends, since this is only a fight between brothers.” He then invited Aukelenuiaiku to go to the house, which invitation was accepted by Aukelenuiaiku, believing it to be sincere. When they entered the house the oldest brother uncovered the deep pit of Kamooinanea, and took hold of Aukelenuiaiku and threw him down into it, where the brothers thought Aukelenuiaiku would die."
"A haule o Aukelenuiaiku i lalo o ka lua, aia hoi, elua kanaka e noho ana. Mamua o ko Aukelenuiaiku haule ana, ko laua haule ana i lalo o ka lua. Na ua poe kaikuaana la no o Aukelenuiaiku i kiola.

When the two men saw Aukelenuiaiku, they took pity on him because he was so handsome and pleasant to look upon, having a perfect physique, and being without blemish. While the two were talking together, Aukelenuiaiku heard them and so he asked them: “What are you two talking about?” They answered: “We are expressing our regrets because we pity you.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this he asked them: “And why?” The men replied: “Because of the death by the great lizard, Kamooinanea.” Aukelenuiaiku again asked: “When will the lizard come forth?” The men replied: “When the tide rises and falls, then rises and falls again, and when it comes up the third time, then the lizard comes up with it; then we will all be killed.”"
"A pau ka olelo ana a laua ia Aukelenuiaiku, mahope o laila, pii mai la ua moo nei o Kamooinanea, a kahea mai la: “E, Aukelenuiaiku e! homai oe i kekahi [ ] kanaka i mea ai na’u.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Haawi aku auanei au ia oe, i aha hoi ko’u hoanoho o keia wahi mehameha?” Alaila, nalowale aku la ua moo nei mai ko lakou mau maka aku.

When they saw the lizard and how terrible it looked they were sore afraid, and the two men began to show signs of uneasiness. After the lizard had disappeared from their sight, the men said to Aukelenuiaiku: “How wonderful! here this lizard is acquainted [ ] with your name. This is the first time that the lizard has not come and devoured its prey outright. We were told that immediately the lizard made its appearance , it would come and devour its victims; but here we see that we are safe for a time. Should it disappear altogether, we will escape death.”"
"Olelo mai la ua moo nei ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E kii oe i elua lau ape.” A loaa na lau ape ia Aukelenuiaiku, lawe aku la ia i mua o ua moo nei, a luai iho la ua moo nei i luna o na lau ape elua, a piha ae la. I aku la ia ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E ka moopuna, e nana oe.” Nana iho la o Aukelenuiaiku. Alaila, i mai la ua moo nei: “He mau aina keia e ku nei i loko o ka lau ape, he aina nui, he aina uuku, he aina mahana, he aina wela, he aina anu.

Mai keia wahi a’u e olelo nei ia oe, malaila oe e hele ai.”","The lizard then said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Go and bring me two ape leaves.” When Aukelenuiaiku returned with the ape leaves he placed them in front of the lizard. The lizard then vomited onto the two leaves until they were covered over, and then it said to Aukelenuiaiku: “My grandson, look on these two leaves.” Aukelenuiaiku obeyed and looked on. The lizard then continued: “Here are two lands on these two ape leaves, a large land and a small land; a warm and hot land, and a cold land. These two lands, however, Holaniku and Holanimoe, are very beautiful lands and they possess everything necessary for the comfort of mankind; they possess food, fish, sugar-cane, potatoes, bananas, awa, breadfruit and all other things good to eat. Where I direct you there you must go.”"
"A pau nei mau olelo a ua moo la ia Aukelenuiaiku, i aku la ia: “E moe i lalo.” Moe iho la o Aukelenuiaiku i lalo, paa aku la ua moo nei ma ka puhaka o ka moopuna: “E kuu moopuna, ou kaikuaana, e pau ana lakou i ka make ia oe, a e lilo ana oe i alii maluna o lakou, no ka mea, ua hana ino lakou ia oe.” Hai hou aku la no ua moo nei, i kana moopuna ia Aukelenuiaiku: “O keia aina nae, eono malama e malamalama ai, a eono malama e pouli ai; mai hele oe malaila o make oe, no ka mea, mamua aku o keia wahi, he kai omaomao, a hala ia, he kai ulaula aku, mai hele oe malaila o make oe.

The lizard then held her grandson by the waist and said: “My grandson, you will yet be the cause of the death of your older brothers, and shall be king over them all; because they have ill-treated you.” The lizard then continued, saying: “This land, however,” pointing to one, “during six months is lighted and during six months it is in darkness; don’t go there, for you will be killed: because, before you come to this land you will have to cross a green sea; after that is passed, you will come to a red sea; don’t go there, for you will get killed; because in the days before I was married I traveled over this land, and now I am old, yet I have not completed its entire circuit. The name of this land is Kalakeenuiakane (Asia, according to the foreigners). The mountains are so high that the stars [ ] appear on them, and there are very few people living on it. The owner of the land is Namakaokahai, a chiefess, and she has four brothers: Kanemoe, Kaneikaapua, Leapua and Kahaumana. She has two servants, Upoho and Haapuainanea. Those who guard and watch over the land are Moela, a dog, and three birds, Manuea, Kiwaha and Halulu. These are all the people who live on the land; there are not many, because the people are devoured by the ghosts.”"
"Ma keia nalowale ana o Aukelenuiaiku, ua nui ke aloha o ko lakou makuakane nona, a ua kanikau ia me ke aloha i na la a pau loa, a ua hookeai a ua hoohiki iho oia aole e ai i ka ai a make ia, no ka minamina ia Aukelenuiaiku.

Because of his great grief he refused to take food. After suffering for days he expressed a wish to die. But the mother of Aukelenuiaiku did not think that her son was dead, and she refused to listen to her husband, to fast and to mourn for their son. She was certain that Aukelenuiaiku was not dead, and that her lizard mother, Kamooinanea, had not devoured him. In discussing with her husband as to the prospects of their son being eaten up by the lizard she said: “If she has eaten him, who is my own issue, then she should have eaten me up first, and after that, my son. I tell you now that Aukelenuiaiku is there down below being educated by his grandmother in all things, and he is not dead. He will yet return to us here above.” These words of the wife all came true."
"A pau na mea a pau loa i ka loaa ia Aukelenuiaiku, ia wa, kau ae la o Aukelenuiaiku i luna o ka moo, hapai ae la ia ia Aukelenuiaiku a kau i luna o ka lua, a hoi aku la ka moo i lalo o ka lua.

[ ]",After all the various things had been mastered by Aukelenuiaiku he then climbed onto the back of the lizard and was lifted up out of the pit; and the lizard again disappeared down the pit. Aukelenuiaiku then took up the box that contained his god together with his club and carried them as he returned to the house. When Aukelenuiaiku reached the house his father and all the chiefs wept for joy. [ ]

While Aukelenuiaiku was weeping with his parents, his brothers, who were out surf riding, heard the wailing and so asked: “For whom is this wailing going on?” “It is Aukelenuiaiku.” When the brothers heard that the wailing was because of the return of Aukelenuiaiku they were so ashamed that they concluded they would build them a ship and go to some foreign land. They then rode in on the surf and proceeded direct to the forest. After they had been in the forest for over two months, Aukelenuiaiku one day went up into the forest to catch him some birds. After he had caught and cleaned several birds he started a fire and then put them on the coals to roast. After the birds were cooked he sat down to his meal, and, while he was eating, his brothers came upon him and took away all the birds, leaving him nothing. After this the oldest brother, he with the violent temper, ordered Aukelenuiaiku to go and bring them some water. While Aukelenuiaiku was on his way for water he got up and followed him. While Aukelenuiaiku was busy filling the calabash with water the angry brother arrived and replaced the rock on the mouth of the water hole, shutting in Aukelenuiaiku and left him there to die."
"A mahope o keia uwe ana, pii aku la o Ikumailani e huli. Mamua ae o kona pii ana, olelo aku ko lakou makuakane ia ia: “I pii oe a loaa ko kaikaina, e hoihoi mai oe a hiki i ka hale nei.” Mamua ae o ka pii ana o Ikumailani, olelo aku ia i ko lakou makuakane: “E! ke pii nei au, i nana ae oe a i a ke ahi, ua loaa ko keiki, a i a ole mai, aole i loaa ia’u.” A pau kana kamailio ana, pii aku la o Ikumailani e huli.

A pau ko laua uwe ana, ho-a ae la o Ikumailani i ke ahi, a ike mai la ko lakou makuakane, manao iho la ia, ua loaa o Aukelenuiaiku, aole i make.","After this weeping Ikumailani again proceeded up the forest in search of his brother. Before starting upon his mission their father said to him: “In case you should find your brother, bring him home here.” Before Ikumailani set out he said to their father: “I am going up; if you look and see a fire, remember I have found your son; but in case you don’t see a fire, then I have not found him.” After saying this, Ikumailani started out on his search. When he came up to the water hole he looked and saw that the mouth had been covered with a large rock. He then rolled away the rock and looked down into the hole, and saw Aukelenuiaiku standing there, thin and weak, having only enough strength left to be able to stand. Ikumailani then reached down for his brother and lifted him up; they then kissed each other and wept. After their weeping, Ikumailani started a fire, which was seen by their father, and he knew that Aukelenuiaiku had been found and that he was not dead."
"A makaukau ka holo o ka moku, ninau aku la o Aukelenuiaiku i kona kaikuaana oluolu ia Ikumailani: “E holo ana ko oukou moku i hea?” “I ka imi aina.” Wahi a Aukelenuiaiku: “A i aha ia no ka hoi keia aina?” I mai o Ikumailani: “Ua hilahila ke kaikuaana o kakou i ko ola hou ana mai nei, nolaila keia holo o ka moku e imi aina. A loaa ka aina ia makou, maloko o ka ikaika, alaila, o ko makou aina ia e noho ai.”","After all the preparations for the sailing had been completed, Aukelenuiaiku asked of Ikumailani, the brother who had shown him some love: “Where is your ship sailing for?” “In search of land.” Aukelenuiaiku again asked: “And what is the matter with this land?” Ikumailani replied: “Our oldest brother is ashamed, because of your return. That is the reason why the ship is about to sail off in search of some land. After a [new] land is conquered through our strength, that will be our place to dwell.”"
"A lohe o Aukelenuiaiku i ko lakou holo, nonoi aku la ia; “Owau kekahi e holo me oukou.” Olelo mai kona kaikuaana o Ikumailani: “Aole oe e holo me makou, no ka mea, aohe o makou kumu e ae o ka holo, o oe wale no.

Nolaila, ke nonoi aku nei au, owau kekahi e holo me oukou, i make oukou ko’u poe kaikuaana, alaila, make pu aku wau. Alaila, kaulana ka inoa i hope nei, ‘O mea ma, make pu no me ko lakou pokii.’ Nolaila, aole e waia ka inoa mahope nei.”","When Aukelenuiaiku heard the object of the sailing of the ship, he begged that he too be allowed to sail with them. His brother Ikumailani then said to him: “You cannot go with us, because we have no other reason of going away except on your own account. If you had died we would not be leaving Kuaihelani.” By this refusal on the part of his brother, Aukelenuiaiku said in kindly reply: “Say, don’t you know that it is a sad thing to go off to some strange land and die there. Your bones will be put away by a stranger, perhaps even by a friend, but not by a younger brother, one who has been born with you and who was from the same womb. I therefore beg of you that I too be allowed to sail with you, so that in case you my older brothers should die, then I will die with you. Then our names will come back in fame in the saying, ‘So-and-so have died with their younger brother.’ Then your names will not be spoken in disrespect.”"
"Ma keia mau olelo a kakou e lohe nei, he mea e ko Aukelenuiaiku imi hala, a, hilahila ole no hoi, me kona ike pono iho no, na kona mau kaikuaana kona pilikia. O ka mea aiwa loa aku ka ia i ka hahai e hoomano ai. Nolaila, ina he oiaio na ko Aukelenuiaiku waha ponoi keia, ua ae ia kona mau poino, a ua pono no ia ke make.

A ua hooko ia hoi kana mau olelo wanana no Aukelenuiaiku, ma keia holo ana o ka moku.","By these remarks we see how determined Aukelenuiaiku was in trying to follow his brothers, when he knew that all his troubles had come from these same men. With all this he still wished and insisted on going with them. If this is so, then we cannot blame the older brothers if they should kill him. In this request, that he be allowed to accompany them, however, we will see how he for a time managed to save his brothers from death, and how he came to have all the benefits foretold him by his lizard grandmother; and how all the advice she gave Aukelenuiaiku was faithfully kept to his salvation."
"A pau ka Aukelenuiaiku olelo ana, i mai kona kaikuaana oluolu, o Ikumailani: “Aole oe e holo ia’u, aka, e hele oe a ke keiki a kakou olelo aku, a i ae mai, alaila oe holo.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Pehea auanei au e olelo aku ai e hoolohe mai ai kela [ ] ia’u?” “E hele oe a kahea aku ma kona inoa ponoi, penei: ‘E Kaumailunaoh olaniku e! e kahea mai oe ia’u e pii aku kaua i luna o ka moku, e lealea ai kaua, e paani ai, aole oe e kohu me keia poe elemakule, owau kou hoa e kohu ai, he kamalii, he kamalii.’ ” A pau ke aoao ana a kona kaikuaana ia ia, olelo mai ko lakou makuakane ia ia: “E kuu keiki, mai hele oe, o make hou oe.

You must go to our nephew and tell him of your wish. If he gives his consent, then you will be able to go.” Aukelenuiaiku [ ] then asked him: “How am I to get him to listen to me?” “You go and call him by his name in this way: ‘Say, Kaumailunaoholaniku, ask me to come up on the ship with you so that we may play together. You cannot enjoy yourself with those old men. I am the proper companion that will be suited to you, because you are young and so am I.’ ” After these instructions had been imparted by his older brother, their father who was listening said: “My boy, don’t go with them, for you will be killed. When you are not safe living with me, what chance will you have when you accompany them? If you insist on going you will surely get killed, and your mother and I will not see you again.” Aukelenuiaiku answered: “I will not remain with you two. I am going sightseeing and to visit other lands in the sea; therefore I am going.”"

Oia wale no ka leo oi.","After the above conversation, Aukelenuiaiku proceeded to the ship with Ikumailani his brother. When they arrived at the ship, his brother went aboard, leaving Aukelenuiaiku below on the landing. Aukelenuiaiku then called out to his nephew, and after telling him what he wanted, he was invited by the nephew to come aboard in the following words: “My uncle, come aboard of the vessel.” Upon receiving this invitation, Aukelenuiaiku climbed aboard, while his older brothers looked on, for they dared not deny their nephew his wish. The boy was their great favorite; whatever he said was law with them, and all the uncles obeyed his every word. This boy was raised under a very strict kapu; and if he ordered that a person be killed, that person is killed; if he ordered that a person be allowed to go free, that person goes off free. Therefore this boy’s person was sacred, and whatever he said was law; nothing was denied him, and no one dared say nay to him. They all obeyed him."

When the boy heard this, he sent a couple of men after these things. After the men had returned with these things, the ship started off on its voyage from Kuaihelani. In the first four months of the voyage their food, meat and water, were exhausted and the men began to die of hunger and thirst, and the brothers were in great distress. When the brothers found that all their food was exhausted, they went down into the body of the ship and stayed there, while Aukelenuiaiku and the boy stayed above. After several days had gone by, the boy began to wonder at the disappearance of his father and uncles, so he went down into the ship to look for them. When he got to the bottom of the vessel he found his father and uncles lying weak from hunger. The boy then climbed onto the breast of his father, Kekamakahinuiaiku, the one with the violent temper, and who hated Aukelenuiaiku most of all. As the boy sat on his father’s chest, the father looked up and when he saw his son he said: “Yes, how pitiful! I have no regrets as far as we are concerned, for we have spent many days in this world; but it is you that I pity, for all the food, the meat and water are gone, and all that is left is two joints of sugar-cane.” The boy replied: “I am not distressed, for I am not in need of food, for my uncle has a certain leaf which we touch to our lips and our hunger is satisfied, and we stay without wanting any food for four months.” After talking with his father for a while, he returned to his uncle, Aukelenuiaiku, [ ] with tears in his eyes. When the uncle saw that the boy was crying, he asked him: “What are you weeping for? Why these tears that you are shedding?” The boy replied: “I am weeping for my father, Kekamakahinuiaiku, who is almost dead of hunger. When I reached him he was gasping for breath.” Aukelenuiaiku then said to the boy: “My boy, you too would have died with your father and uncles in this ocean if I had not come along with you. I am hated by your father as his most bitter enemy, but according to our birth by our parents, I will not act as they have toward me. Therefore, my boy, here is the food, the meat, and the water in this club of ours (the name of this club was Kaiwakaapu); take it and open one end of the club, and the food, the meat, the kapa and everything else will come out of their own accord.” The boy then followed the direction of his uncle, Aukelenuiaiku, and all the things necessary for their comfort were furnished them. The father and uncles and those of the ship ate and were saved. Their faintness from hunger disappeared as well as their weakness."
"A pau na malama eha ma keia holo ana i ka moana, hoomaka ka la mua o ka lima o ka malama. Ia wa, hai aku o Aukelenuiaiku i kona ike i na kaikuaana, a me na kanaka a pau o luna o ka moku: “Apopo ike kakou i ka aina, a ku no ia la, o ka inoa o ua aina ala o Holaniku. He nui na me ai o ia aina, ka ai, ka awa, ke ko, ka maia, ka niu, a me na mea a pau loa.”","After they were saved from death, the ship sailed on for another four months; but the food and water were so plentiful that they wasted a lot. But other things were also furnished them by the club of Aukelenuiaiku. At the end of the second four months and they had entered into the first day of the fifth month, Aukelenuiaiku told his older brothers as well as to the other men on board the ship, saying: “Tomorrow we will see land and shall go ashore the same day. The name of the land is Holaniku. The land contains many things that are good to eat: food, awa, sugar cane, bananas, coconuts and various other things.”"
"A hala ka la ana i hoakaka ai, hiki mai ka lua o ka la, o ia kana la i olelo ai e ku i ka aina o Holaniku. I ke kakahiaka nui, ike mua ia mai la ke kuahiwi o ka aina, a awakea, ku lakou i ka aina.

As soon as the ship touched land the men went ashore where they found food, water, meat, awa and various other things. They stayed on the land for four days and four nights, when they again boarded their ship and set sail. After sailing for four months, Aukelenuiaiku said to his brothers: “Tomorrow we will reach land.” When his brothers heard this, they said: “You are deceiving us.” But there was none of them who could deny the fact, for Aukelenuiaiku showed that he knew what he was talking about; so the sailing masters all admitted that Aukelenuiaiku was correct. But the brothers being bitter against Aukelenuiaiku, refused to believe him."
"A kokoke mai la ka la a Aukelenuiaiku i olelo ai, ike aku la lakou i ka aina o Kalakeenuiakane. Ma ia la a po, a ao, a kakahiaka ku lakou i ka aina. O ke ’lii o ua aina ala he wahine, o Namakaokahai ka inoa.","On the approach of the next day, the day Aukelenuiaiku had predicted they would see land, the voyagers saw land, the land of Kalakeenuiakane; and it took all that day and night until the morning of the next day before they reached shore. The land was ruled by a queen, called Namakaokahai."
"I aku o Aukelenuiaiku i na kaikuaana: “Ia’u ka olelo o ka moku o kakou.” I mai na kaikuaana: “Aole no hoi e kapili i moku nou, alaila no hoi olelo.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Ina ia’u ka olelo o ka moku, ola kakou, ina ia oukou, make kakou, [ ] aole e ola.” Olelo mai na kaikuaana ia Aukelenuiaiku: “Ihea la kau ao ana i neia mea he ikaika a me ke koa, i olelo ai oe maluna o makou e noho malie, a o oe ka waha olelo.” “He oiaio ia, ina he kaua ma ka lima, a ma ke alo, alaila, na oukou ka eha a me ka make; aka, ina he kaua poipu, aole e loaa ia oukou, nolaila au i olelo ai, e make ana kakou.” I mai na kaikuaana: “Aole no au olelo no keia mau mea a pau loa, aia no i ko makou manao, e noho malie no oe.” Ma kea mau olelo a kona mau kaikuaana, noho malie iho la o Aukelenuiaiku, aohe olelo aku.","When they touched land Aukelenuiaiku said to his brothers: “Let me have charge of the ship?” The brothers said: “Why don’t you build yourself a ship, then you can have all the say.” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “If I have charge of the ship we will all be saved, but if you insist on taking charge of it yourself we will all be killed, [ ] none will be saved.” The brothers replied to Aukelenuiaiku, saying: “Where did you learn to be strong and brave, so that you could have the right to tell us to hold our peace while you take charge of everything.” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “It would be quite right if it were to be a hand to hand fight, where you could meet your enemy face to face. There would be no doubt then, for you would surely win, but if the fight is to be otherwise, you will not win. This is the reason why I said that we will all be killed.” The brothers said: “You have nothing to say in the matter, anyhow. It is going to be as we wish it, and you must keep quiet.” When the brothers said this, Aukelenuiaiku did not make any reply."

She then sent her brothers, the four birds, to fly to the ship and inquire the object of its coming. The names of these brothers of Namakaokahai, were Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana. The brothers then flew in their bird form and lit on the yards and asked: “What is the object of this ship coming here?” The brothers answered: “It is a ship to make war.” When the birds heard this they returned to Namakaokahai. When they arrived they were asked: “What is that ship here for?” “It is a ship to make war.” When Namakaokahai heard this, she came and stood on the outside of the house, and girded on her war pau while she held her war kahili in her hand."
"Aka, mamua ae o ka lohe ana o Namakaokahai i na kaikunane manu ona, olelo aku o Aukelenuiaiku i na kaikuaana ona: “E! auhea oukou, i hele hou mai na manu e ninau i ka moku nei, e hai aku oukou, he moku makaikai keia, aohe moku kaua.” Ia Aukelenuiaiku e olelo ana, hiki mai la na manu i ka moku, a ninau hou mai la: “Heaha ka hana a keia moku o ka holo ana mai i anei?” I aku na kaikuaana o Aukelenuiaiku: “He moku kaua.”","Before Namakaokahai received her brothers’ report, Aukelenuiaiku said to them: “Say, where are you all? The birds are coming back and will again inquire of the object of our coming. When they arrive, you tell them that the ship is only on a voyage of sightseeing, and not a ship to make war.” While Aukelenuiaiku was still talking the birds arrived on the ship and again asked: “What is the object of the coming of this ship?” The brothers of Aukelenuiaiku replied: “It is a ship to make war.”"

As the box struck the water, Aukelenuiaiku jumped in after it and taking hold of it he swam away from the ship. While Aukelenuiaiku was swimming the nephew called out after him, but Aukelenuiaiku replied: “You cannot follow me, you had better remain where you are.” While he was speaking to his nephew, Namakaokahai arrived at the seashore, took hold of her war pau and turned it to her rear, then she next took up her kahili and shook it in the air. [ ] No sooner than this was done, the ship together with the brothers of Aukelenuiaiku were turned into ashes. When Aukelenuiaiku looked behind him after swimming for some distance, he saw that the ship had disappeared, so he turned and swam with his box toward land."

And in the coming conflict we will see how Aukelenuiaiku and his god fought their battle, and how Namakaokahai became the wife of Aukelenuiaiku."

He then crawled under an ekoko tree and slept, for he was completely used up by his efforts to reach the shore. While Aukelenuiaiku was sleeping, Moela arrived, the dog who had the watching of all the land, and when he smelled the blood of the stranger he began to bark. While the dog was barking, Namakaokahai came out of the house and called out to her four bird brothers. When they came before her, she said: “You must go in search of this thing that the dog is barking at; it is possible that one of the men from the ship has come ashore. I cannot make out what the dog is barking at.” The brothers replied: “Send your two maid servants.” At this the queen was satisfied; so she called for her two maid servants, Upoho and Haapuainanea. When they came in the presence of the queen, she said to them: “I want you to go in search of the thing the dog is barking at. If you two should find it, kill it.”"

Mahope o keia ala ana o Aukelenuiaiku, aoao aku o Lonoikoualii ia ia, penei: “Ina i hiki mai na wahine elua, he mau wahine maikai, o ko laua mau ano nae, he moo, he iole, o Upoho ka iole, o Haapuainanea ka moo. A hiki mai laua, e waiho aku oe i mua o laua i ke aloha o keia aina, penei: ‘E walina hoi ia oe e Upoho, e walina hoi ia oe e Haapuainanea,’ na laua ia e hilahila ia oe, i ka loaa mua o ko laua inoa, alaila, ola oe.”","When they left to make their search, Lonoikoualii, the god of Aukelenuiaiku, said to him: “Here comes our death, they are coming in search of you, therefore you must get up.” Aukelenuiaiku then woke up and put on his war dress of ashes. As soon as this was done, Lonoikoualii began to direct him what to do in the following words: “When the two women arrive, who are very comely, although they will be in the form of a lizard and a rat, Upoho being the rat and Haapuainanea the lizard, you must greet them in the following manner: ‘My greetings to you, Upoho; and my greetings to you, Haapuainanea.’ That will shame them, because you have been able to discover their names; then you will be saved.”"
"A pau ka olelo ana a Lonoikoualii ia Aukelenuiaiku, hiki mai la o Upoho, a me Haapuainanea. Ia laua e hele mai ana, waiho mua aku o Aukelenuiaiku i ke aloha ia laua: “E walina ia oe e Upoho, e walina ia oe e Haapuainanea.” A lohe laua i ka leo aloha o Aukelenuiaiku, hilahila iho la laua, no ka loaa o ko laua inoa ia ia.

[ ]","At the close of these instructions from the god Lonoikoualii, Upoho and Haapuainanea arrived. While they were approaching the place, Aukelenuiaiku greeted them, saying: “My greetings to you, Upoho; and my greetings to you, Haapuainanea.” When the two women heard the greeting from Aukelenuiaiku, they were ashamed, because their names were known to this stranger. Upoho then asked of Haapuainanea: “What must we give in payment to this person who has called us by our right names?” The other replied: “Let us be friends.” Upoho assented to this, and they came and sat on either side of Aukelenuiaiku. [ ]"
"A launa ae la lakou nei ekolu, elua wahine, hookahi kane, o Aukelenuiaiku, a pau ka lakou mau olelo hoinainau, haule iho la lakou konane. Olelo aku o Aukelenuiaiku i na wahine:","After the three had become friends, the two women and Aukelenuiaiku, they began to converse of various matters and after a while a game of konane was proposed and played. Aukelenuiaiku then said to the women:"
"“O ke kui keia, o ka holo kela, Moe kawa, hapala ka ele, Na ke kea ka ai, Ku ka ehu o na waa liilii, I ke keiki o Kuaihelani.”","“This my turn; now it is your turn. Now we pause, the blacks cannot move, And the whites have won. The small canoes are as but dust, To the boy from Kuaihelani.”"
"A pau ka nanea ana, olelo aku na wahine ia Aukelenuiaiku: “I hoouna ia mai nei maua e make oe, no ka mea, ua ike ia oe e ka ilio a ke ’lii wahine o makou, e Moela; aka, e hoi ana maua a hoole aku, aole i loaa ia maua, a nana ia e hoouna mai i luna hou.”","After playing for a while, the women said to Aukelenuiaiku: “We have been sent to kill you, for you were discovered by the dog of our queen, Moela; but we are going back and report that we have failed to find the person the dog was barking at, and it will be for her to send some other officers.”"
"A hiki laua i mua o ke ’lii wahine, o Namakaokahai, ninau mai la ia: “Auhea ka olua mea i huli aku nei?” I aku na wahine: “Aole i loaa ia maua, a luna maua o ka pali a me ka laau, aohe loaa iki, a uka maua, a kai maua, aohe loaa iki.” Wahi a laua ia Namakaokahai: “Ua kuhihewa paha ka ilio, i ka hohono o ke koko i luna o ka mea ae kai, he kanaka, nolaila, hae.” Ia laua e olelo ana, kuu hou ae la ke ’lii wahine i ka ilio ana, ia Moela.

We went to the top of the cliff, and on the top of the trees, and we were unable to discover anybody. We went to the uplands and shorewards, but again we failed to find anyone.” The women then continued: “Perhaps the dog was mistaken and had smelled the blood of those that were slain; and because of that he barked.” While the two were making their report the queen again released her dog, Moela. As soon as this was done the dog began to bark again and he continued to do this for some time. When the queen saw this she sent for her four bird brothers, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana to come to her. When they came in the presence of the queen, she said to them: “I want you to go in search for the person that Moela is barking at. It may be a man, may be not; what is it?” As soon as she had issued her orders, the four birds flew away. When the birds were getting ready to make their flight, Lonoikoualii said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, here comes our death. There are four birds coming to meet us. You must greet them in the same way that you greeted the two women.”"
"A hiki lakou i mua o Aukelenuiaiku, kahea mai la o Aukelenuiaiku me ka leo aloha, penei: “E walina ia oe e Kanemoe; e walina ia oe e Kaneapua; E walina ia oe e Leapua; e walina ia oe e Kahaumana.” Aloha mai la no hoi lakou ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E walina hoi oe.” Mahope o ke aloha ana mai a Aukelenuiaiku ia lakou, kamailio malu iho la lakou no ka loaa o ko lakou inoa, olelo ae la o Kanemoe: “Kupanaha! i hea la kahi i loaa ai o ko kakou inoa ia ia, a i aha la auanei ka kakou uku ia ia.” I mai la kekahi: “Hookahi no a kakou uku ia ia, o ke kaikuahine o kakou, i wahine nana, alaila, o ko kakou kaikoeke keia.” Ae mai la ko lakou nui, [ ] alaila, olelo aku la lakou i keia mau olelo ia Aukelenuiaiku, a he mea oluolu loa ia i ko Aukelenuiaiku manao.","When the birds arrived in the presence of Aukelenuiaiku, he greeted them one by one saying: “My greetings to you, Kanemoe. My greetings to you, Kaneapua. My greetings to you, Leapua. My greetings to you, Kahaumana.” At this they all returned the greeting, saying: “Our greetings to you.” After greeting Aukelenuiaiku, they fell to conversing in low tones between themselves, wondering how it was possible that their names were known. After a while Kanemoe said: “How wonderful! How did he come to know our names? And what are we going to give him for this?” One of the others replied: “We have but one thing worthy of giving him, let our sister be given to him for a wife, and he will then be our brother-in-law.” The others [ ] all agreed to this, so the proposition was referred to Aukelenuiaiku who was of course much pleased with the idea."
"A pau ke kamailio ana me Aukelenuiaiku, hoi aku la lakou i ka hale, a hiki lakou, ninau mai la o Namakaokahai: “Auhea ka oukou mea i huli aku nei?” I aku na kaikunane: “Eia’e mahope, ua hookane aku nei makou nau, i loaa ona kaikoeke no makou, no ka mea, he kanaka maikai, aole kina mai luna a lalo, ua like no me oe, nolaila, ua pono no oe ke lawe o kau kane ia.” Ma keia mau olelo a kona mau kaikunane, he mea oluolu loa ia i ka manao o ke ’lii wahine, o Namakaokahai.

Maanei e ike ai kakou i ke ko ana o na olelo a ke ’kua o Aukelenuiaiku, a i ka mana no hoi o Aukelenuiaiku.","After the thing was settled the four birds started ahead for the house, while Aukelenuiaiku followed on behind. When the birds arrived, Namakaokahai asked: “Where is the person that you went in search of?” The brothers replied: “He is coming later. We have offered you to him as his wife so that we will have him for a brother-in-law; for he is a handsome looking man, and is perfect from top to bottom; and he is just like you. We therefore made up our mind that it would be proper that you take him as your husband.” When the sister heard this she was perfectly satisfied, and she expressed her pleasure in accepting the man. We will now go back to Aukelenuiaiku and his god Lonoikoualii. When the four brothers of Namakaokahai returned to their sister, after their offer was accepted by Aukelenuiaiku, his god Lonoikoualii said to him: “These evils and death we have so far been able to overcome; the evils and death that are yet to come which are worse than these are the ones we must be careful about. When we get to the queen, your intended wife’s home, don’t enter the house at once, for it will mean your death; but you must stand outside by the door and you will see for yourself what they intend to do to you. The first person whom you will encounter will be the two women who met us first. If they take compassion on you, then you will be safe. After that the dog will be released, and if you will overcome him, the brothers will be sent out. After these things, they will try to get rid of you by poisoning the food. So you must remember. If they offer you food in the calabash, don’t eat of it, for therein is your death. What you can eat are the melons that are still on the vines, and you must expect this to be your food, meat and water.” The god of Aukelenuiaiku, Lonoikoualii, explained all these things to him in detail and warned him. After imparting these instructions, Lonoikoualii allowed Aukelenuiaiku to go on his way to the home of Namakaokahai. When Aukelenuiaiku arrived at the house, he remained standing by the doorway, where he was greeted by those within. After the greeting they invited Aukelenuiaiku to come inside; but he did not enter; he remained there. By these different things we will see how Aukelenuiaiku’s god was all-powerful, and we will also see how Aukelenuiaiku obeyed all the instructions that were given him."
"Ia Aukelenuiaiku e ku ana ma ka puka o ka hale o Namakaokahai, kuu ia mai la na wahine elua, oia o Upoho, Haapuainanea.

No ka mea, ua waiho ia aku nei na mea ai, imua ona, aohe ona ai.”","While Aukelenuiaiku was standing by the doorway of Namakaokahai’s house, the two women, Upoho and Haapuainanea, were sent for to come to their queen, and when they arrived, Namakaokahai ordered them saying; “Use your power and slay him.” At this command, the two women turned and looked at Aukelenuiaiku. When they saw that it was the young man they had befriended when they were sent out to look for the person the dog was barking at, they were so ashamed that they ran off. Upoho, the one with the form of a rat ran into a hole; Haapuainanea, the lizard woman ran up a tree, and Aukelenuiaiku was saved. After these two, Moela, the watch-dog of the land was sent for, but when it came near to Aukelenuiaiku, he opened his mouth wide showing his teeth and then jumped at Aukelenuiaiku with the [ ] intention of tearing him to pieces, but when he touched Aukelenuiaiku he was killed, reduced to ashes. When the queen saw that her favorite dog was killed, she regretted his death so much that she bowed her head in grief and wept. After the death of her dog, she ordered her four brothers, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana, and commanded them: “Use your power and kill this fellow. Take him and eat him up.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this he entered the house. Upon seeing Aukelenuiaiku, the four brothers of Namakaokahai changed their forms; Kanemoe changed into a rock and he laid at the doorway: Kaneapua changed into a log of wood and laid there: Leapua changed into a coral rock: Kahaumana changed into a hard blue rock. These four brothers did this because they were ashamed of Aukelenuiaiku and they wished to hide themselves. After this Aukelenuiaiku came to where the calabash vine was growing with several green calabashes on the vine; he then took one up and opened it and sat down to have his meal, finding food, meat and water in the green calabash. While Aukelenuiaiku was eating, the brothers of Namakaokahai said to themselves: “How wonderfully all-seeing is that man. He is eating our food. Who has told him where to find it? Food has been placed before him but he would not touch it.” After Aukelenuiaiku had satisfied his hunger and had seen all the things placed before him, the brothers of Namakaokahai stood up in their human forms."
"A pau keia mau mea i ka ike ia e Aukelenuiaiku, alaila, ku mai la na kaikunane o Namakaokahai i luna, me ko lakou mau kino kanaka.

Kaumaha aku la ia ma ke ano o ke akua, e hoolilo ana ia Namakaokahai a me na kaikunane i akua nona, penei: Kahea ae la o Aukelenuiaiku me ka leo nui:","After Aukelenuiaiku had successfully passed through all these trials, he made up his mind to act cunningly. The first thing he did was to make believe that Namakaokahai and her brothers were his gods and therefore prayed to them in a loud voice as follows:"
"“E na aumakua o ka po, na aumakua o ke ao; Namakaokahai, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua, Kahaumana, Upoho, Haapuainanea, Moela, E ola ia’u e ka pii kuahiwi, E ka ae kuahiwi, E ola i ka oukou pulapula, E ola ia’u i kanaka o kai, Eia mai ka ai la, Amama, ua noa.”","“Ye gods of the night, ye gods of the day; Namakaokahai, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua, Kahaumana, Upoho, Haapuainanea, Moela, Give me life, ye trampers of the mountain, Ye climbers of the mountain; Give life to your offspring, Preserve me a man from the lowlands. Here is the food, It is ended; it is released.”"
"Ia Aukelenuiaiku e kaumaha ana i ko lakou mau inoa, he mea akaaka loa ia na lakou, a he mea haohao no hoi i ko lakou lohe ana. Wahi a lakou: “Ua pau loa ko kakou mau inoa i ka loaa ia ia, o kakou iho la no ka paha kona mau akua.” No [ ] keia haohao o lakou i keia mau hana maalea a Aukelenuiaiku, ninau aku la lakou: “O kou mau akua iho la no ia?” “Ae, o ko’u mau akua no ia mai ko’u man kupuna mai, a ko’u mau makua, a loaa mai au.” A lohe lakou i keia mau olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, kena mai la: “E hana hou mai ana oe?” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “He kaao auanei o hoi hou aku, hookahi no kaumaha ana o ke ’kua o ka pono, no ka mea, o ka’u wale no ia e pau nei i ke ’kua:","When Aukelenuiaiku was offering prayers to the several gods, calling them by their respective names in a loud voice, they all laughed and were surprised at hearing all this; they said to themselves: “He knows all our names, and it does seem that we are his gods.” Being much surprised at the action of Aukelenuiaiku, they asked [ ] him: “Are the gods that you have just mentioned your gods?” “Yes, they are my gods handed down from my ancestors to my parents, and from them to me.” When they heard these words, they asked him that he offer them the same prayers again. Aukelenuiaiku then replied: “If it was a story it would be all right to repeat it, but being a prayer to the gods it would not do to repeat it, because, so far it is only from my side that offerings have been made:"
"“Make ke kanaka, kau i luna o ka lele, Make ka puaa, kau i luna o ka lele, Make ka ilio, ka moa, kau i luna o ka lele, Ka maia, ka awa, kau i luna o ka lele, Ka niu, ka ia ula, kau i luna o ka lele.","“Men have been killed and placed on the altar. Pigs have been killed and placed on the altar. Dogs and chickens have been killed and placed on the altar. Bananas and awa have been placed on the altar, Coconuts and red fish have been placed on the altar."
"O keia mau mea a pau loa, he kau wale no i luna o ka lele na ke ’kua, aole au i ike i ka pomaikai a ke ’kua ia’u, ina paha he hanai i kekahi kanaka, ina ua ola na iwi.”","“All these things have I placed on the altar as offerings to my gods, whose names I have just enumerated, but so far I have not received anything in return from them. If these things had been given to some human being, my bones would have been cared for.”"
"Ma keia mau olelo maalea a Aukelenuiaiku, ua loaa mai ia ia ka pomaikai a me ka pono, a ua pakele oia i ka make a Namakaokahai. I ka lohe ana o ua poe kaikunane nei o Namakaokahai i keia mau olelo maalea a Aukelenuiaiku, olelo mai la lakou: “I keia la e ike ai oe i ka pono a ke ’kua, a e uku ia ai kau malama ana, a e hoi ai kou mau lilo a pau loa.”","By these cunning words Aukelenuiaiku received certain benefits, and in time was saved from certain death prepared by Namakaokahai. When the brothers of Namakaokahai heard these words spoken by Aukelenuiaiku, they replied: “Today you will receive your proper dues from the gods in payment for all the good you have faithfully done them, and you shall be paid in full.”"
"Alaila, olelo mai la na kaikunane o Namakaokahai ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E! auhea oe, e hoolohe mai oe i keia mau olelo.

[ ]","The brothers of Namakaokahai then said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Where are you? Listen to these instructions. In case your wife should call you to come to her, don’t do it, for it will mean your death. If she should ask that you come to the door, don’t go, for that too will mean death to you. If she should ask you to come onto the lounge made of mats, don’t go up, for that too means your death. You must, therefore, go and sit by the doorway, and when she finds that you will not respond to her call, she will come to you at the door. If she should ask you to sleep with her, don’t give your consent, for you will get killed; but you sit on her breast and give a sigh, and when she asks of you why you sighed, tell her that you are hungry for something to eat; and if she should order you to come and get something to eat, obey her, for your wife is a goddess and not a human being.” These admonitions were satisfactory to Aukelenuiaiku. In all these things we know that Aukelenuiaiku after all received some good in return for the offerings he pretended to have made to the gods, for in the end he won Namakaokahai and she became his wife.

While she was with child, one day Aukelenuiaiku and his wife went in bathing, and while they were bathing Aukelenuiaiku went over to where his box was left, as was his custom, to see his god. As he was approaching the place he heard his god Lonoikoualii calling to him: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, we are going to be killed. Here comes Halulu, the man-eating bird from heaven.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard the call he turned and looked up to heaven."
"Ua paapu ka malamalama o ka la i na eheu o Halulu. A pau ka Aukelenuiaiku nana ana i luna, lalau aku la ia i ka pahu o kona akua, o Lonoikoualii. Ia ia e lalau ana a paa aku ka lima i ka pahu, ia wa loaa ke poo o Aukelenuiaiku ia Halulu, a komo i kona waha, a lawe ia aku la i luna o ka pali.

After looking at the bird for some time he reached down and picked up his box which contained his god Lonoikoualii. While in the act of picking up the box, and his hands had just come in contact with it, his head was caught in the mouth of the bird Halulu and he was carried up to the cliff. In the side of this cliff was a cave which was the home of the bird. Aukelenuiaiku was carried up and left there. In the cave at this time were four men who had been carried there by the bird to serve as food. When Aukelenuiaiku was left at the cave they greeted him and took pity on him, for they knew that he would be killed by the bird Halulu. While the men were talking by themselves, Aukelenuiaiku asked them: “What are you talking about?” “We are expressing our regrets—for you are such a handsome fellow—for you will be killed and eaten up by the bird.” Aukelenuiaiku then asked the men: “How does the bird come to get its victims?” “The right wing comes in first and reaches out for two men, and after they are devoured the left wing will come in and take up two more men, then the beak will come down and devour them.” “Which two men will the bird come for first?” Two of the men replied: “We will be the first.” “Is the cave very deep?” “Yes, it is quite deep.” Aukelenuiaiku then instructed the men, saying: “You two go in as far as you can and remain there, so that when the wing reaches in for you two, I will cut it off here at the mouth of the cave, while these two will start the fire.”"
"Ia lakou e kamailio ana no na mea e pili ana i ka make o ua manu nei, komo ana ka eheu akau o ua manu nei, kokolo aku la a loaa ua mau kanaka nei i loko lilo o ke ana, umii mai la ka eheu a paa ua mau kanaka nei. A makaukau ka eheu e lawe mai ia laua, kahea mai laua ia Aukelenuiaiku: “Eia maua i luna o ka eheu kahi i kau ai.” A lohe o Aukelenuiaiku, wehe ae la ia i ka pahu, lalau iho la i ke koi, a ooki iho la i ka eheu o ua manu nei, a moku iho la. A moku ka eheu akau, iho mai la ka eheu hema, ooki iho la no o Aukelenuiaiku, moku, kiola no keia mau kanaka i loko o ke ahi; mahope o ka moku ana o na eheu, iho mai la ka nuku, ooki aku ana o Aukelenuiaiku, kaawale ke poo me ke kino. [ ]","While they were talking about killing the bird, in came the right wing of the bird and it began stretching further and further into the cave until it reached the two men, then it grabbed them. When the wing was about to be drawn to the body with the two men, they called out to Aukelenuiaiku: “Here we are on the wing of the bird.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this he opened his box, took out the axe and began cutting the wing of the bird until it was severed. As soon as the right wing was cut the left wing reached into the cave, when Aukelenuiaiku cut that wing off also, and the men took it up and threw it into the fire. After the two wings had been cut off, the beak reached into the cave and that too was cut off, clean from the body. [ ]"
"A make ua manu nei o Halulu, huhuki ae la ia i na hulu ma ke poo o ua manu la, a kiola mai la i lalo. O keia hulu i huhuki ia ai e Aukelenuiaiku, lele mai la ia a ma ke alo o Namakaokahai, ike iho la ia, o na hulu i ke poo o ka manu, o Halulu.","After the bird Halulu was killed, he pulled a few feathers out of the bird’s head and threw them to the ground away from the cliff. These feathers that were pulled by Aukelenuiaiku flew until they fell in the very presence of Namakaokahai, where they were seen by her and recognized as the head feathers of the bird Halulu."
"Maanei, e kamailio uuku kakou no ka manu a me Namakaokahai, i ko laua pili ana ma ke kumu. He kaikunane o Halulu manu, no Namakaokahai, ke ’lii wahine o ka aina o Kalakeenuiakane. A ike o Namakaokahai ua make o Halulu, kona kaikunane, kahea aku la ia i kona mau kaikunane, ia Kanemoe, Leapua, Kahaumana, Kaneapua. I aku o Namakaokahai ia lakou: “Eia o Hinawaikolii, na hulu i ka lae o Halulu, ua make, ua pepehi ia.” A lohe na kaikunane, olelo aku la ia Namakaokahai: “Ua pono no ia ke make, no ka mea, he hana ino kana, he ai i ke kanaka.”","We will now take up the relationship between the bird and Namakaokahai, for they were connected. The bird Halulu was a cousin to Namakaokahai, the queen of the land of Kalakeenuiakane. When Namakaokahai saw that her cousin Halulu was dead she called for her brothers, Kanemoe, Leapua, Kahaumana and Kaneapua. When they came to her she said to them: “Here are Hinawaikoli, the feathers from the forehead of Halulu, who is dead. He has been killed.” When the brothers heard this, they said to Namakaokahai: “It is quite right that the bird should be killed, because he is an evil thing, he eats men.”"
"Ma keia make ana o ua manu nei ia Aukelenuiaiku, okioki iho la lakou i ka io, a koala aku la i luna o ke ahi, a ai iho la lakou. Mahope o laila, imi iho la lakou i alanui e hoi ai i lalo nei, aka, e noho ana ia wa, ko Halulu lua, he manu no, o Kiwaha ka inoa. Haawi mai la ia ia Aukelenuiaiku i alanui.

After their meal was finished, they began to study how to get down from the cliff. At this time there was another bird in the cave, the mate of Halulu, by the name of Kiwaha. This bird gave Aukelenuiaiku the means of getting down the cliff, by giving him a short-ended rainbow, one with only three colors, yellow, red and green. By means of this rainbow they reached the bottom of the cliff. In thus getting away successfully, the four men were thankful to Aukelenuiaiku, for they knew that they were rescued from a terrible death, and so they were very grateful for the kindness shown them."
"A hiki o Aukelenuiaiku i lalo me na kanaka, lawe ae la o Kiwaha i ke alanui anuenue i ka pali, mahope o laila, ninau aku o Aukelenuiaiku i na kanaka: “Heaha ka oukou mau mea ono?” I mai lakou: “He ko ka’u, he uwala ka’u, he maia ka’u, he kalo ka’u.” Olelo aku o Aukelenuiaiku ia lakou: “He kapu ke ko na kuu keiki, ina e ai, o kona manawa ia e make ai, pela ka uala, ka maia, ke kalo, nolaila, mai noho oukou a lalau i keia mau mea a pau loa ke hele kakou ma ke alanui, o make oukou.” A pau ke ao ana o Aukelenuiaiku ia lakou, alaila, hele aku la lakou.

After this Aukelenuiaiku asked the men: “What do you want?” They each answered: “I want a piece of sugar-cane.” “I want a potato.” “I want a banana.” “I want a taro.” Aukelenuiaiku then said to them: “The sugar-cane is kapued for my son. If any one eats it he will die. So are the potatoes, the bananas and the taro. So I will advise each of you not to touch these things as we go on our way, else you will all die.” After giving them this advice they all started out. On the way, however, the men did not adhere to the advice given them by Aukelenuiaiku, for he who wanted the sugar-cane took a piece and ate it, so he died; the other three men also took up the things they craved for and they also died. Thus did the four men die, for not keeping the advice given them by Aukelenuiaiku."
"A pau lakou i ka lilo i ka make, koe iho la o Aukelenuiaiku, hoi aku la ia a hiki i ka hale, ike mai la ka wahine me na kaikoeke, uwe mai la, a halawai ae la lakou me ka oluolu aloha.

Nolaila, haawi mai la o Namakaokahai, kana wahine i ka ea o ka aina, a me na mea a pau loa i loko o ko Aukelenuiaiku lima, a me kona mau kino ano akua kekahi.","After the death of the four men, Aukelenuiaiku continued on by himself until he reached the house. When the wife and the brothers-in-law saw Aukelenuiaiku, they all wept for joy and he was welcomed home. After this, Aukelenuiaiku and his wife lived on happily, each determined to love each other more and more. The wife [ ] had no other thoughts but of the comfort of her husband. They continued living this way for some time. Because of this great love for her husband, Namakaokahai gave over the kingdom to her husband, as well as everything else at her command; and she even gave him the command and the use of her supernatural bodies."
"I kekahi la, komo aku la o Aukelenuiaiku i loko o ka hale e ai ai, ia ia e ai ana’ wehe malu ae la o Namakaokahai i ka pahu o ke ’kua o Aukelenuiaiku, a nana iho la i loko, e waiho ana ke koi a me ka pahi i loko, lalau iho la ia ma ka oi o ke koi a hamo iho la, moku ae la ka lima, a kahe ke koko, nolaila, pane iho la o Namakaokahai: “Kupanaha! he mea maikai no ka hoi ka kuu kane e huna nei;” a pau kona nana ana, huna iho la ia. A pau ka ai ana o Aukelenuiaiku, hoi mai la ia a noho.

Looking in she saw the axe and the knife. She then took up the axe and ran her fingers over the edge, cutting her fingers so they bled. Namakaokahai then said: “How strange! here my husband has some very good things which he is hiding from me!” After looking over these things she closed the box and put it away. When Aukelenuiaiku finished his meal he returned and sat down. Namakaokahai then asked him, pretending not to have seen what was in the box, saying: “Say, what useful things did you bring with you when you came?” Aukelenuiaiku then picked up the box and opening it, he took out the axe and knife and gave them over to his wife, saying: “These two things which I have brought with me from the land of Kuaihelani are very good and useful. These two things together with my god are the three things of the greatest value.” The wife then asked him: “What are these things good for?” “The axe will cut a log of wood in two. The knife is also useful, for it can cut any tough thing you have.” When Namakaokahai heard this she said to her husband: “Say, your valuable things together with mine we will leave with our child.”"
"Ma keia wahi aku, e ike kakou i ka mana o Namakaokahai, a me kona make ole i nei mea oi o ke koi, a e maopopo no auanei ia kakou he ano aku no kona. A pau ko laua kamailio ana no ke koi a me ka pahi, olelo aku o Namakaokahai i kana kane ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E oki mai oe ia’u i ke koi.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Kupanaha oe! o oe no ka’u wahine ponoi, a pehea la wau e ooki aku ai ia oe, a make iho; e aho, i ke kanaka e au e ooki ai i ke koi a moku, a i ole ia he hoa hakaka, aole o oe o ko’u io ponoi.” I mai ka wahine: “Kahaha! e haawi hoi paha auanei oe i ke koi ia hai, lilo hoi ka mea maikai a ka kaua keiki, nolaila, e hoao mai no oe ia’u.” A no ko Namakaokahai paakiki loa, ae aku kana kane; ma keia ae ana o kana kane, ua lilo ia i mea oluolu loa ia Namakaokahai. Mahope o keia ae ana o Aukelenuiaiku e ooki aku ia Namakaokahai i ke koi, hoolei loa aku la na wawae o Namakaokahai a pololei, ooki iho la o Aukelenuiaiku i ke koi.","Further on in our story we will see the supernatural powers of Namakaokahai, and how it was impossible to kill her, although she was cut up with the axe; by which acts we will know that she was not human. After talking about the axe and knife, Namakaokahai said to her husband: “You proceed and cut me into pieces with the axe.” Aukelenuiaiku said: “How strange of you to ask me to do such a thing as to cut you up, my own wife! How can I do such a thing, for it will mean your death? Rather let me cut up some other person with this axe, or my opponent in some fight, not you, my own flesh.” The wife replied: “You might give this axe to someone else and thus deprive our child of such a useful thing. Therefore I want you to try it on me.” And because Namakaokahai insisted on it, the husband finally gave in, whereat she was much pleased. When this consent was given Namakaokahai stretched out her legs and Aukelenuiaiku severed them with the axe."
"A pau loa ke kino o Namakaokahai i ka moku i ke koi a Aukelenuiaiku, ninau ae la ke poo o Namakaokahai ia Aukelenuiaiku: “Ea! pau ae la kau mea maikai e ke kane?” “Ae, ua pau loa ae la, no ka mea, a moku keia mea he kanaka, he make kona hope.” Mahope o keia olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, pane mai o Namakaokahai: “Ae, pau ae la kau mea maikai, o ka’u mea maikai koe.” Ma keia olelo a Namakaokahai, hoi ae la kona kino a hui ma kahi mua, pela na wahi a pau loa i kaawale, a ola ae la ia e like me mamua.

Alaila, oili ae la o Namakaokahai a ku ana maluna o ka welau o ka pali, a nana iho i ke kane me ka ninau iho: “E aha ana oe?” I aku ke kane: “E mahalo iho ana au, o kau mea maikai, o ka’u mea maikai, na ka kaua keiki ia.” Ma keia olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, he kanaaho wale ae no, he makau kona e noho ana.","After the body of Namakaokahai had been cut up into several pieces, the head asked of Aukelenuiaiku: “Are these all the useful things my husband brought with him?” “Yes, these are all; and I am surprised at you, for when a person is cut up in this manner, death is certain.” Namakaokahai then replied: “If these are all the useful things you have, I will now show you what I have.” Saying this, the pieces began to get together of their own accord, and in a short space of time the body was again complete and restored as before. She then called for her four brothers, Kaneapua, Kanemoe, Leapua and Kahaumana. Upon their arrival the sister asked them: “What shall I change myself into? Shall it be into a cliff?” Her brothers then answered: “Yes, change yourself into a cliff.” At that very moment a great, high cliff stood before them, smooth and straight up and down, where the koae was seen flying. Aukelenuiaiku looked at it and touched its smooth sides with his hands with fear and great excitement. He next saw Namakaokahai, his wife, standing on the very top of the cliff; then he saw her looking down at him, and she called: “What are you doing?” The husband replied: “I am admiring your supernatural powers. Your useful things together with mine will be a great inheritance for our child.” In making this reply, Aukelenuiaiku made believe that he was not afraid; but in fact he was almost overcome with fear."
"Ia Namakaokahai e ku ana i luna o ka pali, kahea iho la i na kaikunane ona eha: “E aha la wau, e kai paha?” Ae aku na kaikunane, “ae, e kai oe.” Lilo ae la ka aina i kai, he nalu ma na wahi a pau loa, aohe wahi kaawale i koe, a o Aukelenuiaiku, i loko o ka manawa e poi nei ka nalu, oili ae la o Namakaokahai, a ninau mai la i ke kane: “E Aukelenuiaiku, e aha ana oe?” I aku ke kane: “E mahalo ae ana au i keia mea maikai au.”","While Namakaokahai was standing there on the cliff, she called out to her four brothers and said: “What shall I change myself into now? Shall it be into an ocean?” The brothers replied: “Yes, change yourself into a vast ocean.” At that very moment the whole cliff dissolved and turned into a great ocean, with its surface covered with mighty waves, so completely that nothing else could be seen. Aukelenuiaiku was at this time being engulfed by the water and he was sore afraid, but at the appearance of Namakaokahai and questioned by her, “What are you doing?” he replied: “I am admiring your great powers.”"
"A mahope o ke kai, kuu iho la o Namakaokahai i ke kino ahi ona, pau ae la ka aina i ke ahi a puni, aohe wahi i koe. A o ke kane hoi o Aukelenuiaiku, aia i loko o ka lapalapa o ke ahi kahi i noho ai. Alaila, ninau iho ka wahine: “E aha ana oe e Aukelenuiaiku?” “E mahalo ae ana au i keia mea maikai au o ke ahi.” [ ]","After the ocean, Namakaokahai changed herself into a terrible fire and the land was enveloped in flame, covering the whole surface as far as the eye could see. Aukelenuiaiku was entirely surrounded by the fire, in the midst of which he saw his wife and heard her asking him, saying: “What are you doing, Aukelenuiaiku?” He replied: “I am still admiring your great powers and the fire.” [ ]"
"O keia mau mea ekolu, o ka pali, o ke kai, o ke ahi he mau kino lakou no Namakaokahai, ma kona ano akua, koe nae ke kino lele ona, ua haawi aku ia i kana kane. A o ke kino lele o Namakaokahai, ua aua ia i kana kane, aole i haawi aku, no kona manao, o lele auanei, nele ia i ke kane ole, nolaila, aua ia. Aka, o na kaikunane ona, ua manao lakou e hoike malu i ko lakou kaikoeke ia kino.","These three things, the cliff, the ocean and the fire were the three supernatural bodies of Namakaokahai, and she gave to her husband the power to change himself into these three different things. She, however, did not reveal her fourth form and power, the power to fly through space. The reason why she did not reveal this fourth power to her husband and did not wish him to possess it, was because she was afraid that he might take it into his mind to fly away and deprive her of him, so she thought she would keep this power to herself. The brothers, however, did not approve of this, and decided to teach their brother-in-law secretly how to acquire this power."
"Maanei, e hoolohe kakou i na olelo ninau a na kaikoeke o Aukelenuiaiku eha, a e nana kakou i ko lakou aloha i ko lakou kaikoeke, a e hoomanao iho i na olelo mua i hala, penei: “I keia la e ike ai oe i ka pono o ke ’kua.” Ninau mai la na kaikoeke o Aukelenuiaiku: “Ea! ua haawi mai anei ko wahine ia oe i na kino ona a pau loa?” “Ae,” pela o Aukelenuiaiku. “Na kino hea ka mea a ko wahine i haawi mai ai ia oe?” “O ke kino pali, o ke kino kai, o ke kino ahi.” I aku na kaikoeke: “Aole i pau loa mai la na kino o ko wahine, koe aku la ke kino lele ia oe.” “Ae, ua aua kuu wahine ia mea, aole i haawi mai ia’u.” I aku na kaikoeke: “No ka manao o ko wahine, o lele loa oe a nalowale, aole e hoi hou mai, nolaila, aua kela.” Mahope o keia mau olelo i aku na kaikoeke: “E ao kakou ia oe, i ke kino lele o ko wahine, i ike oe, eia nae, mai olelo oe i ko wahine.”","We will here see how the four brothers-in-law of Aukelenuiaiku gave him the power to fly, in payment for the offerings made by him to the gods. Some time after this his brothers-in-law said to him: “Today you will realize the blessings of the deity.” After a while he was asked: “Say, has your wife given you the power to change yourself into different forms?” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “Yes.” “What different forms did she give you?” “The power to change into a cliff, into an ocean, and into fire.” The brothers-in-law replied: “Then she has not given you all her powers. She has kept to herself the power to fly.” “Yes, my wife has reserved that; she did not give it to me.” The brothers-in-law continued, saying: “It is because your wife thought you might fly off and never come back again. That is the reason why she has kept this power from you.” After this the brothers-in-law said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Let us teach you how to get this flying power of your wife, so that you may be able to possess it. But you must not tell your wife of this.”"

They first taught him how to jump and how to fly to certain places; then they asked him to jump to the top of a shelf. After he was successful in this he was requested to jump to the top roof batten of the house. Aukelenuiaiku then jumped and held it for a while, then fell to the floor. In this falling, Namakaokahai heard it, and she got up and came to her brothers’ house, and asked them: “What are you doing?” “We are learning how to box.” “What is that?” “It is played this way. Kanemoe stands up like this on this side, and Kaneapua stands up on that side; then they strike at each other, and the one who gets hit real hard falls to the floor. That was the noise you heard.” When Namakaokahai heard this she said: “I see that my husband has some good thing hidden that he has not shown me. How mysterious you are!” After this Namakaokahai returned to her own house. After she disappeared, Aukelenuiaiku again made another attempt to reach the top batten, but again he was unsuccessful and he fell to the floor. [ ] Namakaokahai again heard this and she came to her brothers’ house and asked them: “I believe you are teaching my husband how to fly.” “No, we are wrestling.” “How is that done?” “One stands up on this side, and one on the other side; they then take ahold of one another and each tries to throw the other down. The one who is thrown down made the noise you heard.” Because of this satisfactory reply Namakaokahai again retired to their house. After she was gone, Aukelenuiaiku again made another attempt and this time he was successful. He next came out and flew to the top of the house, and in this he was again successful. From the roof Aukelenuiaiku flew up into the sky, and he went so high that his brothers-in-law were unable to see him. After a while Aukelenuiaiku returned to the ground and his brothers-in-law said to him: “Yes, you know how to fly now.”"
"Ia laua e noho pu ana, he kane a he wahine, ua aaki ke aloha me ka hoopaa i ko laua mau kino, a ua akaka loa ka hapai keiki o kana wahine akua, o Namakaokahai.

After this the two lived on in peace and they never went out of sight of each other; they were indeed a loving couple. It also became apparent that Namakaokahai, his god-wife, was with child. Before its birth, however, Namakaokahai made known to her husband the name of the child: it was Kauwilanuimakehaikalani (the lightning which we see in a rain-storm). Aukelenuiaiku, however, wished to have the child called after the name of his god Lonoikoualii."
"A no ka nui loa o ko Namakaokahai aloha i ke kane, ia Aukelenuiaiku, nolaila, pili paa loa laua, i ke kau a me ka hooili, i ka la a me ka ua, i ka wa wi a me ka wa maona, i ka po a me ke ao, i na la a pau loa.

They were together constantly, at all seasons and times, in dry and wet weather, in times of famine and of plenty, in the daytime and at night, in fact they were together all the time. Namakaokahai also gave all her possessions to Aukelenuiaiku; from the things that were above to the things below; from the things in the uplands to the things in the lowlands; great things and small things; the things that were within to the things that were without. All were given to her husband."

Ua hooili au i na mea a pau no kuu kane. O luna, o lalo, o uka, o kai, o ka hao pae, o ke meki ku i ka honua, o ka palaoa, o ka ea makaulii, o ka maulele i ka aina, o ka huhui hoku.

Ma keia wahi a kakou e hoolohe nei, e noonoo iho kakou me ka manao oiaio, i luna o ka lani, keia lele ana o Aukelenuiaiku me na kaikoeke.","When Namakaokahai was ready to give everything she possessed to her husband, Aukelenuiaiku, she called her brothers, Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua and Kahaumana. As they stood in her presence, she said to them: “You go up to my uncle and cousin, Kuwahailo and Makalii, and inform them that I have given unto my husband all my possessions. The things above, below, in the uplands, in the lowlands, the drift iron, the iron that stands in the earth, the whale’s tooth, the (ea) turtle shell, the things that grow in the land, and the cluster of stars. Also, tell my uncle and cousin [ ] that all these things are now in my husband’s possession; and I also want you to take my husband to them so that they may become acquainted with each other.” All these words of Namakaokahai were pleasing to them. We must bear in mind that this trip to be undertaken by the brothers of Namakaokahai and Aukelenuiaiku was to heaven."
"Mahope o ko Namakaokahai olelo ana mai ia lakou, lele aku la lakou a ke kua , hiwi hoomaha, ma ia lele hookahi ana, ua hala aku o Aukelenuiaiku i ka lani. Ma keia lele ana o Aukelenuiaiku, hiki mua aku la ia i kahi o kana wahine, o Namakaokahai, he wahi kapu loa ia, aohe mea hele ma laila. Ia Aukelenuiaiku e ku ana ma kahi kapu o Namakaokahai, nana aku la o Kuwahailo, a olelo iho i loko ona: “Auwe! make kuu kaikamahine, ke hiki nei ke kupu i luna nei, no ka mea, aohe kanaka nana e pii mai o luna nei, hiki no ke kanaka, ua make o lalo.”","After Namakaokahai had delivered her orders to her brothers, they began their flight, going as far as the top of the mountains where they rested. In this first flight Aukelenuiaiku went on to heaven, reaching his wife’s place, a most sacred sphere, not accessible to anyone. Although they flew at the same time with Aukelenuiaiku, he got ahead of his brothers-in-law and arrived in heaven first. While Aukelenuiaiku was standing in the sacred place of Namakaokahai, he was seen by Kuwahailo, who said to himself: “Alas! I am afraid my niece is dead; that is why a wizard has arrived, for no one can get up here unless those below are dead.”"
"Ma keia lele ana o Aukelenuiaiku i luna i ka lani, aole ona manao he kaua, a he hakaka, ua lele oia me ka nanea walewale. Aka, maloko o ka olelo a kona akua ia ia, a Lonoikoualii, he kaua, penei na olelo: “E Aukelenuiaiku e! make kaua, eia la he kaua ko luna nei. E aahu oe i ko kapa lehu mai ko poo a ko manea wawae, mai lohi oe o make auanei.” Ma keia mau olelo a ke ’kua ia Aukelenuiaiku, ma laila i maopopo ai he kaua ko luna. Mahope o ka olelo a ke ’kua ia Aukelenuiaiku, oili mai la ka momoku ahi mai loko mai o ka lima o Kuwahailo a a ana i ka honua. O ka inoa o ua momoku ahi la, o Kukuena, a mahope ona kuu ia mai la ka pohaku o Ikuwa, he pohaku koeleele, oia ka hekili. A pa keia mau mea i ke kapa lehu o Aukelenuiaiku, he mea ole laua, he opala, he mea uhauha na ka makani. Ma keia moolelo, ua olelo ia, i ka wa i pa ai ka hekili i ke kapa lehu o Aukelenuiaiku, nolaila mai ka nakeke o ka hekili a hiki i keia la.","In this flight to heaven, Aukelenuiaiku did not think that he was going to meet anyone who would oppose him, and consequently he went along unguarded; but through the powers of his god Lonoikoualii he was warned in time, for the god called out to him: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, watch or else we will be killed, for I see that we are going to be attacked. Put on your garment of ashes and cover yourself from head to feet; don’t be slow or we will be killed.” By this warning Aukelenuiaiku knew that a conflict was about to begin, and he immediately put on his war pau. As soon as his god finished giving the warning a bolt of fire was sent out from the hand of Kuwahailo and the land began to be in flames. The name of this bolt of fire was Kukuena. After which a large black rock was sent out, called Ikuwa, the thunder. When these things came in contact with the robe of ashes of Aukelenuiaiku, they became as nothing, like chaff and were blown away by the wind."
"A mao ae la ka momoku ahi a me ka pohaku, nana aku la o Kuwahailo ia Aukelenuiaiku, e ku mai ana no, aole i make. He mea kaumaha loa ia i ko Kuwahailo manao ana, a he mea inoino loa i kona ike ana aku e oia mai ana kona enemi, ke ahikanana o Kuaihelani. Ia wa, kuu hou o Kuwahailo i ka lua o ka momoku ahi, oia o Mahuia, a kuu hou i ka lua o ka pohaku, oia o Welehu, o ka lua ia o na hekili ikaika loa, nakeke, opaipai ka lani, naueue na kukulu o ka honua, haki kaikoo o ka moana, nakaka na pohaku, kahako ka pali, lele ke koae. I ka pa ana i ke kapa lehu o Aukelenuiaiku, ua lilo ia i mea ole, heaha la kona ano, he puahiohio paha.","In this story it was said that when the thunderbolt came in contact with the garment of Aukelenuiaiku it caused the roaring and rumbling of the thunder which is heard to this day. After the bolt of fire was extinguished and the rock became as nothing, Kuwahailo looked at Aukelenuiaiku and lo, he was still in the place where he saw him, still alive. This grieved Kuwahailo heavily: it bode dire trouble that his enemy, the defiant of Kuaihelani, should stand alive before him. After a time he sent another bolt of fire, called Mahuia, and another rock, called Welehu, the second strongest bolt of thunder. The roar was deafening, the heaven rocked, the foundations of the earth were shaken, the waves of the ocean rose high as mountains, large rocks were loosened from the cliffs, the cliffs were opened up and the birds on the mountain heights were alarmed. When these came in contact with the robe of ashes of Aukelenuiaiku they became as nothing, like a gust of wind."
"A hala keia make a Kuwahailo, i nana aku ka hana i ka oioi o Kuaihelani, e ku mai ana no, aole i make, i iho o Kuwahailo: “Ka! akahi no ka make ole o nei kanaka, no ka mea, o ka pau no keia o na mea make, aohe make iho.” [ ]","After these death aims of Kuwahailo he again looked and saw Aukelenuiaiku standing in the same place, and still alive. Kuwahailo then said to himself: “Here I have exhausted all my death-dealing weapons and still that man is not killed yet. This is the first man that has been able to withstand all this.” [ ]"
"Maanei e hoomaha iki kakou i ka hoolohe ana no Kuwahailo, a me Aukelenuiaiku, a e kamailio kakou no na kaikunane o Namakaokahai, na kaikoeke o Aukelenuiaiku . Ma keia lele ana o lakou mai ka honua ae a ka lani, ua pakeu aku ko Aukelenuiaiku lele i ko na kaikoeke.

Ninau mai ko lakou makuakane: “Pehea ko oukou kaikuahine?” “Aia no ke noho la.” “A nohea hoi nei kanaka kupua?” “O ko hunona ia o ke kane ia a Namakaokahai.” A lohe o Kuwahailo i keia olelo a na keiki, ku iho la ia me ka makau a me ka haalulu, a noonoo iho la ia i kana mea e hana aku ai ia Aukelenuiaiku, ka ihu kaeaea o Kuaihelani. I aku la ia i kana hunona: “E, i mua ou wau i hana aku ai i ka hewa, a me ka pono ole, a nolaila, ke waiho aku nei au i ka mohai i mua ou, elua lau kanaka (ewalu haneri ia).” A hiki o Kuwahailo me na lau kanaka elua i mua o Aukelenuiaiku, ninau mai o Aukelenuiaiku: “He kanaka aha keia?” Olelo mai kona makuahunowai: “He mohai ia oe.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Ua oki ke kanaka no ka moopuna, a no ka aina no hoi.”","We will here leave Aukelenuiaiku and Kuwahailo for a time while we take up the brothers of Namakaokahai. In making their flight from the earth to heaven, they saw that Aukelenuiaiku was going much faster than they were. The length of time they took on this voyage was five days and five nights, while Aukelenuiaiku covered the distance in only one day and one night: hence, when Kuwahailo was pouring out his death-dealing bolts, the brothers were still on their way. When they were approaching heaven, and saw from a distance the fire-bolt called Kukuena, and the black rock Ikuwa being hurled at Aukelenuiaiku, they all cried out in alarm, for they thought their brother-in-law would be killed. They then flew to a rocky valley and there laid down; after the fire and the roar of the thunder had gone by they came out, and when they looked they saw Aukelenuiaiku still standing. They then called to him to come and hide himself between the rocks in the valley, for they knew that other death-dealing bolts were yet to come; but Aukelenuiaiku answered them: “You stay there where you are while I remain here until I shall kill Kuwahailo.” As soon as the last death-bolt had passed by, the nephews of Kuwahailo came out and stood in the presence of their uncle. He then asked them: “How is your sister?” “She is at home.” “And whence comes this wizard?” “That is your nephew, the husband of Namakaokahai.” When Kuwahailo heard this from his nephews, he stood there in fear and trembling, and wondered what he was to do to his nephew Aukelenuiaiku, the hero of Kuaihelani. After a pause of some time he said to Aukelenuiaiku: “My nephew, I have indeed sinned against you, for I have this day treated you unkindly. I will therefore make an offering before you of eight hundred men.” When Kuwahailo returned with his eight hundred men, and they stood before Aukelenuiaiku, Aukelenuiaiku turned to Kuwahailo and asked him: “What are these men for?” His uncle replied: “They are my offerings to you.” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “Leave the men for your grandnephew and as people for the land.”"
"Mahope o laila, hai aku la na keiki ia Kuwahailo: “He olelo ka makou i hoouna ia mai nei e ko kaikamahine e hai aku ia oe.” Ninau aku o Kuwahailo: “Heaha kana olelo ia oukou?” Eia kana olelo ia makou: “O luna, o lalo, o uka, o kai, maluna ko hunona, malalo aku oe e noho ai, a me na mea a pau loa.” Ma keia mau olelo a na keike he mea oluolu loa ia i ko Kuwahailo manao, ae mahope o keia olelo ana, ahaolelo iho la lakou. Ma keia ahaolelo ana, hele mai la o Makalii e halawai me Aukelenuiaiku. Ma keia hele ana mai o Makalii, hele pu mai la me kana wahine me Malanaikuaheahea.","After this the brothers-in-law of Aukelenuiaiku delivered their message, saying: “We have been sent by your niece to bring you a message.” Kuwahailo then asked: “What is the message?” “She told us to tell you, ‘that the things above, below, in the uplands, in the lowlands, are your [new] relative’s: you will live under him: everything has been given to this man,’ her husband.” This was agreeable to Kuwahailo. After this, they all sat down and held a council. In the council, Makalii came and met Aukelenuiaiku. In coming to meet Aukelenuiaiku, Makalii also brought his wife, Malanaikuaheahea."
"Maanei e kamailio uuku no ka wahine a Makalii. O keia wahine o Malanaikuaheahea, he wahine maikai a me ka nani loa, o kona kino ke nana aku, ua like me ka ula o ke ahi ka ula. I kona ku ana a hele mai kona hale noho mai, ua paku ia ka malamalama o ka la, a pouli, nee mai la ka uakoko, uhi mai la ka ohu, kokolo mai la ka noe, halii mai la ke awa, kahe mai la ka wai ula, olapa ka uila.

O ka la, ua pau ia ma hope ona, o ke anuenue malalo o kona mau wawae. A ike o Aukelenuiaiku i keia mau mea a pau i mua ona, a me ka wahine a Makalii, ua maule kona manao, ua poniuniu kona lunaikehala, a ua maule kona noonoo kanaka, nolaila, olelo o Aukelenuiaiku, e hoi i lalo nei.","We will here speak a few words about the wife of Makalii. This woman, Malanaikuaheahea, was a very beautiful woman. Her skin, to look upon her, was red as fire. On coming out of her house, her beauty overshadowed the rays of the sun, so that darkness covered the land, and the red rain would be seen approaching; the fog would also come, and after these things had been seen the fine rain would come, then the red waters would flow and the lightning would play in the heavens. After these things, then the form of Malanaikuaheahea would be seen coming along over the tips [ ] of the fingers of her servants, in all her beauty. Makalii thought a good deal of his wife and he made much of her. The sun was eclipsed by her, and the rainbow was her footstool. When Aukelenuiaiku saw these different things and then the wife of Makalii, he grew faint and dizzy, and could hardly control himself, so he made up his mind to come back to earth."
"A hiki o Aukelenuiaiku i mua o kana wahine a me ka laua keiki noho iho la laua he kane a he wahine, a hala elua malama. Ia wa, moe iho la o Aukelenuiaiku i ke awakea, a i loko o keia moe ana, ike aku la ia ma ka moe uhane i ka uhane o kana keiki, o Kaumaiilunaoholaniku. O keia keiki a Aukelenuiaiku, oia no kela keiki a lakou i holo pu mai ai mai Kuaihelani mai, a kela kaikuaana huhu o Aukelenuiaiku, a Kekamakahinuiaiku. A ike o Aukelenuiaiku i ka uhane o ua keiki la, uwe iho la ia i loko o kona wa hiamoe, a puoho ae la me ia uwe no. Ma keia ala ana, kau mai la ka halialia ia Aukelenuiaiku, no ke keiki a me na kaikuaana, nolaila, uwe hamama ae la ia. Ia Aukelenuiaiku e uwe hamama ana, ninau aku la kana wahine o Namakaokahai: “Heaha hoi kau e uwe nei?” “E uwe ana au i ke aloha i kuu keiki.” “Ua loaa keiki no ka oe?” “Aohe na’u, na ko’u kaikuaana, i ka la a makou i ku mai ai ianei ka make ana. A maloko o kuu moe uhane, ike aku nei au i kona uhane, e pii mai ana mai loko mai o ke kai, oia ka maka mua o na uhane a pau loa.”","When Aukelenuiaiku arrived in the presence of his wife and their child, after an absence of several days, he remained with her for about two months. One day on taking a nap at noontime he fell into a deep sleep and he dreamed a dream in which he saw the spirit of his nephew, Kaumaiilunaoholaniku. This boy was the son of his oldest brother, the boy who accompanied them on the voyage from Kuaihelani, the son of Kekamakahinuiaiku, the brother who had a violent temper. At sight of the spirit of his nephew, Aukelenuiaiku wept in his sleep, and when he awoke he was still crying. Upon waking from his sleep he could not get the effects off his mind and he remembered his nephew and brothers, so he wept aloud. While Aukelenuiaiku was weeping his wife asked him: “What are you crying about?” “I am crying for the love of my child.” “Have you a child, then?” “Not mine, the son of my oldest brother. He died with my brothers on the day our ship arrived here. In my dream I saw his spirit coming up from the bottom of the sea, followed by the spirits of his father and uncles.”"
"A lohe kana wahine i keia mau olelo a kana kane, i mai la ia: “Ua ola ko keiki.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Pehea e ola ai?” I mai kana wahine: “Aia a hoolohe oe i ka’u olelo, alaila, ola ko keiki.” “Pehea au e hoolohe ai?” “E lawe oe i ka ai a me ka ia a waho, i laila oe e ai ai, malama o ike mai ka uhane o ko keiki i ko ai aku, hele mai. A i hiki mai ka uhane o ko keiki i ko alo, mai hopu oe, a i hele a ku ma ko kua mai hopu no oe, aka, i hele mai a noho i luna o ko uha, alaila oe hopu ae, ola ko keiki a me ou kaikuaana, aole e make, no ka mea, e pii ana ka uhane i ke kuahiwi, i ka ai pioia.”","When his wife heard this, she said to her husband: “Your nephew can be saved.” Aukelenuiaiku asked: “How can I bring him back to life?” The wife replied: “Only when you obey my instructions; then, and only then, will your nephew come back to life.” “What is it you wish me to do?” “Take some food and meat with you out of doors and there have your meal. Perchance your nephew’s spirit will see you eating and will come to you. If the spirit does come to you, don’t attempt to catch it, not even if it comes and stands at your back; but if it comes and sits on your lap, then catch it and your nephew and brothers will be restored to life again. Their spirits were on their way to the mountains to gather food.”"
"Mahope o keia mau olelo, hana aku la o Aukelenuiaiku e like me na olelo a kana wahine, ia ia e ai ana launa mai la ka uhane o ke keiki. I aku ka wahine ia Aukelenuiaiku: “E wikiwiki kau ai ana i noho paa mai ka uhane o ko keiki.” Ia Aukelenuiaiku e ai wikiwiki ana, poai mai la ka uhane o ke keiki ma kona mau aoao a pau loa, ma ke kua a ma ke alo. No keia kokoke loa o ka uhane o ua keiki la, hopu aku la o Aukelenuiaiku, ia wa, nalowale ka uhane o ke keiki.

While he was eating, the spirit of his nephew came to him. The wife then said to Aukelenuiaiku: “Be quick with your meal so that the spirit of your nephew will remain with you longer.” While Aukelenuiaiku was eating very fast, the spirit kept on going around him at his back and in front of him. As the spirit came nearer and got quite close to Aukelenuiaiku, Aukelenuiaiku attempted to catch [ ] it; when he did this it disappeared. At this his wife said: “You will not be able to save your nephew now, because you acted too hastily. Had you obeyed my instructions, he would have been brought to life again. Now the spirit of your nephew is dead.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this from his wife, he became down-hearted and believed what his wife told him, that the spirit of his nephew was now beyond recovery. Aukelenuiaiku therefore refused to take food for five days and five nights; he would not touch either food or water, and he denied himself everything, for he was so sorry for his nephew. When Namakaokahai saw her husband refuse to take food she asked him: “Why have you refused to take food?” Her husband replied: “You know quite well why I have refused food, my wife; that is, the spirit of my nephew. I will not take food until my days of grief are over; then I will again take food.”"
"No keia mea, komo mai la ke aloha i loko o ka wahine no kana kane, nolaila, olelo aku la ia i ke kane: “Aia a nui ko ikaika, ola ko keiki, a me ou kaikuaana, aka, i emi ko ikaika, aole e ola ko keiki a me ou kaikuaana.” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku i ka wahine: “Heaha ia mea a’u e hana aku ai me ka ikaika?” “O ka wai ola loa a Kane.

If you are able to procure this, then your nephew and brothers will live.” When Aukelenuiaiku heard this from his wife he took food and meat; the reason of this was because he heard that it was possible to save his nephew and brothers. After he had taken food, Aukelenuiaiku said to his wife: “Where is the road that will lead me to the water of everlasting life of Kane?” His wife replied: “I will show you the way. From this place where we are standing you must go straight to the rising sun, where you will obtain the water of everlasting life of Kane.”"
"Maanei e ike ai kakou i ko Aukelenuiaiku mana a me kona hele ana i ka aina malihini e huli i ka wai ola a Kane.

The wife then said to her husband: “On this direct line you must go without once departing from it. You must not go towards the right, for you will then be wandering in the sky and die. You must not go to the left of this line, for you will then fall into space and you will be lost. All these instructions you must keep in your mind.” As soon as his wife concluded with her instructions, Aukelenuiaiku took up the box which contained his god Lonoikoualii, put it under his arm and then put on his robe of ashes. When Aukelenuiaiku was ready to proceed on his journey, he fell on his wife’s neck and they kissed each other, and then made his flight toward the rising sun."

At the end of another month she again went out [ ] and looked, and there she saw her husband still flying. She then remained for another month, at the end of which time she again looked for her husband, but after looking in all directions she was unable to see him. After looking for some time without seeing him, she began to have fears that he must be dead for having gone outside of the straight limits directed him, and therefore he must have fallen into space. She began to weep and wail for her husband, for she loved him much. When her brothers heard the weeping they came to find out the cause. When they came in her presence, they asked her: “Why are you weeping?” “Your brother-in-law is dead.” We will here say a few words relating to the relatives of Namakaokahai and how they all mourned for Aukelenuiaiku."
"A hiki na kaikunane i mua o Namakaokahai, kena aku la ia: “E kii i na mea a pau o luna, e iho mai e kanikau no Aukelenuiaiku, oia ka po, ke ao, ka la, ka hoku, ka hekili, ke anuenue, ka uwila, ka waipuilani, ka ohu, ka ua noe, ka mahina oia o Kaukihikamalama, he kupunakane no Namakaokahai.

These were, the night, the day, the sun, the stars, the thunder, the rainbow, the lightning, the water-spout, the fog, the fine rain, the moon, Kaukihikamalama, the grandfather of Namakaokahai. “Bring them all down,” she said. “If they refuse to come to weep for my husband, I will kill them all.” After ordering her brothers to do this they proceeded on their way, and in course of a very short time everybody came, for they feared death by Namakaokahai."
"A hiki mai keia poe, kena hou aku la o Namakaokahai: “E kii i ko ka lani poe, oia keia, Kuwahailo, Makalii, Kamalanaikuaheahea, Kukuena, Mahuia, Ikuwa, Welehu.

A e olelo aku oukou i kuu kaikunane ia Makalii, pau ka hele ana mai o ka wahine maluna o ka lima o na kanaka, ina ia e hoole i keia, make ia ia’u i keia la.”","After the arrival of all these people, Namakaokahai again sent out her brothers to go and bring those who were in heaven. They were, Kuwahailo, Makalii, Kamalanaikuaheahea, Kukuena, Mahuia, Ikuwa and Welehu. “Tell all these people to come down and weep for my husband. If they refuse to come in obedience to my commands, I will kill them all. I also want you to tell my cousin Makalii, that his wife must cease coming on the hands of the people; if he disregards this, I will kill him this day.”"
"Mahope o keia mau olelo, ua makaukau na mea a pau loa, a ua akoakoa i loko o ka wa pokole. O ka hana a keia poe a pau loa, o ke kanikau i ke kane a ke ’lii wahine, oia no o Aukelenuiaiku. Ma keia kamailio ana, e hoi hou kakou e olelo no ka lele ana o Aukelenuiaiku.","In a very short time this message was delivered and the people all came together and joined in weeping for Aukelenuiaiku, the husband of their queen. We will now take up again the flight of Aukelenuiaiku."
"Ma keia lele ana o Aukelenuiaiku, aole oia i lele pono maluna o ke au o ke kaha pololei, nolaila, ua haule loa kona lele ana ma ka nenelu o ka lewa, a kokoke loa e make. A ma keia lele ana hoi, ua lolohi loa ko Aukelenuiaiku lima i ka paa i ka pahu o kona akua, o Lonoikoualii, nolaila, hoololi ae la ia ma kekahi aoao, ma keia hoololi ana, ike iho la o Lonoikoualii ke ’kua, ua haalele laua i ke au o ke kaha, kahi a Namakaokahai i olelo mai ai.

O ke kumu i puahilohilo ai o ka mahina, o ka puliki ana o Aukelenuiaiku, pela ka mea i olelo ia maloko o keia moolelo.","In this flight, Aukelenuiaiku did not fly within the straight limits given him, so he fell into space and he grew weaker and weaker until he was almost dead. In this long flight, the arm under which the box containing the god was held, became so tired that he changed the box under the other arm; in doing this the god Lonoikoualii saw for the first time that they had departed from the direct line shown them by Namakaokahai. Lonoikoualii then said to Aukelenuiaiku: “We are flying outside of the limits given us and not on the line. The fire is burning there on the earth and I see everybody has gone down below except one person.” Aukelenuiaiku asked: “Who is it that is still up here?” Lonoikoualii, his god, replied: “That thing stationed up there; fly for it and hold it fast, and then we will be saved.” The object which the god Lonoikoualii referred to was the grandfather of Namakaokahai, Kaukihikamalama, the moon. The reason why he was later than the [ ] others in obeying the summons of his granddaughter was because he was delayed in preparation of food for him on the way to the earth. But before he was ready to come he was held by Aukelenuiaiku, and because of this fact we now see the moon not quite as bright as it used to be. It was because Aukelenuiaiku held it so tightly. Anyway, that is the reason given in this story."
"A kau o Aukelenuiaiku a me Lonoikoualii i luna o ka mahina, ninau ae la ka mahina me ka hookae ia Aukelenuiaiku: “Nawai ke kupu o oe e na kanaka hookano? Aole i pii ia ko’u kua e ka’u moopuna ponoi, e Namakaokahai, a ia oe, pii ia ana ko’u kua.” “Nau no ke kupu, owau nei la.” “Na’u na wai?” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Nau no.” Olelo ae o Kaukihikamalama: “Oi ana kahi o ka pili ana?” “Owau ke keiki a Kapapaiakea laua o Iku.” I mai o Kaukihikamalama: “O ka hanai no oe a Kapoino laua o Kamooinanea?” “Ae, owau no.” I aku ka mahina: “Mai make e kuu haku.” Ma keia kamailio ana a Aukelenuiaiku me Kaukihikamalama i ka lani, ua lohe o Namakaokahai i lalo nei i ko laua olelo ana. Ia wa, akahi no a maopopo ia ia o Aukelenuiaiku keia, no ka mea, o ka inoa o Aukelenuiaiku ia lakou, o Kanakaokai. Nolaila, olelo ae la o Namakaokahai i kona makuakane, a me kona mau kaikunane: “Kupanaha! kai no he kanaka e keia, aole ka; eia no ka o Aukelenuiaiku, ke keiki a Kapapaiakea laua o Iku, ka hanai a Kapoino laua o Kamooinanea.”","When Aukelenuiaiku and Lonoikoualii landed on the moon, the moon in disgust asked of Aukelenuiaiku: “Whose conceited child are you? My back has never been climbed by my own grandchild, Namakaokahai, and here you have done it.” “I am your own child.” “Mine by whom?” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “Yours. I am the child of Kapapaiakea with Iku.” Kaukihikamalama then said: “Are you the ward of Kapoino and Kamooinanea?” “Yes, I am he.” The moon replied: “You came near being killed, my lord.” This conversation, in the heaven between Aukelenuiaiku and Kaukihikamalama, was overheard by Namakaokahai, who then knew for the first time that her husband was no other person than Aukelenuiaiku, because the name by which she knew him was Kanakaokai. Therefore she said to her father and brothers: “How strange this is! I thought that this person was somebody else altogether, but I now see it is Aukelenuiaiku, the son of Kapapaiakea with Iku, and the ward of Kapoino and Kamooinanea.”"
"Mahope o laila, kahea ae la o Namakaokahai ia Kaukihikamalama e lele mai, me ka moopuna, oia o Aukelenuiaiku. A hoi mai la o Aukelenuiaiku i ka honua, kena ae la o Namakaokahai i na mea hoomalamalama a pau loa e lele i luna o ka lani, i malamalama o Aukelenuiaiku ke hoi mai, oia ka la, ke ao, ka uwila, ke ahi.","After this, Namakaokahai called out to Kaukihikamalama to come to her with his grandson Aukelenuiaiku. When Aukelenuiaiku was returning to the earth, Namakaokahai commanded that all the different lights return to their respective stations in the heaven so as to give Aukelenuiaiku light by which to return to earth; these being the sun, the daylight, the lightning and the fire. When Aukelenuiaiku again reached the earth the people all cried for joy. After the weeping, Kuwahailo, Makalii, Kamalanaikuaheahea, Kaukihikamalama and the others prepared to return to heaven."
"A hiki o Aukelenuiaiku i lalo nei, uwe iho la lakou, a pau ka uwe ana, makaukau o Kuwahailo, Makalii, Malanaikuaheahea, Kaukihikamalama, e hoi. A pau lakou i ka hoi i luna o ka lani, noho iho la o Aukelenuiaiku me Namakaokahai he manawa loihi loa, ma ke ano o ke kane a me ka wahine; a mahope o laila olelo aku o Namakaokahai i ke kane: “E imi hou ae oe i ka wai ola loa a Kane.” Ae aku o Aukelenuiaiku i keia olelo a kana wahine, alaila, olelo aku o Namakaokahai: “Ke hoomoe nei au i keia auhau, mai ka puka o ka hale o kaua a ka hikina a ka la, nolaila, e nana pono oe me ka malama loa. Maanei oe e hele ai, mai keia kihi a kela kihi, maluna pono o ke au o ka aina a me ke kaha pololei loa, mai lele oe ma keia aoao, a ma kela aoao, o make oe. ”","After the return of their friends, Aukelenuiaiku and Namakaokahai for a long time remained by themselves, as husband and wife. After this, however, Namakaokahai said to her husband: “You must make another search for the water of everlasting life of Kane.” Aukelenuiaiku agreed to this. Namakaokahai then said to him: “I want you to watch the course you are to go by. From the door of our house in a straight line to the rising sun, and I want you to remember this: that you must go over this course from one end to the other, and you must not go outside of these limits, for if you do you will die.” At the close of the instructions, Aukelenuiaiku again began his second flight toward heaven. At the end of the long flight he stood on the edge of a hole, in the bottom of which was kept the water of everlasting life of Kane. The journey was only completed, however, after a flight of six months."
"A pau ke kamailio ana a Namakaokahai ia Aukelenuiaiku, lele aku la ia i ka lani, a ku ma ke kae o ka lua, aia i lalo o ia lua ka wai ola loa a Kane. O ka loihi nae, o ka manawa o ka lele ana, eono mahina.

When Aukelenuiaiku [ ] saw him he flew and lit on the back of the guard. While Aukelenuiaiku was perched on his back, he asked in anger and hatred: “Say, you are awfully conceited! Whose conceited child are you? My back has never been climbed by my grandchild Kamohoalii, and here you have come and done it.” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “Your own.” “Mine by whom?” “I am the child of Kapapaiakea and Iku.” “Are you the grandchild of Kapoino and Kamooinanea?” “Yes,” said Aukelenuiaiku."
"A lohe kela i keia mau olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, aloha mai la ia: “E walina hoi ia oe e kuu haku. Heaha kau huakai o ka hiki ana mai?” Olelo aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “I kii mai nei au i ka wai ola loa a Kane, no kuu keiki a me o’u kaikuaana.” Ninau mai o Kanenaiau: “Ua pau loa nae paha?” I aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Aole i pau.” I mai la kela: “Nana ia i kuu piko.” Ia Aukelenuiaiku e nana ana i ka piko, kuhikuhi mai la kela i ke ala e lele ai. “Auhea oe, mai lele ma keia aoao o pa oe i ka ohe, no ka mea, ina e pa ka ohe, o ka halulu no ia o ka ohe, a lohe ko kaikuaana, paa ka wai, aole e loaa mai ia oe. Nolaila, maanei oe e lele ai, alaila, loaa ia oe ka wai ola loa a Kane.”","When the guard heard these words from Aukelenuiaiku, he greeted him, saying: “My greetings to you, my lord. What has brought you here?” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “I have come for the water of everlasting life of Kane, for my nephew and my brothers.” Kanenaiau then asked: “Isn’t it all gone?” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “No, it is not all gone.” Kanenaiau said: “Look at my middle.” While Aukelenuiaiku was looking at the middle of Kanenaiau, he was instructed as to the course by which he was to fly, as follows: “Where art thou, don’t fly on this side, for you will strike the bamboo growing in this place; if you strike the bamboo, the sound will reach the ears of your cousin, and the water will be covered up and you will not get it. You must therefore fly on this side and you will be able to get the water of everlasting life of Kane.”"
"A pau ka olelo ana ia Aukelenuiaiku, mahope o laila, lele aku la o Aukelenuiaiku a kau ana i luna o Hawewe. E like me na olelo i kela mau mea i hala aku, pela no ka olelo ana maanei. I mai o Hawewe: “E kuu haku, heaha kau huakai o ka hiki ana mai?” “I hele mai au e imi i ka wai ola a Kane.” Ia wa, olelo mai o Hawewe: “Mai lele oe ma ka aoao hema, o pa auanei ka lama ia oe, halulu, o ia halulu a lohe ko kaikuaana i lalo, loaa ole ka wai ola a Kane ia oe.

O ka nui a me ka loihi o ka manawa o Aukelenuiaiku i lele ai, mai ke kanaka mua a keia kanaka hope elua mahina o ka lele ana.","At the end of these instructions Aukelenuiaiku continued on his flight. After flying for some time he saw and lit on Hawewe, when the same questions were asked relating to Aukelenuiaiku’s connections to him. Hawewe asked: “My lord, what is your object in coming here?” “I have come in search of the water of life of Kane.” Hawewe then answered: “You must not fly on the left side, else you will strike the lama trees, and the sound will reach the ears of your cousin below, and you will never be able to get the water of life of Kane. You must therefore fly on this side, then you will get what you wish.” These two men were the granduncles of Aukelenuiaiku on the side of his mother, Kapapaiakea. The time consumed by Aukelenuiaiku in his flight from the first man to the second man was two months."
"A haalele o Aukelenaiaiku i ke kamailio ana me Hawewe, lele hou mai la o Aukelenuiaiku a kau i luna o Kanenaenae.

At the end of the questions and answers relating to the parents of Aukelenuiaiku, Kanenaenae then knew that he was connected to Aukelenuiaiku, and he therefore fell on him and wept. At the end of the weeping he asked Aukelenuiaiku: “What has brought my lord here?” Aukelenuiaiku answered: “I have come for the water of everlasting life of Kane, for my nephew and brothers.” Kanenaenae then asked: “Is it not all gone?” “No, it is not all gone.” “Yes, you shall have it. Look straight at my middle.” While Aukelenuiaiku was looking, Kanenaenae said: “You must not fly on this side, for you will strike the loulu palm leaves and the sound will travel to your cousin there below, and the water of life of Kane will be closed and you will not be able to get it. You must therefore fly along this way. In this flight downward you will meet your grandfather who will direct you how to get to this water of life.” [ ]"

After the several questions had been asked and the usual answers given, Aukelenuiaiku said: “I am your own offspring.” The guard then asked: “Mine by whom?” “I am the child of Kapapaiakea and Iku.” When Kuemanu heard this he wept over Aukelenuiaiku and then asked: “Are you the grandson of Kapoino and Kamooinanea?” Aukelenuiaiku assented, saying: “Yes, I am their grandchild.” Kuemanu then asked: “What thing of such importance is it that has brought you here?” Aukelenuiaiku replied: “I have come in search of the water of everlasting life of Kane, for my nephew and brothers.” “Yes, you shall get it. You must go down to your grandaunt, who is down there at the base of the cliff, Luahinekaikapu, who is blind. When you come to her, you will find her roasting bananas, four in number. When she reaches out to take one up, you also reach and take one; do this until the last ones are taken. Then when she reaches out for the others and fails to find them and asks, ‘What mischievous fellow is this that has come?’ and receives no reply, she will take up the ashes and sprinkle them to her right; you must then run over to her left side. And when she sprinkles the ashes on her left side, you must run to her right side. After this you want to watch her as she takes up the ashes and smells of it. If she should do this, then she will discover you; then be very careful or the old woman will kill you. Look out for another attack, for she will then take up one of her clubs which is used for beating kapas and strike at you with it, when you must run to her left side; and when she strikes to her left, run to her right. After you have overcome all these things, then you must run and climb on to her back and sit there.”"

I have no eyes; I am blind; I cannot see. I may not be able to give you the water of everlasting life of Kane.” By these words of his grandaunt, Aukelenuiaiku began to be doubtful about getting what he wished, and for a moment he did not know what to do. At last he said to his grandaunt: “Let us go outside.” When she heard this she assented and she was led out by Aukelenuiaiku and was made to lie down under a coconut tree. Aukelenuiaiku then climbed up the coconut tree and picked off two young shoots of the [ ] coconut, and then called to his grandaunt: “Say, Luahinekaikapu, turn your face toward the sky.” When the old woman heard this she turned her face up as directed. Aukelenuiaiku then threw with much force the two young shoots at the eyes of Luahinekaikapu. When these struck her in the eyes, she jumped up and cried with a loud voice: “Oh! I am killed.” Aukelenuiaiku then called out to her: “Don’t cry, be quiet; rub your eyes, they may open up and you will then be able to see.” When the old woman heard this call from her grandchild, she began rubbing her eyes. After doing this her sight was restored and she was able to see as before. Aukelenuiaiku then called out to her: “How are your eyes?” “I can see now.” After this Aukelenuiaiku climbed down the tree."
"Olelo aku o Luahinekaikapu ia ia: “E kii oe i ka pohuehue a me ka akoko,” a loaa mai la ia mau mea i mua o ke alo o kona kupunawahine, kui iho la ia me ka nanahu, ke kukui, ka lepo, a wali; a pau loa keia mau mea i ka akoakoa.

She then took and pounded them together with some charcoal, kukui nut and dirt, until the whole mess became soft. The old woman then said to her grandchild: “We will now proceed to fix you up.” By this the old woman meant that she was to paint or rub the stuff prepared by her on the hands of Aukelenuiaiku so as to make them look like the hands of Kamohoalii."
"Mahope o keia mau mea, pena iho la o Luahinekaikapu i ka lima o Aukelenuiaiku a eleele loa, i like me ko Kamohoalii lima ka eleele; no ka mea, o ka poe nana i kiai ka wai ola a Kane, ua maa lakou i ka eleele o ka lima, no ka mea, o ka wai ua paa i ka pulama ia me na kiai, a o ka lima i paele ole ia a lalau, aole e loaa mai ka wai.","After these things the hands of Aukelenuiaiku were painted black so that they looked like the hands of Kamohoalii, for the guards who had the keeping of the water of life of Kane knew that the hands of Kamohoalii were black. The water of life of Kane was being watched by certain men, and any hands that reached down that were not black would not be able to receive the water."

[ ]","After the hands of Aukelenuiaiku had been blackened the grandaunt said to him: “We will sit here until the preparation of the awa is finished, when you must approach the opening. When you get to the opening, reach in with your hands. The first gourd they will give you contains the bitter water; throw that away and reach in again, and when they hand you the second gourd, that one contains the water of life of Kane; bring that with you.” Aukelenuiaiku then followed these instructions and approached the opening of the place in which the water of life of Kane was kept. After waiting for a moment Aukelenuiaiku reached in with his hands. When the guards saw these hands reaching in they were surprised, for they had never seen such a thing before. Being surprised, they hesitated for a while to study what they should do. The guards then took up some food and placed it into the hands of Aukelenuiaiku, but the hands dropped the food; they then placed some fish in the hands, and still the fish was dropped. The guards then wondered what the hand was reaching for. Finally one of the guards said: “Perhaps the hands are after the water of life of Kane.” One of the other guards thought that this was possible, so the gourd called Huawaiakaula, which held the water of life of Kane, was taken up and placed into the hands of Aukelenuiaiku."
"A loaa ka huewai ia Aukelenuiaiku lawe ae la ia a luna, hahaki ae la ia i ka nuku o ka huewai, ninini iho la i ka wai i loko o kona huewai, a mokumoku ae la i ka aha, o ka huewai oia o Paleaikaahalanalana.

Nolaila, haku iho la ia i mele aloha no kona kaikaina. Penei ua mele la:","When the gourd was given to Aukelenuiaiku, he came up with it; then he broke off the neck and poured the water into his own gourd; then he proceeded and [ ] broke the network of strings that held the gourd. This network was called Paleaikaahalanalana. After doing all this, Aukelenuiaiku began on his flight out of the hole, flying in a direction away from his grandaunt, Luahinekaikapu. But the grandaunt saw all this, and so she wept for her sister, Kamooinanea and her brother Lonoikoualii. She then recited the following mele, one of love for her sister:"
"“Kuhi aku au i Napili, I ke ala a Kanemakua i hele mai ai, Ka haku, ka lauoho o Kuliliikaua, He kanaka no o Lono e! He hopu manawa no Ulaula i ke ahi, He kaua ia Kuluheiua, Make ai ua loku, Hee ai na paka, O ka ua kilikili ka, O ka ua hoomau Hoomau ka ua i Kamakalana, Pili i ka hulu o Maui, Poowai o Ikumailani.

Lono is human indeed, For he has at times caught Ulaula, the fire, And has fought against Kuluheiua, Killed the heavy rain And routed the rain drops, The fine rain, The continuous rain That fell constantly at Kamakalana, Adjoining the forest belt of Maui, Headwaters of Ikumailani. There is a season, a season of endearment, A season, a season when they become parted. Cut the navel and its cord is severed. Art thou the one? Awake, O Lono! The earth above here is thine, O Kane, Where the waters are drawn up from the ocean, And are again sprinkled by Lonowaimakua. O ye rains! O ye rains!! How I grieve for you two as you drift by, How I long for the wind that blows the fine rain of Kuaihelani.”"

[ ]","While she was weeping and chanting the mele, Aukelenuiaiku was still flying. On this return flight he got tangled in the lama trees and the sound of the broken lama was carried below to the ears of Kamohoalii. When Kamohoalii heard the sound he woke up from his sleep and listened, trying to ascertain the cause of the sound, but after listening for two months no further sound reached him there below. Aukelenuiaiku on the other hand continued on with his flight until he again got tangled up with the loulu palm leaves, and again the sound was carried down below to Kamohoalii. After getting out of the loulu grove he continued on with his flight until he got into the bamboo grove, and the sound of the breaking of the bamboo was carried down to Kamohoalii. By this time Aukelenuiaiku had reached the top of the hole. [ ]"
"Maanei, e hoomaha uuku iho kakou i ka olelo a me ka hoolohe no Aukelenuiaiku, a e hoolohe kakou no Kamohoalii. Ia Aukelenuiaiku i hiki ai i kahi o ka lama e ku ana, ua hiki aku ke o ana o ka lama i na pepeiao o Kamohoalii, aka, ua kakali oia no ka hiki aku a hala elua mahina.

When Aukelenuiaiku entered the lama grove and he became entangled with the trees, the sound of the breaking lama was carried to the ears of Kamohoalii, but not being certain as to the direction from which the sound came, he listened for two months. At the end of the two months he heard the sound of the breaking of the loulu palm leaves, so Kamohoalii knew that the person who had entered these groves was traveling from the bottom of the hole upwards. This he was quite sure, because the sound of the loulu palm leaves was like the sound of thunder; the lama was like the sound of a shell, and the sound of the bamboo was like the beating of the waves against a cliff. By these different sounds and the rotation in which they sounded, Kamohoalii was able to know that the person was on his way out of the hole. Therefore he enquired of those who were guarding the water-gourd, Huawaiakaula: “Where is the water-gourd and the net outside of the gourd?” The guard replied: “You came and took it some time ago.” Kamohoalii then said to them: “I did not come for it.”"
"Mahope o keia olelo ana, lele aku la o Kamohoalii a loaa o Kuemanu, ke kiai o ka lewa, ninau aku la ia: “Aole anei oe i ike i ke kanaka kalohe?” I mai la o Kuemanu: “Ua ike au malalo mai nei, o ko kaikaina o Aukelenuiaiku, i kii mai nei i wai ola no ke keiki a me na kaikuaana.” A lohe o Kamohoalii, olelo aku la ia: “He kanaka hana ino ia. Aole ia o ka hana pono ana a ke kaikaina; o ka hele mai a launa, he alo he alo, kamailio pono ana, eia ka kana ke kii aihue. Aole au ahewa no kona lawe ana i ka wai ola, eia wale no, no ka hana ino ana ona i ke kupunawahine o maua ia Huewaiakaula, a me ke kupunakane o maua o Paleaikaahalanalana.” Eia ke ano, o ka hahahi i ka nuku o ka huewai, o ka mokumoku ana i ka aha o waho e paa ai.","After this Kamohoalii flew up until he met Kuemanu, one of the guards on the way up, and asked him: “Have you seen the mischievous man?” Kuemanu replied: “I saw him coming up from below; he is your cousin Aukelenuiaiku, who came for the water of life of Kane for his nephew and older brothers.” When Kamohoalii heard this, he said: “He is a wicked fellow. That is not the proper thing for a cousin to do; he should have come and seen me on the matter, and not steal it. I don’t blame him for taking the water of life, but he has ill-used our grandmother, Huawaiakaula, and our grandfather Paleaikalanalana.” This was because Aukelenuiaiku had broken off the neck of the water gourd, and also pulled to pieces the network of strings that served as the covering."
"A pau kana kamailio ana me Kuemanu, ia wa o Kamohoalii i hao ai i kona mana ma ka lele, aole o kana mai o ka lele, me ko Kamohoalii manao e loaa o Aukelenuiaiku, alaila, hana ma ka aoao keiki kane.

When Kamohoalii reached the top of the hole, he asked of the guard, Kanenaiau: “Have you seen the man that came up from below?” “I have seen him, and it was Aukelenuiaiku, your cousin.” “How long ago since he passed here?” “One year and six months.” When Kamohoalii heard this he seized Kekuaokalani’s stick, Hoolehelehekii, and returned to the bottom of the hole."
"A hiki o Aukelenuiaiku i ka moana i make ai ke keiki, me na kaikuaana, nini iho la ia i ka wai ola i loko o ke kai a kokoke e pau ka wai, he hapalua paha ke koe. Ia Aukelenuiaiku e nini ana, ike aku la o Namakaokahai i ke kane e nini ana i luna o ke kai, aole nae he ola o ke keiki a me na kaikuaana. Kahea aku la ka wahine: “E Aukelenuiaiku e, hoi mai.” A hiki mai la o Aukelenuiaiku, olelo aku ka wahine: [ ] “Halaoa oe e ke kane.” Ke ano o ia, mahaoi oe e ke kane. Wahi a ka wahine: “Kai no o ka imi kau a loaa na’u e hana aku, alaila, ola ko keiki me ou kaikuaana. Aole ka! O ka hoi mai no kau a hana naaupo; e pau loa aku la ka wai, aole e ola ko keiki a me ou kaikuaana.”","When Aukelenuiaiku arrived at that part of the ocean where his nephew and older brothers were destroyed, he poured out the water of life into the sea until it was almost all gone, leaving only about half of the water. While Aukelenuiaiku was pouring out the water of life, Namakaokahai saw her husband doing this, and she knew that the restoration of the nephew and brothers was not succeeding. She therefore called out: “Say, Aukelenuiaiku, come home.” When Aukelenuiaiku arrived in the [ ] presence of his wife, she said: “You are very foolish, my husband. It was for you to go in search of the water, and when you had found it I would use it, and in so doing bring back to life your nephew and older brothers. But instead of this, you have come back and acted ignorantly. Had you poured out all the water, your nephew and older brothers could never have been restored to life.”"
"Eia ka mea hou, ia Aukelenuiaiku i hiki ai ma ka hale, a launa me ka mea aloha he wahine, mahope olaila, hanau ka laua keiki, oia o Kauilanuimakaehaikalani. Elua ano o ke keiki, he ano akua, a he ano kanaka. Ma ke ano o ua keiki la, he pohaku mai luna o ke poo a lalo o na wawae, a ma ke alo hoi, he kanaka mai luna a lalo o ke kino.","Soon after this they entered the house, and Namakaokahai was confined and a child was born to them, and he was named Kauilanuimakaehaikalani. This child had two natures, the nature of a god and of a human being. The appearance of the child at the back was like a rock, that is, from the head to the feet; but in front it had the appearance of a human being."
"I aku o Namakaokahai i ke kane: “Ho mai na’u e hoola ko keiki, a me ou mau kaikuaana.” Ae mai la o Aukelenuiaiku. Holo aku la lakou a ka moana i make nui ai, lana iho la lakou i laila.

Alaila, huli aku la lakou a nana i hope, aia hoi e ku mai ana ka moku ia manawa, a e pii ana na kanaka i luna o na kia, e lawelawe ana i ke kaula me na pea.","After the confinement Namakaokahai said to her husband: “Let me bring back your nephew and older brothers to life again.” Aukelenuiaiku gave his consent to this, and they set out to that part of the ocean where the brothers and nephew of Aukelenuiaiku had been destroyed and there they stopped. Namakaokahai then said to her husband: “Pour out some of the water of life in the hollow of your hand, and I will sprinkle it into the sea.” Aukelenuiaiku did as he was requested. Namakaokahai then dipped the end of her finger into the water and sprinkled it into the sea. After this they returned to the shore without looking back. On reaching land they turned and looked back and, lo and behold! there stood the ship; and they saw the men climbing up the masts folding the sails and coiling the ropes."
"Mahope nae o ka pae ana o Aukelenuiaiku ma i uka, olelo aku o Aukelenuiaiku i ka laua keiki ponoi me Namakaokahai, oia o Kauilanuimakaehaikalani: “E! i pae mai ou makuakane me ko kaikuaana, a i hakaka olua ea, mai olelo ino oe, no ka mea, he keiki leo kapu, he keike punahele, pane ka leo, make ke kanaka, kau i ka lele, no ka mea, o’u kaikuaana la, he manene wale ke lohe i na olelo pono ole, nolaila, e noho malie loa oe, mai pane iki, o ka noho oluolu ko olua pono, pela hoi makou, ko olua mau makua.” Ma keia mau olelo a ka makuakane, he ae wale no ka ke keiki.","After Aukelenuiaiku and the others had landed, Aukelenuiaiku said to his son, Kauilanuimakaehaikalani: “When your uncles and cousin come ashore and you should have a quarrel with your cousin, don’t use bad words, because he is a boy whose very words are sacred; he is a great favorite, and his very words are to be obeyed, even to death and the offering on the altar. My older brothers themselves are very touchy upon hearing words not altogether proper; so I want you to be very quiet; don’t answer back, but be at peace with one another. This will also be the course of your parents.” Upon hearing these words from his father, the boy promised to do as he was told."
"Ia Aukelenuiaiku e olelo ana no ke keiki, pae mai la na kaikuaana a me ke keiki i uka o ka aina. Uwe iho la lakou a pau me ke aloha, hoi aku la a ka hale noho iho la. Mai ka make ana, a ke ola hou ana, ekolu makahiki ka loihi. Mahope o ko lakou hui ana, haawi aku o Aukelenuiaiku i ka aina a pau i na kaikuaana.","While Aukelenuiaiku was cautioning his son, the older brothers and nephew came ashore where they all met and wept over each other, and after their greeting they went to the house and settled down. The length of time from their death until the bringing back to life of these people was three years."
"Eia ka lua, o ka wahine o Namakaokahai, haawi aku la ia i kona mau kaikuaana, o lakou ka mea mana maluna o ka wahine, me lakou ka moe ana, ka hele ana, ka noho ana. Penei ke ano o ka wahine i na kaikuaana; hookahi po, hookahi ao, e moe ai me kekahi kaikuaana, pela a pau like lakou, aka, o ko lakou mua loa, oia o Kekamakahinuiaiku ke kaikuaana huhu o Aukelenuiaiku, elua ona po, elua ao e moe ai me ka wahine a lakou, alaila pau. [ ]","After they had lived together for some time, Aukelenuiaiku gave all his lands to his brothers, and furthermore he also gave them his wife, Namakaokahai, and they virtually had all the say about her, and they slept with her, traveled with her and lived with her. The brothers took turns with the wife in this way: first one brother would have her for a day and a night, then the next brother would have her for a day and a night, and so on down; but the older brother, Kekamakahainuiaiku, the one who hated Aukelenuiaiku, had a double portion; that is, he took their wife for two days and two nights at a time. [ ]"
"Mai ka hoomaka ana o keia moolelo e malama ia a hiki i keia la, owai la ka mea like me ka mea hala ole me Aukelenuiaiku ka haawi wale aku i kona punawai momona no hai? Aole he mea like.","From the time in which this legend deals until today, who can be compared with Aukelenuiaiku for his great liberal nature in giving away his own possessions and even his wife to others? There is none like him."
"Maloko o keia mau olelo haawi a Aukelenuiaiku i ka aina a me ka wahine, aohe ona kuleana pono i koe, ua lilo ia i kuewa hoopili wale. Ia ia e noho haahaa ana, hookahi ana hana, he kamakoi ma na lae kahakai i na manawa a pau loa, a ua lilo loa ia i mea makaukau ia hana. Ia ia e hana mau ana i ke kamakoi, ua halawai mai o Pele laua o Hiiaka me ia, he mau kaikaina laua no Namakaokahai. Ia lakou e halawai ana ma kahi o Aukelenuiaiku e kamakoi ana, ua hoalualu loa ia ko Aukelenuiaiku manao e ko laua mau helehelena kino, oia o Pele a me Hiiaka. A he mea poina ole i ko Aukelenuiaiku manao ko Pele helehelena a me ko Hiiaka; ua lilo ia mea he mea hana ino i ka manao, a he mea hiaa loa i ka noho ana ma ka hale.","In thus giving away his wife and lands, Aukelenuiaiku reserved nothing for himself, and he therefore became like a dependent. While living in this humble way his one occupation was to go down to the seashore daily with a rod and spend his time fishing, and in time he became an expert. In his daily trips out rod fishing he often met Pele and Hiiaka, cousins of Namakaokahai. In their meetings Aukelenuiaiku began to admire the two girls, and he spent more of his time with them than he did at fishing. In time Aukelenuiaiku could do but very little fishing, for the desire to see the two girls, Pele and Hiiaka, was his greatest pleasure, and after a time he became infatuated with them and thought of very little else but the features of Pele and Hiiaka, and he found himself oftener with them than anywhere else."
"Ma ka olelo mua a kakou i olelo ae nei, ua lilo loa o Namakaokahai i na kaikuaana, a ua nele o Aukelenuiaiku i ka wahine ole, aka, o ko Namakaokahai manao, aole i pau kona aloha ia Aukelenuiaiku, e mau ana no e like me mamua.

Nolaila, hoolalau ka Aukelenuiaiku hana i ke aho, ka makau, ke kamakoi, e hamo ai me ka lohi au, a me ka apa.

A no ka maloo ole o ke aho, ua lilo ia i mea na kana wahine e noonoo ai. No keia mea ua lilo ia i mea kaumaha no Aukelenuiaiku.","We have seen that Namakaokahai had altogether become the property of his brothers, and that Aukelenuiaiku was without a wife; but Namakaokahai never forgot Aukelenuiaiku; she loved him still and held him as dear to her as before. At nights while at home, Aukelenuiaiku thought of nothing else but his two companions, and so each morning he would take up his line, hook and rod, and pretend to be very busy with them as though they needed overhauling. In doing this Aukelenuiaiku wanted to make his wife, Namakaokahai, believe that he was really very much taken up with his pastime, that of fishing, and in that way keep his wife from suspecting him. Aukelenuiaiku was absent once for three whole days on one of his fishing trips, and the wife began to suspect that something was wrong. Before this it was his usual custom to go out early in the morning, and after dark would come home; but this time he forgot to dry out his fish-line as before. When his wife saw this she became suspicious, and knowing that his wife knew his neglect about drying out his fish-line, he was very much depressed."
"A hala keia la, hiki hou mai kekahi la, he mea mau no ko Aukelenuiaiku iho ana i ka makoikoi i kai, a hiki i ke ahiahi, hoi aku la me ka wahine. Mamua ae nae o kona hoi ana me ka wahine, hou iho la i ke aho a me ka makau i loko o ka wai, i mea e manao mai ai ka wahine i ka lawaia.

I aku ka wahine: “Kupanaha oe, po ka la ke hele, o na wahi ia iho la no ia.”","The day after this Aukelenuiaiku as usual took up his rod and proceeded to the seashore; and toward evening he returned home. Before he started home, however, he soaked his fish-line and hook into the water so as to make his wife believe that he had really been fishing. When Aukelenuiaiku arrived at the house, he began to arrange his hook and line, and as he was at it for some time, his wife said: “It would be all right to be constantly occupied with your hook and line if you caught any fish; then those at home would get some. Here you do nothing else but work on your hook and line, and yet you never bring any fish home. What a waste of time!” The husband replied: “Do you think, my wife, that the fish is something you can catch with your hands in the sea so that I could bring them home all the time? Don’t you know that the line and hook are all I have in the matter, and not the bringing of the fish? That is entirely with the fish whether to bite at my hook or not.” Shortly after this conversation Aukelenuiaiku again started out fishing, and late that evening he returned with two small fish called aloiloi. The wife then said to him: “How strange of you to go all day and return at night, and these are all the fish you bring home!” [ ]"
"A hele hou o Aukelenuiaiku i ka lawaia, loaa hou ia ia ka apiki ma keia hele ana. Ua pau loa kona kino i ke nahu ia, a o kona ai, ua uwau ia a weluwelu, a ahiahi, hoi mai la me na wahi ia elua.

His body was bitten all over, while his neck was all scratched up, and in places it was cut. On this evening he again came home with two more small fish. On reaching the house Namakaokahai looked at her husband’s body and neck and saw that he was all scratched. She then spoke in parables saying: “Yes, there are two kinds of fish in the sea that bite: the shark and the eel.” Then she continued: “Strange, that your skin is all bitten and your neck scratched, but you don’t return with any sharks and eels.” Aukelenuiaiku then said with great cunning: “I met with a queer experience today. When I arrived at the seashore I tied the bait to my hook and cast it into the sea. After I had let the line down it got caught in the coral down below, and so I dived down and after getting the line loose I came up. I was not at all hurt at this time. But on casting my line the second time it again got tangled and I dived the second time. After this it was caught the third time and again I went down, but before I had gone very far I got the cramps and I was carried by the current away down to the bottom where I was rubbed against the coral until my back was all cut up. After this I recovered myself and swam up, and this time I was caught in an eel hole, and there I was rolled about by the surf until I was almost out of breath. Had I been a boy from the backwoods I would have been killed, and you would not have known how, and how pitiful that would have been.”"
"Ma keia kamailio ana, ua maopopo loa i na Anekelope maka palupalu a pau loa, e nana ana i keia moolelo, he kalohe io no o Aukelenuiaiku. A ua pili mai no ia hana mua i ka poe o neia mau la e hooipoipo ana, a nolaila he hana no ia a ke keiki Aukelenuiaiku e loaa ana i kona mau hooilina o keia mau la hope nei. A maanei no hoi e ike ai kakou i ko ka wahine puni ole.","To those who may be reading this story, it is plain to all the fair sex that Aukelenuiaiku was a deceiver, and that his scratches and bites came from another source altogether. The trait, however, will be found in his descendants in these latter days. And here we see that his wife was not to be deceived by him."
"Ma keia mau olelo a Aukelenuiaiku, aohe nalowale i kana wahine, ia Namakaokahai. I aku ka wahine: “E maalea, kuhi ana anei oe he naaupo au, i kau mau hana, a me kau mau olelo hoopunipuni? Ua maopopo ia’u, he wahine kau o kai e iho mau nei oe i na la a pau loa. Nolaila, eia ko’u manao ia oe: “E noa ko kino ia hai, mawaho, a o ka ili a me ka io, na’u ia na ka mea waiwai, aole o’u makemake e uwau, a e hana ino ia oe.”","With all Aukelenuiaiku’s smooth words, his wife did not believe him. She then said to him: “Say, cunning, do you think I am a fool, and am not aware of your doings and your deceit? I know that you have a woman whom you go down every day to see. So here is what I wish to say to you: The outside of your body is free to others, but your skin and flesh are my property, and I do not want to have you scratched and ill-treated.”"
"Ma keia mau olelo a ka wahine, heaha la ia ia Aukelenuiaiku, he mea ole. Hoomau aku la no ia i ka iho i ke kamakoi, a ma keia iho hou ana a Aukelenuiaiku, a hoi mai aohe kino i koe i ka uwau a me ke nahu ia, a pela me ka ai i ka uwau ia.

When Aukelenuiaiku came back from his next trip his body was scratched and bitten all over and his neck was cut in several places. When Namakaokahai saw how her husband was all cut up, [ ] and how he had disregarded her words of advice, she grew less angry of him and transferred all her anger to her cousins, Pele and Hiiaka."

When Namakaokahai’s anger was aroused she seized her cousins and gave them a severe beating. When the brothers saw this they jumped in to help the girls, but this interference was of no avail, for Namakaokahai gave her brothers some of the beating, and she gave them so much that they all had a hard time to save themselves. Because of this the cousins rose and departed to some other place to dwell; but Namakaokahai followed them and again drove them away. The cousins in the meantime thought that she would forget the cause of her anger, but she followed after them and drove them away from their new home. At this persistency on their cousin’s part, they vowed that they would never again turn back, nor ever again live in the same land with their cousin. At this expulsion, the two sisters studied where they would move to, and after considering several places they decided on Kauai and there make their future home. In this journey, when they reached Kauai, where they made their home, they had an idea that their cousin would leave them in peace and not follow them up. The place where Pele and Hiiaka took up as their first home on Kauai was at Puukapele, a place to the east of Mana. When they settled at this place they started a fire whose glare was seen from the high peaks in the land of Nuumealani, where Namakaokahai was stationed on the lookout for her cousins. The height of these peaks was probably as high as that of Kaala mountain."
"Ia Pele ma e ho-a ana i ke ahi a ike o Namakaokahai, ia wa no o Namakaokahai i hiki ai i Kauai a hakaka me na kaikaina; ma keia hakaka ana kokoke e lanakila o Pele ma laua o Hiiaka, aka, no ka nui loa o ko Namakaokahai ikaika, ua pio laua ia la. Nolaila, kipaku ia mai laua mai Kauai mai, a hele a noho i Oahu. No keia hakaka ana ua kapa ia kela aina o Puukapele a hiki i keia la.","When Namakaokahai saw the glare of the fire on Kauai, she knew that Pele and Hiiaka were there, so she followed on to Kauai where she met her cousins and another fight was had. In this fight Pele and Hiiaka almost overcame their cousin, but being possessed of great strength Namakaokahai was enabled to overcome her cousins. Therefore, being driven from their Kauai home, they journeyed on to Oahu where they settled. Because of the fight that took place on Kauai, the land in which it occurred was called Puukapele, and it is so to this day."
"Mahope o keia haalele ana ia Kauai, hele mai la o Pele laua o Hiiaka a noho i Kealiapaakai ma Moanalua, Oahu, malaila laua i eli iho ai a kaka i ka lepo, a noho iho la ma laila.

[ ]","Upon their arrival on Oahu, Pele and Hiiaka took up their abode in Kealiapaakai, at Moanalua, where they dug down into the ground and made a home. On coming from Kauai they brought some red dirt and some salt with them and deposited these things in their new home. Because of this fact these places were given the names of Kealiapaakai and Kealiamanu. Upon finding that the place was too shallow they went to settle at Leahi. While living at Leahi they tried digging down into the place, but again found it too shallow. The two then moved on to Molokai and settled down at Kalaupapa. After a time they began digging and were again disappointed in striking water; so they left Molokai. The hole they dug was called Kauhako. From Molokai they journeyed to Haleakala in Maui. Upon their arrival at this place they began digging a pit which they left open on the top of the mountain. The rocks in Hanakaieie, at Kahikinui, are those that were dug up by Pele and Hiiaka. [ ]"

After Pele and Hiiaka had been driven away from Kauai, through the terrible fight that took place, Namakaokahai returned to Nuumealani, and proceeded to the highest peak where she could see Maui. While Namakaokahai was living on Nuumealani, she again saw Pele and Hiiaka starting a fire on the mountain on Maui, so she left Nuumealani and came to Maui where another battle was fought in which Pele was killed. Namakaokahai then returned to the peaks on Nuumealani. After a time she looked towards Hawaii and saw Pele’s fire burning on Mauna Loa. But Namakaokahai discontinued her warfare against Pele and Hiiaka."

Pele was indeed really killed in the battle that was fought on Maui with her cousin, but she traveled in spirit to Hawaii, at which place she again came back to life. It was Pele and Hiiaka that dug that pit at Kilauea, on the slope of the Mauna Loa mountain, and this place has become their own to this day, and no one will dare dispute their claim. After the death of Pele, Namakaokahai returned to her own land in Kalakeenuiakane where she lived with her husbands and son and nephew."

The cause of the quarrel was this: The forehead of Kauilanuimakaehaikalani was cuffed by his cousin, the son of of the oldest brother of Aukelenuiaiku, the one whose every word was sacred. A few words in explanation regarding the two boys. One of these boys was human and the other, Kauilanuimakaehaikalani, was god-like. In their fight Kauilanuimakaehaikalani said to his cousin:"
"“Ka poe make iki, He poe ai oukou na ka ilo, He poe iwi kuakea, Na ko’u mau makua oukou i hoola, He poe oukou a moe ana i lalo o ke kai; Ua popo na maka.”","“You are a lot that for a time were dead, You were food for the maggots; You are a lot whose bones were whitened. It was my parents that brought you back to life, You were a lot that were asleep in the bottom of the sea With eyes all rotted.”"

When their youngest brother and wife saw that the brothers were about to depart, they entreated them not to leave them, but the brothers would not listen. After they were ready for their journey they boarded their ship and set sail for Kuaihelani; but in mid-ocean they encountered disaster and all sunk to the bottom of the sea."
"A liuliu ko laua noho ana, he kane a he wahine, a mahope o keia noho oluolu ana, nonoi aku o Aukelenuiaiku i kana wahine o Namakaokahai, penei: “E kuu wahine, ua nui na la i hala ia kaua o ka noho pu ana, a ua kokoke e make ma keia aina malihini; nolaila, ke nonoi aku nei au ia oe, e ae mai oe ia’u e holo au e ike i na makua o kaua.” [ ]","Here ends their story for they are all dead. Continuing that of Namakaokahai and Aukelenuiaiku. After they had lived on in peace and happiness for some time, Aukelenuiaiku said to his wife: “My wife, we have lived together now for many days, and I have become old and about to die in this strange land. I would therefore request of you that you grant me leave to go and see our parents.” [ ]"
"Mahope o ko Namakaokahai ae ana ia Aukelenuiaiku e holo i Kuaihelani, hele aku la o Aukelenuiaiku e hai aku i na kaikoeke i kona hele, oia o Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua, Kahaumana.

He said: “I am going to the land of Kuaihelani to see my parents.” When the brothers of Namakaokahai heard this they all gave their consent, and Kanemoe, the oldest, expressed a desire to accompany Aukelenuiaiku to Kuaihelani."
"E pono nae e olelo kakou no Kanemoe mamua, i ole oukou e haohao e ka poe e heluhelu ana. Ua olelo ia maloko o keia moolelo, ua hana o Kanemoe ma kona maalea.

Nolaila, ua hana ia ko Kanemoe uhane maanei i kino maoli, nolaila, e hoolohe kakou i ka moolelo.","We will here speak of Kanemoe, to prevent confusion. It is said in this legend that in order to accomplish his desire he had to resort to cunning and deceived his sister. Namakaokahai was feared by her brothers; therefore, in order to be able to answer the calls, Kanemoe planned to take out his spirit from his body and give it another body, and then to leave the one containing his spirit behind as a substitute to make the replies to the sister’s calls. No sooner than he hit upon this plan he proceeded to the making of the new body for his spirit."
"Unuhi ae la o Kanemoe i kona uhane, a noho iho la me he kino kanaka ala, Kahea aku la o Kanemoe e like me ka Namakaokahai kahea ana penei: “Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua, Kahaumana.” O like mai la lakou a pau loa, o na kino maoli ekolu, o ke kino uhane hookahi, ua like no na leo o lakou aole nae i ikaika loa, nolaila, noho hou laua mamuli o ka Kanemoe olelo, e olelo ana, “a ikaika ka leo o ka uhane, alaila, holo kaua Kuaihelani.”","After the body was completed Kanemoe took out his spirit and put it into the new body, which resembled him in all details. In order not to make any mistakes in reference to the sound of the voice he thought he would make a test, so he called out, imitating his sister: “Kanemoe, Kaneapua, Leapua, Kahaumana?” They all answered, the three real bodies and the spirit. The voice sounded just like his, except that it was rather weak. Because of this weakness in the voice of his substitute, he prevailed upon Aukelenuiaiku to delay their trip for a while until the voice of his substitute grew stronger. This request was granted and the trip was postponed for a while."
"A pau keia mau mea ia laua, holo aku la laua a noho i Kuaihelani. Elua po, elua ao, hiki laua i Kuaihelani.

The trip took up two nights and two days. Upon their arrival at Kuaihelani, they looked over the land but failed to see any of the people; they heard no sound of any kind; there was nothing good growing on the land, for the land was overgrown with weeds."
"A hiki laua i ka lua, kahea iho la o Aukelenuiaiku: “E Kamooinanea e!” Aole he leo i olelo mai, nolaila, manao laua ua make.

When they came to the mouth of the hole, Aukelenuiaiku called: “Kamooinanea,” but no response was heard, so they thought that she must be dead. The reason why Kamooinanea did not hear the call was because the coral on her forehead and the coral of the floor of the sea had grown together and she was entirely covered over, so she was unable to hear the call of her grandson Aukelenuiaiku. After calling, Aukelenuiaiku stood up and stamped his feet down on the coral with all his might, breaking it into pieces, and at the same time exposing the body of his grandmother. When Aukelenuiaiku looked at her body, he saw that it was thin and reduced to almost nothing. [ ] Aukelenuiaiku then called her, saying: “Kamooinanea.”"
"“O”, ae la o Kamooinanea, “O”. Nana ae la ia, o kana moopuna o Aukelenuiaiku, aloha ae la ia: “E walina oe.”","Kamooinanea answered, “Yes.” Then she looked up and she saw that it was her grandson, Aukelenuiaiku. She then greeted him, saying: “My greetings to you.”"

“I hoi mai e ike ia oukou.” Ninau hou aku o Aukelenuiaiku: “Auhea o Iku ma?”,“I came to see you all.” Aukelenuiaiku asked of Kamooinanea: “Where is Iku and the others?”
"I mai o Kamooinanea: “Aia i Kauai kahi i noho ai. O ke kumu o ka hele, o ka naauauwa ia oukou i na keiki, no ka pau loa i ka hele.

The reason they left was because of the anguish for you boys, for you had all left them. When your father, Iku, arrived at Kauai he got into a fight with Kukoae, the king of Kauai, but he was victorious and became the king of Kauai. After a time another battle was fought because of your sister, who is very pretty, and your father was defeated by Makukoae. ”"

That upon the arrival of Olopana and his wife Luukia in Tahiti from Hawaii, Moikeha became infatuated with Luukia and soon after took her as his paramour. Olopana, the husband of Luukia, harbored no ill feeling at this action of Moikeha, but looked on without showing his disapproval, and was, in fact, of one mind with his friend."
"Mahope iho oia manawa, lilo ae la o Olopana i kuhina nui nona ma na aina apau o Tahiti.

At about this time Mua, a Tahitian Prince, also became infatuated with Luukia, but his approaches were not approved, or, rather, were not encouraged by Luukia, although he, upon several occasions, pressed his suit with great vigor. When he saw that although his suit was being rejected, that of Moikeha’s was being accepted, he thereupon made up his mind to sow discord between her and her lover, and in that way persuade Luukia to be separated from Moikeha."
"I kekahi manawa, he alii puni lealea o Moikeha, hele aku la oia maloko o na aha lealea pahee, olohu, a me kekahi mau lealea e ae.

It was often the case at these places where the games were held for people to gather and to cheer the winners. In the course of these games the cheering and commotion were often heard by Luukia."
"A i mea e ko ai ko Mua manao ino no Moikeha, nolaila hele aku la o Mua, a i mua o Luukia, olelo aku, me ka ninau aku nae: “E Luukia, ua lohe ae nei anei oe i keia leo uwa o ka aha lealea a ke alii?” (Moikeha).

E olelo hoohilahila ana o Moikeha ia oe no ko wahi huna; aole paha kela piha uwa a ke alii he pono.”","One day Mua, in order to carry out his designs to sow discord between Moikeha and Luukia, happened to be in the presence of Luukia when the cheering at the games was heard, and, believing that the opportune moment was come, asked Luukia: “Say, Luukia, do you hear the cheering at the king’s games?” Luukia answered: “Yes, I hear the cheering.” Mua then remarked to Luukia: “You must not for one moment think that that cheering at all means well for you. No, Moikeha is publicly defaming you. That cheering is not intended for your good.”"
"A no keia mea, lilo iho la keia olelo hoopunipuni a Mua i mea oiaio ia Luukia.

Luukia thereupon ordered her immediate attendants to lash herself in such a way as to bar herself against his approaches. Luukia was then corded with a fine rope from her waist to the middle of her thighs, and the ends of the rope were then fixed in such a way as to make them almost impossible to be found. This cording, spoken of as the “pau of Luukia”, is used as a covering for water-gourds, [ ] and it is also used in the lashing of the single as well as of the double canoe, and is spoken of as such even at this present generation."
"Ia Moikeha i ka lealea a hoi mai, me ka manao ua pono ka noho ana, aole ka.

Upon Moikeha’s arrival at home he met Luukia, and although there was some small change in his reception, still on the whole he was treated in the usual manner, Luukia entering into conversation with him. It was only after Moikeha had discovered that Luukia had been lashed that she ceased speaking to him. Immediately upon arriving at the palace, Moikeha saw that there was something wrong by Luukia’s countenance, and he at once began to ponder within himself as to the probable cause of the trouble."
"A ma ka po ana iho, i loko o ko laua manawa moe, he mea haohao ia Moikeha i ka moe pu ana me kona pau, aole hoi i ikeia ia mea mamua i loko o ko laua mau la oluolu. E like me kona (Moikeha) ike ana i ka hana a kela wahine ana, pela no oia i kali ai me ka nana ana i loko o na po eha, aia nae, e mau ana no ka paa mau o ka pau o Luukia; a no ia mea, ma kekahi po iho, makemake ae la o Moikeha e ike ia laua iho ma ko laua kuleana mau. I ka manawa i kupu ae ai ko Moikeha manao e ike me kana wahine, alaila, wehe ae la o Moikeha i ka pau o Luukia, a hemo, i nana aku ka hana o ke kane, ua hoahaia o Luukia i ka aha a paa loa, mai ka puhaka a na kumu uha. Nolaila, ninau aku la o Moikeha ia Luukia, i ke kumu o keia hana a ka wahine, aka, aole nae e hiki ia Luukia ke hai aku.

A heaha la hoi kana, eia hoi wau ke hele nei a huna na maka i kahi e, i ku hoi kuu makaia.”","That night, while in their preparation to retire, Moikeha was surprised at seeing Luukia retiring with her pau still on, something entirely unusual with her, she not having done anything of the kind during their peaceful days. Moikeha, however, did not show his surprise by any utterance, but bided his own time for four nights with the determination if possible to find out the cause of this extraordinary behavior on the part of Luukia. On the fourth night Moikeha saw no change, Luukia still wore the pau on retiring. The next night, Moikeha, with a desire to ascertain the cause of this queer behavior, undertook to unfasten the pau, and after it was unfastened he saw that Luukia had been corded from her waist to the middle of her thighs. Upon making this discovery, Moikeha asked Luukia why she had done this, but she made no reply. From evening until midnight Moikeha urged her to tell him the cause of this lashing, but she utterly refused to even say one word. All through the rest of the night Moikeha pondered over this recent change that came over Luukia and said to himself: “Your actions are indeed strange. Here we have been living right along in peace, and now you will not even speak to me. What fault have I committed that you should cause yourself to be lashed in this manner? Very well then, I am going to absent myself from you and shall go to some other land, and thus give you a chance to have your wish fulfilled.”"
"Ia manawa, hoolale koke ae la o Moikeha i kana keiki hookama, e hoomakaukau na waa, me ka olelo aku o Moikeha i ua keiki la: “E holo kaua i Hawaii, no ka mea, e naauaua ana wau i ke aloha o ka wahine Luukia, a nalo kaupaku o kuu hale Lanikeha nei la, alaila pau ka manao ana ia Tahiti.” Ia manawa, hoolale koke ae la o Kamahualele i na i-hoewaa, a makaukau, alaila, lawe ae la o Moikeha i na kaikuahine ona ia Makapuu laua o Makaaoa, a lawe ae la i na kaikaina ia Kumukahi laua o Haehae, a lawe pu ae la i kona kahuna ia Mookini, a me na kanaka koikoi o ko Moikeha alo, oia o na hookele a me na kahuna punahele, a me na kiu nana e nana ka aina.","Thereupon, Moikeha directed his foster-son to make ready the double canoe in the following words: “Let us sail for Hawaii, because I am so agonized for love of this woman (Luukia). When the ridge-pole of my house, Lanikeha, disappears below the horizon, then I shall cease to think of Tahiti.” Kamahualele then directed the paddlers to get the double canoe ready. As soon as this was done Moikeha took his sisters, Makapuu and Makaaoa, his two younger brothers, Kumukahi and Haehae. He also took his priest Mookini and the chief men who wait on him, such as his navigators and sailing masters, his immediate attendants and favorites, and also his spies who were to spy out the land."
"Ma ia wanaao, ma ka puka ana o ka hoku hookelewaa, kau ae la o Moikeha maluna o na waa ona, a kau pu aku la no hoi me kona mau hoa holo. Mai ia wanaao a puka ka la, ike mua lakou ia Hilo, ua pono ka holo ana, ia wa ku mai ai o Kamahualele [ ] a pule aku la ma ke ano mele e like me ka mea i oleloia ma mua ae. A hiki mai la lakou i Hilo, makemake ae la o Kumukahi laua me Haehae e noho i Hilo, a hoonoho ae la o Moikeha ia laua malaila.","One early morning at dawn, just at the rise of the star Sirius, Moikeha boarded his double canoe, taking with him all his attendants and followers, and set out from Tahiti. From that morn until sunrise when they first beheld Hilo all went well, [ ] whereupon Kamahualele stood up and prayed by way of a mele their voyage hither. Upon their arrival at Hilo, Kumukahi and Haehae became charmed with Hilo, and so expressed to Moikeha their desire to remain there, whereupon Moikeha allowed them to take up their residence at Hilo."
"Ia manawa haalele o Moikeha ma ia Hilo a holo mai la lakou ma ka aoao akau o Hawaii, a hiki ma Kohala, makemake ae la o Mookini me Kaluawilinau e noho ma Kohala, nolaila, hoonoho ae la o Moikeha ia laua malaila.

A ia lakou i hiki aku ai, aia nae o Kakakauhanui ka mea nona ka waa. O kana hana mau o ka lawaia, a he mea mau no ia ia ka holo ma ia wahi i na la a pau i ka lawaia.","Moikeha soon after set sail from Hilo, sailing along the north coast of Hawaii until they arrived at Kohala, when Mookini and Kaluawilinau expressed their desire to take up their residence at Kohala. Moikeha therefore landed them there. On leaving Kohala they sailed along the eastern coast of Maui until they reached Hana, when one of his men, Honuaula, expressed his desire of making this his place of residence, so he too was allowed to remain behind. From this last place they sailed on until they were between Lanai and Molokai. When directly opposite Kawela, Kamahualele spied a canoe directly out from the Kalaau Point, when their course was changed and the canoe was steered towards this canoe by Kamahualele. Upon their arrival at the place where the canoe was floating, they found it was Kakakauhanui. This man’s usual occupation was fishing, and it was his daily custom to come to this place for this purpose."
"Nana ae la o Moikeha, he kanaka nui a puipui o Kakakauhanui, a he kanaka ikaika a ano koa no hoi. Nolaila lawe ae la o Moikeha ia ia i aikane nana, me ke kauoha iho nae: “E noho oe i anei, e holo ae wau a loaa ia’u kahi kupono o makou e noho ai; aia a hiki mai kekahi hoouna i ou nei alaila hele ae oe.” A pau ka lakou olelo ana malaila, haalele lakou ia Kalaau, a holo aku la a hiki i Oahu, a no ka makemake o na kaikuahine e noho ma Oahu, nolaila nonoi aku la o Makapuu laua o Makaaoa ia Moikeha e noho i Oahu, me ka i aku: “Ua makemake ae nei maua e noho maanei, i ike aku ai i ke ao o ka aina, Tahiti.” A no ia mea, mamuli o ka makemake o kona mau kaikuahine, hoonoho iho la ia Makapuu laua o Makaaoa ma Oahu.

Upon arriving at Oahu, Moikeha’s sisters expressed their wish to remain in Oahu and make their homes here, so Makapuu and Makaaoa requested Moikeha to allow them to remain, saying: “We wish to make this our place of residence, where we can see the cloud drifts of Tahiti.” Because of this desire on the part of the two sisters, Makapuu and Makaaoa, they were allowed to remain on Oahu, thus leaving Moikeha, his foster-son Kamahualele, the two paddlers Kapahi and Moanaikaiaiwe, Kipunuiaiakamau and his companion, and the two spies Kaukaukamunolea and his companion, to continue on the journey."
"Haalele iho la lakou ia Oahu, holo aku la a hiki ma Wailua; ia manawa, ua ahiahi poeleele ko lakou hiki ana aku, nolaila, aole lakou i pae iuka, hekau iho la na waa i ke kai a po a ao; ma ke kakahiaka nui nana aku la na kanaka i keia kaulua e lana ana iloko o ke kai, me ka puloulou alii i luna.

This was late in the evening, being dark when they arrived, so they did not land, but moored their double canoe all that night until the next day. Early in the morning the people saw this double canoe floating in the sea with the kapu sticks of a chief aboard. About this time the canoes made for the landing and were lifted up and deposited on the shore. When the travelers landed, the people were gathering in great numbers to go surf-riding at the surf of Kamakaiwa. In this gathering of people were the two daughters of the king of Kauai, who were on their way to ride the surf; they were Hooipoikamalanai and Hinauu. Upon seeing the people on their way to ride the surf, Moikeha and his companions also followed along to take part in this morning exercise. Moikeha was a goodly man to look upon, he had dark reddish hair and a tall commanding figure."
"Hele aku la o Moikeha ma i kahi e heenalu ia ana; he alii maikai o Moikeha, he ehu kumuuli, he kanaka loihi no hoi. A o Hooipoikamalanai ma hoi, makemake [ ] ae la laua ia Moikeha, a manao ae la laua e lawe ia Moikeha i kane na laua.

Moikeha in the meantime was also struck with the beauty and grace of the two sisters, and he, too, fell in love with them and decided to take one of the girls to be his wife. After enjoying the surf for a time, Hooipoikamalanai and her sister returned home and informed their father of what they had seen, and said: “We wish to take that young chief as a husband for one of us.”"
"A mamuli o ka makemake o na kaikamahine alii o Kauai hooholo ae la ko laua makuakane, e kiiia o Moikeha a e laweia mai ma ka hale o na kaikamahine alii; alaila kiiia aku la o Moikeha, a me kona mau hoa, a laweia mai la.

Moikeha and his company were thereupon sent for and were brought in the presence of the king. The love on the part of the young people being mutual, Hooipoikamalanai and Hinauu took Moikeha to be their husband. So Moikeha thus became king of Kauai after the death of his father-in-law."
"Mahope iho o ko Moikeha hoao ana ia Hooipoikamalanai laua o Hinauu, lilo ae la o Moikeha i alii nui mamuli o ka make ana o kona makuahunowai kane. Noho iho la o Moikeha me kana mau wahine, a loaa mai loko ae o lakou elima mau keiki, he mau keiki kane wale no. A penei no ka mookuauhau o ia hanauna:","After Moikeha had taken Hooipoikamalanai and Hinauu to be his wives, he became the king of Kauai, after the death of his father-in-law. Moikeha had five children with his two wives, all boys. Following is the genealogy of that generation:"
"O Moikeha ka makuakane, o Hooipoikamalanai ka makuahine, o Kapaa i Kauai ka aina, oia kahi o Kila i hanau ai. Ekolu lakou o ka hanau ana, o Kila ka muli. I ko lakou wa kamalii, he hooholoholo waa ka hana i ka muliwai o Wailua, a i ka wa nae e hakoko ai me na kaikuaana, na Kila no ka eha o na kaikuaana.

There were three children in the family, of which Kila was the youngest. While very young it was their custom to resort to the Wailua River and there learn the art of canoe sailing. In the wrestling matches Kila, though the youngest, always prevailed over his older brothers. One day, in order to determine which one of his sons was the strongest, bravest and most skillful in the art of canoe sailing, Moikeha decided to give them a test. After calling his sons to come before him, he said: “I want you all to go to the other side of the river and set your canoes down in the water and let them sail toward me. The one who will be able to so steer his canoe as to hit me in the navel will surely be the most prosperous amongst you.” After arriving at their stations the first-born set his canoe down and steered it to his father, but it missed the mark. The second son then in his turn set his down and steered it for the mark, but it missed also. Kila then in his turn started his, and it sailed directly to Moikeha and hit his navel. Moikeha then addressed his sons, saying: “You two,” turning to the oldest, “will never amount to much. This your youngest brother will be the most prosperous of you all.”"
"A nui ae la o Kila, nui pu kona maikai a me ka nani, a oia ko Kauai oi a puni; aole ona lua, nui pu me ka ikaika a me ke koa. O Moikeha, mai Kahiki ka hele ana mai, i aaia i ke aloha o Luukia, a haalele aku ia i kona hale ia Moaulanuiakea, a me na ’lii, na kanaka, na kupu o ka moana.","As Kila grew up into manhood he also grew in beauty and manliness, so much so that he was recognized as the most handsome man in all of Kauai, he having no equal. He also grew up to be a very strong and brave man."
"Ma kona hele ana mai, loaa o Kakakauhanui i ka lae o Kalauu i Molokai, e lawaia ana. He kanaka uha loihi ia, e luu ana ke kino ilalo, e kaohi ana ka uha i ka waa, he kanaka aho loa. Lawe mai la o Moikeha ia ia i keiki hookama, a noho i Kauai. He ’lii nui o Moikeha, a he ’lii no hoi ka wahine o Hooipoikamalanai, no Kauai a puni.","Moikeha originally came from Tahiti, through grief and depression of spirit over Luukia. Because of his great grief he left his home Moaulanuiakea, the chiefs, the people and the demi-gods of the deep. On his way to Kauai he met Kakakauhanui off the Kalaau point, Molokai, fishing. This man had very long legs; his body while in the water could steady his canoe with his legs. He could stay under water without breathing for a very long time. Upon meeting this man, Moikeha took him as an adopted son and brought him along to Kauai. Moikeha was a high chief, and his wife Hooipoikamalanai was a chiefess of very high rank throughout the whole island of Kauai."
"Hoomakaukau o Moikeha i na waa no kana keiki no Kila, e holo ai i Kahiki i kona wahi i kumakaia ia ai e kona poe enemi. A makaukau, ee na hoewaa, na ka liu, na kahu, na makuakane hanauna; o Kakakauhanui, o Kila i luna o ka pola o na waa.

After everything pertaining to the voyage was ready, the paddlers, the bailers, immediate attendants, uncles and Kakakauhanui boarded the canoe together with Kila, who sat in the covered platform, and they set sail for Tahiti. Before Kila boarded the canoe, however, Moikeha addressed him saying: “You are on your way. Don’t fail to recognize your uncle Makalii, or you will kill him.” After all the islands had disappeared and all that could be seen was the top of Maunakea, they were met by Keaumiki and Keauka, two [ ] monster demigods of the deep, who drew their canoe down to the coral beds of the sea: so Kakakauhanui dove down to the bottom and stayed there for ten and two nights before coming up again. Keaumiki and Keauka were only able to stay down ten nights. This feat of endurance saved the canoe. The voyage was then resumed. When they were approaching near to Tahiti they first touched at a small island where the aunt of Moikeha was living, a supernatural rat, Kanepohihi by name. Her eyes were covered over with wrinkles and she was blind. When Kila came upon her she was cooking bananas in the ashes. When he saw Kanepohihi cooking bananas, he reached down, took the bananas and placed them on to one side of the cooking place. When Kanepohihi reached for the bananas she was unable to find them, so she said to herself: “There must be a demi-god about.” At this Kila addressed her saying: “My greetings to you, Kanepohihi.”"
Olelo aku o Kila: “I aloha mai ko moopuna haku ia oe.”,Kila continued: “Your grandchild and lord send you aloha greetings.”
Ninau aku o Kanepohihi: “Owai ua moopuna haku nei a’u?”,Kanepohihi asked: “Who is this grandchild and lord of mine?”
"Ninau hou mai o Kanepohihi: “Ke ola ala no ka o Moikeha?” “Ae, ke ola ala no.”",Kanepohihi again asked: “Is Moikeha then still alive?” Kila replied: “He is still alive.”
"“I walea ia Kauai, I ka la hiki ae a po iho, I ke kee a ka nalu o Makaiwa, I ka hiki mai a ka la maluna, O ke kalukalu o Kewa, O ka wai halau o Wailua. O ka lealea o ka mai o kuu makuahine, O Hooipoikamalanai, O kahi noho no o Kauai a make.”","“He is indulging in ease in Kauai, Where the sun rises and sets again, Where the surf of Makaiwa curves and bends, Where the sun comes up over The kalukalu of Kewa; The cool and calm shade of Kewa, The stretched out waters of Wailua, And the entrancing favors of my mother Hooipoikamalanai. He will live and die in Kauai.”"
"Olelo mai o Kanepohihi: “Akahi ka hoi ka loaa o ko makou inoa ia oe, aole hoi he loaa o kou inoa.” Olelo aku o Kila me ka hai i kona inoa ponoi: “O Kila iuka, o Kila i kai, o Kila pa wahine, a Hooipoikamalanai o Kama au a Moikeha.”","Kanepohihi replied: “You seem to know my name, but I don’t know who you are.” He then told her his own name: “I am Kila of the uplands, Kila of the lowlands. I am Kila, the last child of my mother Hooipoikamalanai, and the offspring of Moikeha.”"
"Olelo mai o Kanepohihi: “E kuu haku, heaha ka huakai a kuu haku o ka hiki ana mai?” I mai o Kila: “He huakai imi alii.”",Kanepohihi replied: “You are my lord. What is the object of this voyage and visit paid me by my lord?” Kila replied: “It is a voyage in search of a chief.”
"“Aohe alii; a Kahuahuakai pau na ’lii i ka luku ia, koe ko makuakane, koe au a me ka muli o ko makuakane, nolaila, hele aku ai ko makuakane o Moikeha a noho ia Kauai.” Ma ko Kila mana a me ka ike, olelo aku la ia: “He ’lii no, aia la i uka o Wahiawa, ua alai ia mai e ka ohu, ua paa ia Huihui laua o Maeele.” O ke kumu o [ ] Kila i hiki ai imua O Kanepohihi, o ka pololi. I mai o Kanepohihi: “Aohe a’u ai, o ka noho wale iho la no i anei. Hookahi no mea ai o ko makuakane o Makalii.”","Kanepohihi answered: “There are no chiefs left. Kahuahuakai was the last of the chiefs that was slain, with the exception of your father, myself and your father’s younger brother. This was the cause why your father Moikeha left this place and moved to Kauai.” [ ] Through Kila’s power of foresight he answered: “There is a chief. He is living in the uplands of Wahiawa, screened by the fog and secreted by Huihui and Maeele.” The reason why this call was made by Kila on Kanepohihi, was because he was without food. To the request for food, Kanepohihi replied: “I have no food. All I do is to live in idleness here. There is only one person who has food, your uncle Makalii.”"
"A Makalii, o ko Moikeha kaikaina no ia, a oia no ke ’lii o ka aina, a nana ua koko nei o Makalii (no ka inoa), ilaila ka ai, ka ai, na mea a pau loa. A he ike no ko Makalii i ke kilokilo e like me Moikeha, a me Kila; no kona ike e hiki aku ana nei kupu (Kila) i ka aina, nolaila, lawe keia i na mea ai a pau a paa i ke koko, kau i luna, oia kela olelo kahiko o Hawaii nei: “Hului koko a Makalii kau iluna.” E pii ae ana o Kanepohihi ma kona kino iole, a aki i ke koko a Makalii, haule ka ai a me ka ia i lalo nei, loaa ka ai a Kila a me na ohua.","Makalii was Moikeha’s own younger brother, and he was the king and ruler of the land. He had a net named after himself, Makalii, in which were kept the food and fish as well as other things. Makalii, who was also educated in all of the arts of the day, could tell of coming future events, as well as Moikeha or Kila. Because of this power as a fortune-teller he was able to foresee the arrival of Kila to his kingdom. So he took up all the food and placed it in a net and hung it out of reach, which was the origin of the old Hawaiian saying: “Makalii drew in his net (koko) and hung it up.” Kanepohihi, on being requested for food, changed herself into the form of a rat and climbed up, nibbled at the net of Makalii, cutting it and causing the food and fish to fall out, thus supplying Kila and his companions with food."
"Holo aku la o Kila a hiki i ka aina, holo aku la ka waa o Kila a ke awa kapu e ku ana ka pahu kapu, no Moikeha ia wahi; aohe waa pae malaila, aohe kanaka hele, hele no make, he kapu mai ko Moikeha noho ana a hele, oia mau no ke kapu a me ke kiai ia.

This place was Moikeha’s; no canoe was allowed to land here; no person was allowed to pass by it upon pain of death. The place had been kapued before Moikeha left, and ever since his departure its sacredness had been maintained. When the canoe was nearing the landing place the people on shore were heard calling: “There is a canoe! There is a canoe!! That canoe does not seem to have any fear for the kapu of the king. Your superior strength, if any you have, will be the only salvation for you this day.” Before Kila and his people reached the landing place and hauled their canoe up on the sand, he was bundled up and placed on the platform. Kila, as we have said, was a very handsome man and was good to look upon, so much so that it could not be hidden by the covering in which he was wrapped. After he had been placed on the platform he addressed his followers, saying: “When you see a large man come to the canoe, it is Mua. He is a great admirer of women. He is the man that was the betrayer of Moikeha, and the one that caused Moikeha to leave his own country. Don’t tell him about me, in case he should ask you.” As soon as Mua reached the canoe, he looked over the men and stood them up. Examining the first one and finding a protuberance on his body, he remarked: “You will never be able to get Luukia.” He then examined the next man, and so on to the last, with the exception of Kila. The reason why Mua examined the men was because he wished to find one who could command the admiration of Luukia, and by him get a chance to approach Luukia, as he had never been able to please Luukia even up to this time."
"He wahine maikai loa o Luukia, aohe ona lua ma ia aina a puni, o ka Olopana wahine ia, aole nae o laua moe kino, no ka pehu o Olopana, nolaila, ua paa o Luukia i ke kamaaha ia e Olopana (oia kela aha waa, e hoa ia nei a hiki i keia la), mai ka hele ana mai o Moikeha a hiki ia Kila. [ ]","Luukia was a very beautiful woman and had no equal. She was the wife of Olopana, and owing to his being afflicted with the dropsy they never lived together. [ ] Luukia, however, had been bound, or netted, by Olopana with small cord in the fashion of the lashing of canoes ever since the departure of Moikeha."
"Nolaila, ninau aku la o Mua: “A heaha hoi keia opeope nui e kau nei i ka pola?” Olelo mai na kanaka: “He opeope kapa.” Hele aku la keia haha, a ike iho la he kanaka. Haha iho la o Mua, wehe ae la i ke kapa, nana iho la ma ke kua, a me ke alo, aohe puu, aohe kee, olelo iho la: “Loaa ia oe o Luukia. Ea, a i loaa o Luukia ia oe, na’u e moe mamua.”","Upon seeing the bundle on the platform, Mua asked the people: “What is this large bundle on the platform?” The people replied: “It is a bundle of clothes.” Mua then went up to it and felt the bundle. After feeling it he opened the bundle and discovered a man. He then looked all over the man and found him to be perfect in every respect. He then remarked: “You will be admired by Luukia. If in case you should, will you ask her to be mine?”"
"Mamua ae o ka nana ana o Mua ia Kila, ua olelo aku o Kila i na kanaka: “I hiki mai auanei o Mua a i nonoi mai e moe me Luukia, olelo aku oukou, e moe i loko o ka waa nei, ilalo ke alo, aohe make ala, aohe make oni, aohe make olelo, e moe malie, i loaa o Luukia.” A pau ka nana ana ia Kila, olelo aku la na kanaka ia Mua e like me na olelo a Kila, a lohe o Mua, he mea olioli ia. A moe o Mua i lalo ke alo, i loko o ka waa, olelo aku o Kila i na kanaka: “E mimi maluna iho o Mua.” Pela ka hana ana, a po ka la, a ao ka po, a po hou ka la, ua lana ka mimi maluna o Mua, a make iho la ia me ke ko ole o kona kuko ia Luukia. Pela i hookoia ai ka huhu o Moikeha i kona mea nana i kumakaia, ma ka noonoo o kana keiki o Kila.","Before Mua boarded the canoe, Kila had instructed his men as follows: “If Mua should come and ask that some one of you ask Luukia to be his wife, tell him to lie in the canoe face down, and not to get up or move about or speak, but he must lie very quietly so that he will be able to get Luukia.” After inspecting Kila, the people told Mua to do as they had been instructed by Kila. When Mua heard this he was very glad. As soon as Mua had lain face down in the canoe, Kila told the men to hold Mua down and urinate on him. This was done until it covered him for two days and one night, so that he died without accomplishing his desire respecting Luukia. Thus, through the wit of Kila, was the betrayer of Moikeha his father avenged."
"Iloko o ko Moikeha wa e noho alii nui ana ma ke aupuni, elua ona koa ikaika loa, o Niniukalani, o Pohinakahonua, aohe koa e oi mamua o laua. Hele mai la o Niniukalani me kana laau palau, o Kahikinaakala a ke one maloo, oniu. Olelo aku o Kila i na kanaka: “Owai ko oukou e hele e koa me Niniukalani?” Aohe kanaka aa, no ka makau; ku ae o Ukulii a olelo: “Owau ke hele e koa.” Ae mai o Kila: “Ae, o oe, o ko uuku auanei komo oe i loko, o koiala nui hele i waho, i lele oe i uka, mai nana oe iluna, o make oe, i lalo oe e nana ai i ke aka, i ka malu maluna ou. Ina e hookaa kela i ka laau ma ka hema, ma ka akau oe e ku ai, aia ka hauna laau ma ka hema, a ina hoi ma ka akau ma ka hema oe.”","During the reign of Moikeha he had two very powerful warriors, Niniukalani and Pohinakahonua. There were none stronger than these two. Upon seeing the canoe coming to be moored on the kapued grounds, Niniukalani took up his war club, Kahikinaakala, and approached the canoe. When he reached the dry sand he began twirling his war club. As the man was approaching, Kila asked his men: “Which one of you is willing to go and fight Niniukalani?” No one spoke up for some time, as they were all afraid. Ukulii, however, arose and said: “I will go and fight him.” Kila then said: “Yes, you are so small that you will be able to get very close to him. When you get ashore don’t look up or you will get killed; but keep your eyes always down and watch the shadow over you. If he twirls his club on the left, jump to the right, as he will then strike to the left; and if he twirls on the right, jump to the left. ” After Kila had imparted his instructions, Ukulii jumped ashore with his war club and approached Niniukalani. Niniukalani was twice the size of Ukulii and was sure of beating him, which he likened to so much chaff."
"A pau ka olelo ana a Kila, lele aku la o Ukulii me kana laau, lele aku la a ku me Niniukalani, ua palua kona nui imua o Ukulii, a he mea ole o Ukulii i kona manao ana, heaha la ia imua ona?

O Niniukalani, ke hookaa nei i ka laau palau ana, ia Kahikinaakala hoomoe iluna o Ukulii, komo ae ana o Ukulii i ka akau, hala ka laau, loaa ke one, puehu liilii, moe ke awawa, nalo laua nei i loko o ke one. Manao na mea a pau ua make o Ukulii; a mahope, ku hou laua nei, hookaa o Ukulii i ka laau ma ka hema a [ ] hoana, aole nae i uhau, alo e o Niniukalani, e waiho ae ana keia ma ka akau, loaa no o Niniukalani, make loa, kaawale o luna me lalo.","At this time the place was packed with the chiefs and people who were eager to see the conflict. They never had any idea that the small man had any chance with the big man at all. Niniukalani, upon seeing Ukulii, began to twirl his war club, Kahikinaakala, and, when Ukulii was within striking distance, let it come down; but Ukulii jumped to the right and toward his opponent. The club missed its object and hit the sand, causing it to fly in all directions, and left a deep valley, hiding the two contestants from view for a time. Everybody believed that Ukulii was killed. After [ ] the cloud of sand had settled, the people saw that both of the contestants were still there. Ukulii then twirled his club and made a feint as though to strike. Niniukalani dodged, but before he could recover himself, Ukulii struck to the right which caught Niniukalani squarely, cutting him in two and killing him instantly. At this the crowd cried out: “One for the stranger and none for the son of the soil. Nobly done! No wonder this canoe dared to land on kapued ground, for it carries a noble warrior.”"
"Uwa ka pihe o uka: “Akahi a ka malihini, aole a ke kamaaina. Koa! malama no i komo ia ai ke awa kapu o ke ’lii e keia waa eia ka he koa.” Ku mai o Pohinakahonua, me kana laau palau o Puaihanuole, paha, kaena: “He uhau ole ia i ka laau; e uhau ia okaoka, aole ia e pakele ia’u.”","Pohinakahonua, upon seeing the death of his mate, came up with his war club, Puaihanuole. He then issued a challenge, boasted and said: “He could not have been struck at; if he had he would have been in pieces. He shall not escape me.”"
"O Ukulii, hoi aku la no ia a na waa noho. Ninau o Kila: “Owai ke hele e hakaka me Pohinakahonua?” I mai o Hohoiea: “Owau.” Ao ao mai la o Kila a maopopo, hele aku la a ku me Pohinakahonua.

When Pohinakahonua was seen to come out and issue his challenge, Kila asked: “Which one of you will go and meet Pohinakahonua?” Hohoiea answered: “I will.” Kila then instructed him what to do, and he jumped ashore to meet Pohinakahonua. As soon as he was within reach Pohinakahonua swung his club to the right, but Hohoiea was not there, as he had jumped to the left of Pohinakahonua. Hohoiea then swung his club from the ground upward, which cut Pohinakahonua in two from his hips to his head, killing him. At this the crowd gave another shout, saying: “The strangers have two, and the sons of the soil have none. This canoe carries some mighty men who have killed the warrior guards of the land.” The result of the conflict was then carried to the king, Makalii. When Makalii heard it he arose and came down with his war club, Naulukohelewalewa. Makalii at this time was living in a land above the clouds. Makalii was a goodly man to look upon, closely resembling his older brother Moikeha. He was very powerful and brave, but not like Kila. As Makalii arrived on the kapued ground he began to swing his war club right and left. Upon seeing this Kila said to his men: “That is Makalii, the king. He is a very powerful man; none of you will be able to stand up against him. I will go and meet him. But before I go, I want you to remember this: if I shall be slain in this encounter, you have your course of escape, return by it to Kauai; but in case I live, then all will be well.” Kila then took up his war club, Kahihikolo, and jumped ashore from the canoe, stepping on the rocks. At sight of Kila the crowd began to shout, admiring his beauty. Even the ants were heard to sing in his praise; the birds sang, the pebbles rumbled, the shells cried out, the grass withered, the smoke hung low, the rainbow appeared, the thunder was heard, the dead came to life, the hairless dogs were seen and countless spirits of all kinds were seen. All these things mentioned were the people of Moikeha, who upon the arrival of Kila his son, caused themselves to be seen, in testimony of Kila’s high chief rank."
"A kokoke o Kila i o Makalii la, hoomoe iho ana o Makalii i kana laau palau, ia Naulukohelewalewa hio ka makani, lele ka lepo me ke one, kahawai kahi i loaa ai i ka [ ] laau, nalo laua i loko o ka lepo.

Nolaila, komo o Kila i ka akau, a pakele i ka make weliweli a Makalii. Ku hou laua, hookaa na laau hoomoe o Kila i kana laau palau, ia Kahikikolo i lalo o ka lepo, mana kahawai, kahe ka wai, wili ka puahiohio, wili ka lepo me ke one i ka lewa.

The wind whistled by, the dust and sand arose in clouds, and a deep valley [ ] was seen where the club struck the ground. The two were hidden in the dust. The people ashore thought that Kila was killed, but after the cloud of dust and sand had settled they beheld Makalii and Kila still facing each other; because when Makalii swung his club on the right he brought it down on his left, so Kila had jumped toward the right side of Makalii and was saved from a terrible death. As they again faced each other, Kila twirled and brought down his club, Kahikikolo, the swirl of which felled Makalii. The reason of this escape was because Kila had in mind the warning given him by Moikeha his father, upon his departure from Kauai, in the following words: “You are about to go on your voyage. If you should fight with your uncle, don’t be thoughtless, else you will kill him.” This was the only reason why Makalii was saved; otherwise he would not have again seen the warming sun."
"Hoi aku la no o Kila a luna o na waa noho, o Makalii hoi, waiho iho la, a moa ka umu, ala ae la me ke kunewanewa a hoi i ka hale. Ma keia hoi ana, he mihi nui ko Makalii i kona pakele mai make, o kona ike ana no ia i ka aina, hoi i luna a make.","After the fight Kila returned to his canoe, while Makalii laid on the ground for a period of time sufficiently long to cook an oven (umu) of food; whereupon he arose and staggered to the house. While on his way to the house he congratulated himself on his miraculous escape. This was the last time he was seen on earth, for he returned up above and died there."
"Puni ae la ka aina ia Kila, pae aku la na waa, hele aku la o Kila, uwe ka pipipi, a ninau mai: “Heaha ka huakai a kuu haku o ka hiki ana mai?” I aku o Kila: “He huakai imi alii.” Hoole mai ka pipipi: “Aohe alii, ua make, o makou wale no koe, haalele ia iho makou e ko makuakane, i keia wahi, aohe ai, aohe ia, ua lawe aku ko makuakane a pau loa, o ke opu wale iho no ka makou.” Pela no o Kila i hele ai, me ka uwe mai o na makaainana ia ia nei, a hiki keia i ka hale o Moikeha ia Moaulanuiakea. He hale maikai loa, a he hale kiekie loa no hoi, he hulu manu o luna i ako ia ai, he iwi manu ka aho, he kauwila ka laau. (Ua oleloia i loko o ko Moikeha kaao, oia kona kumu i noho ai ia Kauai me Hooipoikamalanai, alaila, nalowale ke kaupoku o kona hale o Moaulanuiakea.)","The end of this contest saw Kila master of all the lands. The canoe was then beached and he went ashore. At this the shells cried and asked: “What is the object of this voyage that has brought my lord here?” Kila replied: “It is a voyage in search of a chief.” The shells said: “There are no more chiefs; all are dead. We were deserted by your father in this place, without food and without fish, your father taking everything with him, and we have managed to just exist.” Kila then continued on his way, meeting the former inhabitants of the land who wailed and cried to him, until he arrived at the palace of Moikeha, Moaulanuiakea. This was a very beautiful house, being very lofty and was thatched over with the feathers of birds. The battens were made from the bones of birds and the timbers were of kauila wood. It is said in the legend of Moikeha that the reason why Moikeha journeyed to Kauai and lived with Hooipoikamalanai was on account of his oath, never to return after the ridge-pole of his house, Moaulanuiakea, had sunk out of sight."
"A hiki o Kila, nana aku la ia i ka hale, nani, hanohano, kiekie, aole nae he kanaka, ua paa na puka, ua make na kiai, ua kupu ka nahelehele. Aia ia Kila, he ki no ka hale, no na kiai, no na mea a pau.

Hoa ia ae la ka ipukui o Moikeha e Kila, hoi aku la o Kila a luna o ka hikiee o Moikeha moe, po iho la moe o Kila. [ ]","When Kila arrived at the house he looked it over and saw that it was indeed grand, majestic and lofty; but there were no people; the doors were fastened; the guards were dead and the place was overgrown with weeds. Kila, however, had with him the means of unfastening the doors and of bringing the guards to life as well as everything else. As he opened the gate, two of the guards came to life and wept over him. As he entered the roadway to the house, two more of the guards came to life. Arriving at the main door, two more guards came to life. As the door was opened another two came to life, and entering the house he found a guard in each room who all came and kneeled before him with tears in their eyes. Kila then lit the lamp which once belonged to Moikeha, walked to the couch and laid down. [ ]"

She choked, and her heart quickened when she thought it was Moikeha. The night was far spent when the guards fell asleep. Luukia walked softly and carefully to where Kila was sleeping and looked at him; he resembled Moikeha, but was handsomer. She leaped on him crying, and embraced and kissed him. Kila awoke startled and looked at her. Then they contended together until the break of day, when Luukia said: “I have no private; it was corded up by Olopana, and it has been sealed up from the time your father went away to this day.” Kila then said: “If you will consent it can be unfastened, and it can be closed again.” Luukia consented, and Kila unfastened [the cords]. Then they gathered up the fine strands of thought, indulging in love’s desire, and braided the lehua wreaths in dreamland, after which Luukia went her way. Later she became wholly Kila’s."
Ka Moolelo no Umi: Kekahi Alii Kaulana o ko Hawaii Nei Paeaina.,The Story of Umi: One of the Most Noted of Hawaiian Kings.
"Ua olelo ia ma keia moolelo, he keiki kapa alii o Umi, ma ka aoao o kona makuahine, o Akahiakuleana, a ma ka aoao o Liloa kona makuakane, he ’lii nui mai ke kumu mai, a ma ia aoao, he ’lii nui o Umi. [ Aka, ma ka hoomaloo ana i ka pololei o ka aoao o ka makuahine, loaa no he ’lii nui o Akahiakuleana, mai loko mai no o ka mookuauhau alii o Hawaii.]","It is said in this story that Umi was a part chief because his mother, Akahiakuleana, was not a high chiefess, although his father Liloa was a very high chief, whose genealogy could be traced to the very beginning of all things. So it is said that Umi was high on his father’s side, but very humble on his mother’s side. [ But in tracing out as to the origin of Akahiakuleana his mother, it is found that she must have been of very high blood, for her name appears in the genealogical tree of the kings of Hawaii.]"
"O Umi ka mea nona keia moolelo, aka, i mea e maopopo ai ka oiaio, nolaila, e hoomaka ka olelo mua no kona kaikuaana no Hakau.

He ’lii nui aimoku o Liloa no Hawaii a puni.","This story pertains to Umi, but in order to get at all the facts the story of Hakau his older brother should also be considered. Liloa was the father and Piena was the mother of Hakau; the father as well as the mother were chief and chiefess of very high blood. It is said that Hakau was one of the highest chiefs of Hawaii because both of his parents were of equally high blood. Waipio in Hawaii was the place where Liloa had his permanent residence. Here he lived with his wife Piena, and it was at this place that Hakau was born. Liloa was the king of the whole of Hawaii."
"A hanau o Hakau, ke keiki mua a Liloa me kana wahine hoao me Piena, hele aku la o Liloa mai Waipio aku a hiki i Koholalele, ma ka hikina o Hamakua, e pili ana me Hilo.

[ ]","Some time after the birth of Hakau, the first son of Liloa by his wife Piena, Liloa started out from Waipio and journeyed to Koholalele, a place at the east end of Hamakua, close on to Hilo. The cause of this journey by Liloa was to dedicate a temple which was at this place. The name of the temple was Manini. After the ceremonies pertaining to the dedication of the temple were ended he journeyed over to Kaawikiwiki, where he stayed for some days. The cause of the delay at this place was the games that were being held, for it was the place where people from all the neighboring districts gathered to partake in the game of pahee especially, although other games were also held there. While at the place, he one day went out to bathe in the Hoea stream, which is located next to Kealakaha. When he arrived at the place he saw a very beautiful woman, Akahiakuleana, coming out of the stream, without clothing. Her maid servant was sitting on the bank of the stream with her mistress’s garment. When Liloa saw Akahiakuleana his desire to possess her became so great that they laid together, resulting in the birth of Umi, the subject of this story, for Akahiakuleana was just over her days of defilement, hence her quick conception.

Kahalaopuna was a young and beautiful girl, a virgin; she was good to look upon and was a favorite with her people. Some time before, her parents had promised her to Kauhi, a man of note who was at this time living with Kakuhihewa, the king of Oahu. Kauhi belonged to Koolau and he lived at a place called Alele."
"I ka lohe ana o Kauhi he wahine o Kahalaopuna nana, malama mai la ia i na mea a pau loa no Kahalaopuna, a hala he mau anahulu, alaila, loaa ka hewa.

After the lapse of certain ten-day periods ( anahulu ) he, however, found something against her, and it came about in this way. Some people who were desirous of seeing Kahalaopuna put to death, while on their way from Manoa to Koolau, upon meeting Kauhi made up a slanderous story against her in the following manner: “How strange indeed was the behavior of your intended wife, Kahalaopuna! She went dancing two nights now, and on each night had a separate lover.” When Kauhi heard this from these men, he said to himself: “I shall indeed kill her for she has taken all the good things from my lord which I gave her. She has now gone and defiled herself.”"
"Pii mai la o Kauhi a loaa o Kahalaopuna ma Manoa, olelo aku ia ia e hele i Pohakea, ma uka o Ewa, e pili la me ke kuahiwi o Kaala. I ko laua hele ana, noonoo iho la o Kahalaopuna i ke kumu o keia hele ana. Ma keia hele ana o laua, ma ka uka pili kanaka ole, ma uka o Pauoa a me Waolani, malaila, a ma uka o Kalihi, pela ko laua hele ana a Manana moe laua. Eia nae, ua paa na lima o Kahalaopuna i ka nakii ia e Kauhi i ke kaula, nolaila, helelei no ka pa-u o Kahalaopuna ma kahi a laua i hele ai, no ka lima ole e hana iho ai. [ ]","Kauhi then came up to Manoa and found Kahalaopuna, and asked her to go with him to Pohakea, a place above Ewa lying close to the Kaala mountain. While on their way, she meditated within herself as to the probable cause of this journey. In going they took the upper road where people seldom passed, passing along Pauoa and Waolani, then along upper Kalihi and so on to Manana, where they spent the night. In all this traveling the hands of Kahalaopuna were bound with a cord by Kauhi and consequently her skirt (pa-u) became unfastened and trailed on behind, she being unable to fasten it properly as her hands were bound."
"A ao ae, hele aku la laua a hiki i Pohakea, pii aku la laua a hiki malalo o kekahi kumu lehua, kahea mai o Kauhi ia Kahalaopuna: “Ea! E Kahalaopuna, hele mai maanei.” E manao ana o Kahalaopuna i keia kahea a Kauhi he pono la, aole ka! A hiki o Kahalaopuna, olelo o Kauhi: “Moe aku.” Moe o Kahalaopuna, olelo iho o Kauhi: “Make oe ia’u, no ka mea, ua pau ka waiwai a ko’u haku ia oe, eia ka! na hai oe e wahi a naha, aole hoi oe i naha ia’u.” Olelo mai o Kahalaopuna: “E ke kane, e moe mai oe i ka mai a i naha, pono hoi ka make ana, aka hoi i naha ole, mai pepehi oe ia’u.” Hahaki iho la o Kauhi i ka lala lehua o ka ohia, a uhau aku la ia Kahalaopuna, elua, ekolu hahau ana, pane mai o Kahalaopuna ma ke oli penei:","On the next day they resumed their way until they came to Pohakea, then on [ ] up to a large lehua tree, where Kauhi called Kahalaopuna to come near to him. Thinking that the call boded no evil she went up to him, but no. As she stood in front of Kauhi, he said: “Lie down.” Kahalaopuna obeyed. Kauhi again said: “I am going to kill you for you have taken the property of my lord, which I gave you, and have allowed yourself to be defiled.” Kahalaopuna answered: “My husband, for you are indeed my husband, I am not defiled; you must not kill me.” Kauhi then broke off a lehua branch and struck Kahalaopuna with it; two and three times he struck her, when Kahalaopuna chanted the following lines:"
"Kuu kane mai ka uka o Kahoiwai, Mai ka uka laau hihi i ka nahele, Kuu kane o Kahaiamano e! Auwe! Me he mano la no ka lili ia’u, Ka hoi koke mai no nanahu ia’u O kuu nui aloha, ua hai iho nei e! Auwe!","My husband from the uplands of Kahoiwai, From the uplands where the creeping trees grow, My husband from Kahaimano, alas! Like unto a shark is your jealousy of me, Quickly returning to bite at me, My great love for you is, however, broken, alas!"
"I aku o Kauhi: “Aole oe e ola ia’u, no ka mea, ua naha kou mai ia hai .” I aku o Kahalaopuna: “E moe mai oe e ke kane a i naha ka mai, pono hoi kau pepehi ana.” Lele hou o Kauhi pepehi, a kokoke e make loa o Kahalaopuna, ia wa kau hou mai o Kahalaopuna i ke oli:","Kauhi again said to her: “You shall not live, for you have allowed yourself to be defiled by another.” Kahalaopuna answered: “I am not defiled, and I cannot see any reason why you should beat me thus.” Again Kauhi beat her until she was almost dead, when Kahalaopuna again chanted:"
"Kuu kane mai ka ea a Kawiliwili, Mai ke kula la i Mahinauli. Ka uli o ka ili manao i ke hoa. Auwe! E manao aku ana au o ka naulu, O ka makani i ke alo o Pokiikaua, Kuu kane liula i Mana e!

I am anxiously waiting for the heavy rains, And the wind from the front of Pokiikaua, My husband in the twilight of Mana Who accuses me unjustly. I stood and gazed there, Ready to weep As the tears gathered in my eyes. Alas! Alas, my dear companion!"
"Ia wa, lele mai o Kauhi hahau i ka laau, o ka make loa keia, kahea ae o Kahalaopuna: “Aloha oe, ho mai ka ihu, e ke kane, a hele ae au; e hai aku oe i na makua o kaua i kuu aloha.” Olelo iho o Kauhi: “Ka!

Let me kiss you, my husband, ere I depart from this life. Tell our parents of my love for them.” Kauhi then said: “Why do you give your orders when you are thus about to die? I shall kill you.” With that he struck her with the stick and killed her. Kauhi then dragged the dead body and laid it under the lehua tree, covered it over with leaves and ferns, fixed it so that it could not be seen and returned to his home. The spirit of Kahalaopuna flew to the top of the lehua tree and called out in a chant:"
"E kela huakai nui e hele ae la, E hele oukou a i o’u makua E hai aku oukou ua make o Kahalaopuna; [ ] Aia la i ka uka o Pohakea, I ke kumu lehua la o lalo iho.","O ye vast company that is passing by, Go ye to my parents And tell them that Kahalaopuna is dead; [ ] For she lies in the uplands of Pohakea, Beneath the lehua tree."
"Ua ike o Kahalaopuna i ka huakai e hele ana ma ke alanui, nolaila, kana oli ana, a pau ke oli ana a Kahalaopuna, ku iho la ka huakai e hoolohe, i keia leo, he kanaka paha, he makani paha, he uwi laau paha.","Kahalaopuna saw the company of people as they were passing along the road, which was the reason why she chanted. At the close of the chant the people stood and listened, uncertain whether it was the voice of people, the wind, or the squeak caused by the rubbing together of trees."
"Elua oli ana a Kahalaopuna, maopopo ia lakou, he uhane ua make, nolaila, hele mai lakou a hiki ma Manoa. Olelo aku la i na makua, e like me ke oli a Kahalaopuna, a lohe na makua, hele mai la. A hiki lakou i Pohakea, a ke kumu lehua i waiho ai o Kahalaopuna, huai ae la, a hoi mai la i Manoa, hana ia iho la a ola, a like me mamua.","After a while Kahalaopuna chanted a second time, which made the people know that it was the spirit of a dead person; so they continued on their way until they arrived at Manoa, where they informed the parents of Kahalaopuna of what they had heard. Upon hearing this the parents arose and went to the place where their daughter had been killed. When they arrived at Pohakea, they looked for the lehua tree where the body was hidden. At last they found it and they took up the body and with it they returned to Manoa, where they worked over it until she was restored to life and assumed her former self."
"Kui aku la ka lohe ia Kauhi ma Koolau, i ke ola o Kahalaopuna a hele mai la e nana, e ike, e aloha, aole o Kahalaopuna maliu aku, pela ke ano o keia kaao ana.","The news of this restoration of Kahalaopuna to life was carried to Koolau and to the hearing of Kauhi, who came up to see for himself, to pay her a visit and to beg to be loved again; but Kahalaopuna would not listen to him. This is the nature of this legend."
"O Ku ka makuakane, o Hina ka makuahine o Uweuwelekehau, o Wailua i Kauai, ka aina. O Olopana ka mua, o Ku, kona muli, o Hina ko laua hope, he wahine o Hina, noho lakou i Wailua he mau alii no Kauai.

Ma keia hele ana o Ku, ua hahai ko laua pokii wahine o Hina, ia ia, no ke aloha, a haalele ia Olopana ma Kauai.","Ku was the father and Hina was the mother of Uweuwelekehau, and Wailua, Kauai, was the land [of their birth]. Olopana was the first-born, then Ku came next, and the last of the family was Hina, a girl. They lived in Wailua as chiefs and rulers of Kauai. After a while Olopana became displeased with Ku, so Ku set out and journeyed to Piihonua, Hilo, Hawaii, where he made his home. In this journey Hina, the sister, followed Ku, as she was much attached to him, and thus left Olopana in Kauai by himself."
"Moe iho la laua ma ke ano moepio, a noho iho la he kane a he wahine, lilo ae la laua he mau alii no Hilo, o ko laua wai auau o Waianuenue. Ma keia noho ana o laua, loaa o Uweuwelekehau; a i kona wa i hanau ai, kui ka hekili, nei ke olai, olapa ka uwila, kahe ka wai, hele ka ua koko me ka makani. [ ]","After they arrived at Hilo, Ku in accordance with the old custom took Hina to be his wife, as he was of too high a rank to take any other woman to wife; and they became the king and queen of Hilo. Their bathing place was at the pool called Waianuenue. In course of time Hina conceived and gave birth to a male child, who was called Uweuwelekehau. At the birth of the child a great storm swept over the land; the thunder roared, the earth was shaken by a great earthquake, the lightning flashed, the rivers and streams were overflowed, the wind blew and the rain came down in torrents. [ ]"
"A nui o Uweuwelekehau, he maikai kona kino a me ka helehelena ke nana aku, a mea ia pu no kona mau akua elua, o Kane a me Kanaloa. Ua kapu loa kona noho ana, a me kona hale e noho ai, aohe kanaka maalo ma laila, ina ike ia kekahi mea, alaila, o ka make kona hope ponoi.","After Uweuwelekehau was grown up into manhood it was seen that he was very handsome and pleasant to look upon. He was always accompanied by his two gods, Kane and Kanaloa. His bringing up was surrounded by many restrictions; his house was sacred, people not being allowed to pass near it upon pain of certain death."
"A ia Olopana hoi e noho ana ma Kauai, ua hanau kana o Luukia, he kaikamahine, a ua hoohiki ia na Uweuwelekehau e moe, a oia ke kane, no kona lohe ana ua hanau o Hina he heiki kane.

Upon hearing that Hina had given birth to a male child, Olopana made oath that his daughter should marry no one except Uweuwelekehau. Olopana then commanded the people of Kauai that Uweuwelekehau when he comes shall come in a red canoe, having red sails, red paddles, accompanied by large and small men in large and small canoes. When they see such a man come with these different things, then it is the sign of the great chief."
"Noho iho la o Ku ma me Hina, a kokoke i ka malama o Ikuwa pii i ke pani wai oopu, opae, i uka o ke kahawai o Wailuku.

Na Kane laua o Kanaloa keia lilo o Uweuwelekehau i ka wai, ma keia lilo ana, pii aku la kekahi a olelo ia Ku ma, a hoi mai la e uwe ana me ka imi, aohe loaa.","One day near the month of October while Ku and Hina were living in their home, they were possessed with the desire to go up the Wailuku river for oopu and shrimps. In this expedition they took all their servants along with them leaving Uweuwelekehau alone with his attendants. After his parents had departed on their way up the stream Uweuwelekehau set out for the Kalopulepule river to sail his canoe. As he was in the river a small cloud appeared from the sea and came on up till it stood directly above the Wailuku stream when it came down in the form of rain, flooding the whole country and causing the stream to flow in a rush to the ocean, carrying Uweuwelekehau along in its flood. This carrying away of Uweuwelekehau by the flood was caused by Kane and Kanaloa. After he was thus carried out to sea some one went up and informed Ku of the matter and he and his company returned home and a search was made, but the boy could not be found. The parents then mourned for the boy."
"I loko o ke kai, ua hoolilo ia o Uweuwelekehau i ia, e Kane a me Kanaloa, lawe ia aku la a Kauai, loko o ke kaheka kai, kahi e lawaia ia ai ka ia a Luukia, e Papioholoholokahakai, kona kahu ponoi. O kela ia o ka moa, he ia opu keke ke nana iho, oia ke kino ia o Uweuwelekehau.","While in the sea Uweuwelekehau was changed into a fish through the power of Kane and Kanaloa, and by them taken to Kauai and left in a crevice in the rocks near the shore where the fish of Luukia was generally caught by her attendant, Papioholoholokahakai. The fish into which Uweuwelekehau was changed was of the kind called moa , a short stubby fish."
"Moe o Luukia i ka po a ao ae, i aku i ke kahu ia Papioholoholokahakai: “E iho oe e kuu ia na kakou no ka aina kakahiaka, aohe ia a kakou e ai ai.” Iho aku la o Papioholoholokahakai me ka upena a hiki, lawaia iho la; aohe ia.

Nolaila, kahea aku o Luukia ia Uweuwelekehau, e hele mai a kokoke; ia wa ua hui laua, aka, aole nae he moe kino, no ka mea, ua paa i ka mana o Kane a me Kanaloa.","Early the next morning when Luukia awoke from her sleep she told her attendant, Papioholoholokahakai, to go down and catch her some fish for breakfast, as there was none ready for her morning meal. Papioholoholokahakai took up his net and proceeded to the beach. After three casts of his net he found that he had caught nothing. Thinking that his charge would get angry with him he again made another attempt, when to his delight he caught a small stubby fish, and upon closer inspection he saw that it was a good fish. He then took the fish and placed it into a calabash with some water and proceeded home. When he arrived in the presence of Luukia, he handed her the calabash which contained the fish. Luukia looked at the fish and was made glad by the shape of the fish and took and gave it to her servants with the order that it be given good care. After the lapse of one day, on the second day, while Luukia and her attendants were asleep, the fish transformed itself into a human being, through the power of Kane [ ] and Kanaloa. When Luukia and her attendants woke up they saw a handsome young man coming to them and immediately Luukia fell in love with him, for he was indeed very comely and pleasant to look upon. Luukia called Uweuwelekehau to come closer, whereupon they came together, though they did not know each other, for Kane and Kanaloa disapproved of their living together at this time."
"Ia laua e noho ana ma ia ano, lohe aku la o Olopana, ua loaa ke kane a Luukia, aole hoi o kana kane i makemake ai o Uweuwelekehau, nolaila, houluulu ia o Kauai a puni e hele mai ma kahi o Olopana e nana ai ia Luukia a me Uweuwelekehau. A akoakoa mai la na mea a pau loa i mua o Olopana, ninau aku la o Olopana ia Luukia: “O ke kane o ka makua mahea oe?” “Ma ke kane au,” wahi a Luukia; i aku o Olopana i kona ilamuku, e lawe ae oe i ko Luukia mau pono a pau loa, a waiho olohelohe iho ke kino, pela ke kane, a koe ka malo.

A ua kipaku o Olopana ia laua e hoi i Mana e noho ai, he moku akua ia, aohe mea noho ilaila.","While they were living in this way, Olopana heard that Luukia was living with a husband; so he became very angry because of the promise he had made, that Luukia should have no one else but Uweuwelekehau for her husband [not knowing that this very person was the man of his choice]. Olopana then gathered all the people of Kauai and ordered them to come before him to hear what he had to say about Luukia and her lover, and to see for themselves who he was. As soon as the people came together in his presence, he asked Luukia: “Which would you rather have, the husband or your father?” “I will take my husband,” said Luukia. Olopana then ordered his chief officer: “Take off everything from Luukia and leave her naked; also take off everything from her husband except his malo.” Olopana thought they were deserving of this ill treatment because his daughter had disobeyed him. Olopana then told the people of the whole of Kauai not to take these two into their homes nor give them food or clothing. He also commanded that they go to Mana and live, a place of spirits; no human beings lived there."
"Nolaila, hele aku la o Luukia me Uweuwelekehau, mai Wailua aku a hiki i ke kula o Lihue, uwe iho la o Luukia me ke kaniuhu, no ka hele wale o ke kino aohe kapa. I aku o Uweuwelekehau: “Mai uwe oe, e hoomanawanui a kela puu, aia i laila ka pa-u.” A hiki laua, e ahu ana ka pa-u a me ke kapa, i laila, pau ka hemahema i ke kapa a me ka pa-u. Uwe hou o Luukia o ka pololi; olelo aku ke kane: “E hoomanawanui a kela puu (oia o Kahoaea) aia i laila ka ai a me ka ia.” A hiki laua i laila, e ahu ana ka ai a me ka ia; ai iho la laua a maona, hele aku la laua a hiki i Mana, noho iho la.","Luukia and Uweuwelekehau therefore left Wailua and journeyed to the land to which they were commanded to go and live. When they reached the plains of Lihue, Luukia began to weep and to show signs of complaint against her father for forcing her to go naked. When Uweuwelekehau saw this he said: “Don’t weep; have patience until we reach that hill, where you will find a pa-u.” When they arrived at the hill, they found several pa-u and all manner of kapas, which furnished them with all their wants and thus covered their nakedness. After they left the place Luukia again began weeping because she was hungry. Her husband then said to her: “Have a little patience until we reach that hill, Kahoaea , where we will find food and meat.” Upon arriving at the hill they found food and meat which they ate until they were satisfied. From this place they continued on their way until they came to Mana, where they made their home."
"No Mana. He aina akua o Mana, aohe kanaka o ia aina, he aina ai ole, aohe mea ulu, he aina nahelehele, he aina mehameha; nolaila, makau na kanaka ia aina o pau i ka ai ia e ke akua, a nolaila o Luukia me ke kane i kiola ia ai i laila.","Mana, as has been said, was the land where the spirits lived; no human beings lived there; no food of any description grew in the place; the only things that grew in the place were wild shrubs and weeds. It was also a place avoided by people, lest they be destroyed by the spirits, and it was for these reasons that Luukia and her husband were sent here."
"I ka po, moe iho la laua, ia wa, ku ana ka hale, ka ai, na holoholona, na mea a pau loa, a ao ae, nana iho la o Luukia i keia mau mea.","During the night, as they slept, a house was built over them, food was provided, animals were brought to the place and all their needs were supplied them. When they woke up the next morning Luukia was surprised to see these different things. The two lived on in peace in the place from this time on."
"Pela laua i noho ai i Mana, o ka poe hoi e holo ana ma ka waa ike mai la i ke ahi e a ana i uka, pae mai la, hookipa o Uweuwelekehau i ka ai a me ka ia, ke kapa, pela kona ume ana i ka naau o na mea a pau loa e holo aku ana i Mana.

No ka mea, ua hai o Uweuwelekehau i kona moolelo ia Luukia a me na kanaka, a ua hai no hoi i kona inoa ponoi, o ia o Uweuwelekehau. Ma keia lohe ana o Olopana, o kana keiki no keia kane a Luukia o ia kona kumu i hele ai e ike, a e hoolilo i alii no Kauai.","When the fishermen who were out in their canoes saw the light burning they came ashore and were entertained by Uweuwelekehau, food and meat were given them as well as kapas and other things. Through his great kindness he stole the hearts of [ ] these people who came to Mana, causing many of them to come and live there, and through their labor turned the waste land into a rich and comfortable place. By this time these doings were reported to Olopana who was still at Wailua. In order therefore to see these things for himself and also to make up with his daughter and son-in-law, for news had also come to him that this person was Uweuwelekehau himself, because the latter had informed his wife and the people in Mana as to his identity, Olopana set out for Mana, with the purpose not only to make up, but to make his son-in-law and daughter the king and queen of Kauai."
"Kui aku la ka lohe i Hawaii a lohe o Ku me Hina, a holo mai la, he waa nui, he waa iki, ke kanaka nui, he kanaka iki, he waa ula, he pea ula, he kaula ula, he hoe ula, he noho ana ula, he ka ula, he kanaka ula, a me na mea a pau loa.

They therefore came to Kauai with their servants, in large and small canoes, having red sails, red cords, red paddles, red seats, red bailing cups and red men, and with everything needed for the voyage. When the people from Hawaii arrived they were met by a great host of people at Mana and great festivities were had. That night for the first time were the two covered by the same kapa, for Kane and Kanaloa were pleased to remove the kapu placed over their charge. Uweuwelekehau and Luukia were at this time declared the king and queen of Kauai. Among their first acts to commemorate their great fortune were the planting of the grove of coconut trees at Kaunalewa and the building of the temple of Lolomauna. This is the end of this legend."

Aka, ua komo ka makau o Keawenuiaumi ia Kalaepuni, a manao iho la e mahuka mai na maka aku o Kalaepuni.","Kalanipo and Kamaelekapu were the father and mother of Kalaepuni and Kalaehina. Kalaepuni was the elder and Kalaehina was the younger. They were born and raised in Holualoa, Kona, during the reign of Keawenuiaumi, king of Hawaii. Regarding Kalaepuni: he was a very mischievous boy and one who was without fear. At the age of six he was able to whip all his playmates and his strength developed from that time on until he reached the age of twenty years, at which time Kalaepuni became famous over the whole of Hawaii for his great strength. At twenty he determined to kill all the young chiefs of Hawaii, those who were of very high blood as well as those of low blood, both big and small, even the mere sucklings. In his plan to [ ] kill all the chiefs he did not intend to kill Keawenuiaumi , because, as he reasoned, Keawenuiaumi was already well on in years. But Keawenuiaumi was afraid of Kalaepuni and he made his plans to escape and to get out from the presence of Kalaepuni."
"Mahope o laila, holo aku la o Kalaepuni me na lawaia a Keawenuiaumi, ma waho ae o Kalahiki, he kupalupalu mano ka lakou lawaia.

A e hoolilo au i na mano a pau, i lehu i loko o kuu poho lima.”","Shortly after the events narrated above, Kalaepuni went out fishing with some of Keawenuiaumi’s fishermen to the fishing grounds outside of Kalahiki; they went out shark fishing. After some of the bait was thrown out the sharks began to gather under the canoe, when the baited hooks were let down and several sharks were caught and hauled into the canoe. While Keawenuiaumi’s men were hauling the sharks up, Kalaepuni jumped out amongst the sharks that were gathered under the canoe and began to fight them, killing them all. After killing all the sharks, Kalaepuni began boasting, saying: “Henceforth I shall use my hands as hooks for catching sharks and shall make all sharks as dust in my hands.”"

Alaila, waiho iho la ia i kana olelo kaena, penei: “E hoolilo ana au i o’u mau lima i ko’i kua waa no Hilo.”","After they had been fishing for some time they returned and landed their canoe at Honaunau where a large kou tree was standing. This was a very large tree requiring three men to span its girth. Kalaepuni, however, took hold of the tree and pulled it up by the roots as though it was but a blade of grass, so resistless was it. After pulling up the tree he again boasted, saying: “I am going to turn my hands into an axe for the cutting down of trees for canoes in Hilo.”"
"A no keia mau mea a Kalaepuni i hoike ai imua o ke ’lii, o Keawenuiaumi, makau iho la o Keawenuiaumi, a mahuka aku la a noho ma ke kua o ka mauna o Hualalai , ma waena o Maunaloa a me ka mauna o Kona. Ua kaulana ia wahi i noho ia e Keawenuiaumi, o ia o Ahu-a-Umi a hiki i keia la, e waiho la ma ka mauna o Kona, ma ka Hikina o Kona.","Because of these feats of great strength shown by Kalaepuni before the king, Keawenuiaumi became more and more afraid of him and he went and hid himself in a place back of the Hualalai mountain, between Maunaloa and the Kona mountain. The place after this became famous because it was here that Keawenuiaumi lived in hiding, near the Ahu-a-Umi as can be seen to this day, lying back of the Kona mountain and in the eastern part of that district."
"Mamua ae o ka mahuka ana o Keawenuiaumi, waiho iho la ia i kana olelo i kekahi kauwa ana, ia Maunaloa: “Eia wau ke hele nei, i noho oe a i hiki mai o Kalaepuni, olelo aku oe, ua make au.” Ae aku la ke kauwa, hele aku la o Keawenuiaumi a noho i kahi i olelo mua ia maluna ae nei. A hele o Keawenuiaumi, hiki o Kalaepuni a ka hale, ninau ia Maunaloa, olelo mai o Maunaloa: “Ua make.” Alaila, lawe ae la o Kalaepuni ia Hawaii i loko o kona lima, a lilo iho la ko Keawenuiaumi noho ana alii ia ia.","Before Keawenuiaumi went off to hide himself, he left word with one of his servants, Maunaloa by name, as follows: “I am now on my way. If Kalaepuni comes while you are here, tell him that I am dead.” The servant consented to do this. Keawenuiaumi then departed on his way to the place mentioned above. After the departure of Keawenuiaumi, Kalaepuni arrived at the house and asked Maunaloa as to the whereabouts of the king. Maunaloa answered that the king was dead. Kalaepuni then took charge of the whole island of Hawaii and he reigned as king in place of Keawenuiaumi."
"Ia Keawenuiaumi e noho ana i ka mauna, olelo aku la ia i kana kahuna, ia Mokupane: “E anaana oe ia Kalaepuni a make, i lilo hou au i alii no Hawaii a puni.” Mahope o keia olelo a ke ’lii i ke kahuna, hoouna aku la o Mokupane i elua kanaha kanaka i Kahoolawe, maluna o na waa, e kohi i punawai, he umi anana ka hohonu, a e hoopuni o [ ] luna i na pohaku nunui loa.

The name of [ ] the land where they were to dig the well is known as Keanapou and it is there to this day. After the well was dug and the rocks put in place, an old man and his wife were placed in charge of it; they were fisher folks."
"A makaukau ka hoi o na kanaha kanaka elua i Hawaii, olelo aku o Mokupane, ke kahuna i na elemakule: “E i noho olua a i hiki mai he kanaka nui, ua aki ia ka lauoho, ua like ka loihi me ka pu o ke olona, alaila, o ke kanaka ia nona keia punawai, a maanei oia e make ai.

When he comes give him all your fish so that after he shall have eaten the fish he will be very thirsty. When he asks of you for some water don’t give him any, but direct him to this well.” After these instructions were imparted by the priest, he and the men returned to Hawaii, where the priest began to invoke of the gods for the death of Kalaepuni."
"Mahope o keia pule ana a Mokupane, ua kui ae la ke kaulana o ke ku ana o ka mano ma Kauhola i Kohala, ma na wahi o Hawaii a puni, a lohe o Kalaepuni, kupu ae la kona manao, e hele e lealea me ka mano ma Kauhola, no ka mea, ua olelo ia, o kana puni ka hakaka me ka mano.","Soon after Mokupane began on his prayers it was reported all over Hawaii that great schools of sharks were being seen daily at Kauhola off the coast of Kohala. When this was reported to Kalaepuni he at once entertained a strong desire to go to Kauhola and have some sport with the sharks, as it was his chief delight to kill them."
"A hiki ia i Kohala, a hehi i luna o Kauhola, e paapu ana na kanaka i laila, e nana ana i ka mano, ia wa, lele o Kalaepuni i lalo a hakaka me ka mano, nui na mano i make ia ia, ma keia hakaka ana.

He ai no koonei, o ka ai kamaaiana no, o ke kupala.”","After Kalaepuni had arrived at Kohala and set foot at Kauhola he saw a large number of people gathered at the place looking at the sharks. When Kalaepuni saw them he jumped in and began to fight the sharks, killing a good many of them. While Kalaepuni was busily engaged in his fight with the sharks he did not notice how he was being carried away from land by a strong current into the channel of Alanuihaha. After being in the sea for three nights and three days he landed at Keanapou in Kahoolawe. When he reached the shore he looked about him and saw a small house, near by, to which he then went. Upon arrival at the place he looked and saw an aged couple who greeted him, which greeting he returned. The old people then asked him: “Did you come from the sea?” “Yes,” said Kalaepuni. “I have been three days and nights in the sea before I landed here.” Kalaepuni then asked the old people: “Have you any food?” The old people said: “No, there is no food in this place. The only food that you can get in this place is what is brought here in canoes. When any one comes from Honuaula or Ukumehame, then we get food. The only food that grows here is the kupala .”"
"Alawa ae la o Kalaepuni i luna, a ike i na haka ia e kaulai ana, ninau aku la: “Na wai kela ia?” “Na maua no,” wahi a na elemakule.

[ ]","Kalaepuni then looked up and saw a shelf with some fish being put out to be dried and asked: “Who owns that fish?” “We do,” answered the old people. Kalaepuni then asked them: “May I have some fish?” The old people then gave him all the fish and Kalaepuni began to eat them until he had finished the whole lot. Kalaepuni then asked: “Is this all the fish you have?” The old people said: “We have two calabashes of pickled ones left.” Kalaepuni then took the fish from the two calabashes and devoured them all. After this Kalaepuni became very thirsty and so asked of the old people for some water. The aged couple then said: “We have no water. The only water we have here is the salt water. Fresh water can only be had after a rain storm; but salt water is our only water; it is in a well.” After this Kalaepuni went and climbed down the well to take a drink. [ ]"
"A inu o Kalaepuni i ka wai i lalo o ka lua, olokaa aku la na elemakule i ka pohaku nui, a paa ke kua o Kalaepuni, oni ae la no lele ka pohaku, olokaa no laua nei i ka pohaku a kokoke e piha ka lua, owala ae la no o Kalaepuni lele liilii ka pohaku.

After the back of Kalaepuni was covered with rocks he would move and the rocks would roll off; but the two kept on rolling the rocks until the well was almost filled up, without killing Kalaepuni. In all this Kalaepuni still kept on drinking and as the water was covered over with the rocks he could get but very little."
"Ma keia hana a na elemakule ia Kalaepuni, olelo aku o Kalaepuni: “E make ana olua ia’u.” Oni ae la o Kalaepuni mai loko ae o na pohaku paakiki, a hemo ae la, ike na elemakule, e make ana laua ia Kalaepuni ke pii ae i luna, nolaila, holo aku la ka elemakule kane.

When the old people saw that they would get killed if Kalaepuni could get to the top, the old man ran away. When the old woman saw this she called out: “Are you going to run away? Is it not best to continue the fight until the enemy is killed? Do you suppose that you could save yourself by running? You will get killed if you run and you will get killed if you stay, for with this great strength none will ever escape.” With all this the old man kept on running and he never once turned back. The old woman, however, kept on rolling down the rocks till one happened to strike Kalaepuni on the head killing him."
"Ua maopopo ia kakou ma ka nana ana i ko Kalaepuni kaao, he kanaka koa loa ia a me ka makau ole, he kanaka ikaika loa, a ma keia kaao ana, no kona muli iho, oia o Kalaehina.

In this chapter we will speak of his younger brother Kalaehina. Before the death of Kalaepuni at Keanapou, on Kahoolawe, and while he was still king of Hawaii in place of Keawenuiaumi, he ordered the people from one end of Kona to the other to go with Kalaehina and haul down canoes at Kapua, a place in South Kona next to Kau. In this expedition Kalaehina was placed in charge. There were as many canoes as there were minor districts in Kona. When they arrived at the place where the canoes were lying, there were six of them, there being six minor districts in Kona, Kalaehina then said to the people: “Ye servants of my older brother, Kalaepuni, hear me: the district that will get its canoe down to the shore first, its people shall be the favorites of Kalaepuni.”"
"Kauo aku la ka okana mua i ka lakou waa, a hiki ma kekahi kipapali, o Nawaahookui ka inoa, eono iwilei kona kiekie, pela no ka hana a pau na waa eono, aohe waa i hiki loa i kai. Nolaila, haalele lakou i na waa, a hoi aku la a hiki i mua o Kalaepuni, ninau mai la o Kalaepuni: “Auhea na waa?” Olelo aku o Kalaehina: “Ua kauo mai nei makou a kahi i haalele aku nei, he wahi kipapali, aia i laila kahi i ili ai na waa a eono.” A lohe o Kalaepuni, huhu loa iho la ia i kona kaikaina, olelo aku la: “Aole anei au i hoonoho aku ia oe i luna maluna o na kanaka a pau, a no ke aha la oe i hooponopono ole ai e like me ka’u olelo ia oe? Nolaila, o oe hookahi ke pii e kauo mai i na waa, o na [ ] kanaka a pau e noho lakou aole make pii, a i hiki ole na waa ia oe, alaila, kau ia oe i kanaka no ka heiau.”","Upon hearing this the people of the respective districts then began to haul the canoes until they came to a cliff about six yards high at a place called Nawaahookui where all six canoes got stuck fast, not one being able to get down to the beach. Therefore the people left the canoes where they were and returned to Kalaepuni. When Kalaepuni saw the people he asked: “Where are the canoes?” Kalaehina replied: “We hauled them until we could not get them past a certain place by a cliff and we have left them there all stuck fast.” When Kalaepuni heard this he became very angry at his younger brother and said to him: “Did I not put you over all the men? Why did you not make them carry out my orders? You must therefore go and haul them down by [ ] yourself. The rest of the people shall not go to assist you, and if you will not be able to get the canoes down you shall be a sacrifice for the temple.”"
"A lohe o Kalaehina i keia mau olelo a kona kaikuaana, makau loa iho la ia, i ka hiki ole o na waa ia ia, noonoo iho la ia mai ka po a ao, mai ke ao a po, hele aku la ia a kahi o na waa i waiho ai, nana iho la a haalele, hele aku la ia a hiki i Kau.

He, however, began to study the matter and all that night and the next day he spent in making plans as to how to overcome this most difficult matter. After at last hitting on a plan he went up to the place where the canoes were lying, took a look at them and proceeded to Kau. When he arrived in Kau he deceived the people, saying: “Ye people of Kau, the king, Kalaepuni has given me orders to tell you to go and haul the canoes down to the beach.” When the people heard this they all started for Kapua. Upon arriving at the place, the people lifted up the canoes, carried them to a place from where they could be dragged to the beach and placed in the sea; five of them were then paddled to Keauhou, where Kalaepuni was stopping, while Kalaehina followed behind with the other canoe on his back, coming by the upper road to Kainaliu. When Kalaepuni saw this he praised his younger brother for being so strong."
"A hiki mai ka la hookahakaha o ke ’lii o Kalaepuni, ia la i hoike ai o Kalaehina i kona ikaika i mua o na mea a pau loa. Lalau iho la ia hookahi waa o na waa eono i kauo ia mai ai, a pahee aku la i loko o ke kai, me he ihe la, a me he mea ole la ia ia.

Kalaehina took up one of the six canoes and threw it into the sea as though it was a spear, without much effort. A few days after this Kalaehina saw the king’s chief steward chopping firewood, he picked up a stick of wood and struck it with his head, breaking the stick into small bits, thus making the hard ohia appear as nothing."
"No keia ikaika o Kalaehina, olelo mai o Kalaepuni: “E kuu kaikaina, pomaikai kaua, i ko kaua ikaika nui. Lilo ae nei au i alii no Hawaii nei ma kuu ikaika, e aho e holo oe i Maui e luku i na pua alii o laila, a e noho alii ma ko Kamalalawalu wahi.” Ae aku o Kalaehina i ka olelo a kona kaikuaana, a Kalaepuni, noho iho la ia a hala na la kapu heiau o Hawaii, a hala ia, holo aku la ia i Maui.","When Kalaepuni saw how strong Kalaehina, his brother, was, he said: “My younger brother, we are indeed fortunate because of our great strength. I have become king of Hawaii through my great strength, now I think it well of you to go to Maui and kill all the offspring of the chiefs of that island so that you can reign in place of Kamalalawalu.” Kalaehina agreed to this request of his brother. At the close of the kapu days set apart for the sacrifices of the temple in Hawaii he set sail for Maui."
"A hiki o Kalaehina ma Hana i Maui, ia wa, he aha mokomoko ka ke ’lii o Maui, a Kamalalawalu ma ka puu o Kauiki, e akoakoa ana na kanaka he lehulehu, me ka puloulou kapu o ke ’lii, ae aku la o Kalaehina maluna o ia kapu, lalau iho la i ka puloulou, a lilo i mea ole i loko o kona mau lima.

Great crowds of people were gathered and the kapu sticks separating the king’s palace from the people were put up. When Kalaehina saw them, he took them down and boldly entered into the place reserved for the king. When Kamalalawalu the king saw these doings of Kalaehina he ordered the people to jump on Kalaehina and kill him. As the people were about to place their hands on him, he swept them off their feet as though they were but ants, killing a large number of them. At sight of this great strength, Kamalalawalu was so afraid that he escaped to a pool of water at Waianapanapa which lies in Honokolani, Hana, and this pool of water is there to this day."
"Lilo ae la o Kalaehina i alii no Maui, ma ko Kamalalawalu noho alii ana, kui aku la keia kaulana mai Hawaii a Niihau, i ka ikaika o Kalaehina a me kona noho alii ana no Maui ma kahi o Kamalalawalu. [ ]",Kalaehina then became the king of Maui and he reigned in the place of Kamalalawalu. This fact was reported from Hawaii to Niihau and his great strength and succession as king of Maui was the one topic of conversation.
"Oia ko Kauai kanaka ikaika loa, a oia ke noho ana ma ko Ola wahi, ko Kauai alii nui. A lohe oia i ko Kalaehina ikaika, makemake iho la oia e holo mai e hakaka me Kalaehina.

When rumors of the great strength of Kalaehina reached him he became very anxious to meet Kalaehina. After making his preparations he set sail from Kauai and first landed on Oahu; from Oahu he set sail for Maui, landing at Honuaula, where he left his canoe and walked to Kipahulu. That night he slept at a house where he was befriended."
"Ninau mai la kamaaina: “Mahea kau wahi hele?

I am going to Hana and from there I will make a complete circuit of the island of Maui. After that I shall return to Kauai.” The people then said: “What a great pity that such a good looking man like you should be killed by our ill-tempered king Kalaehina. You had better return home.” Kapakohana said: “Will he then get angry with a person who goes quietly along the highway?” “Yes, he will get angry. He is the most violent tempered man and is also very powerful. He has destroyed most all the chiefs and warriors on the island and he pays homage to no one. Our king, Kamalalawalu, has escaped for fear of him.” Kapakohana then questioned them further: “What has he done to show that he is powerful?” “Here, he can pull up large trees by the roots, and he chops his firewood with his head when the stewards act slow. On the king’s labor days the people are not allowed to talk for they all fear him. That’s it that you may know.” Kapakohana then replied: “He is not so very strong then, seeing that his main strength is only in the pulling up of trees. With a few blows from my fists he will run away.” The people with whom he was staying said: “You will not have any chance against him for he is very strong.” Kapakohana remarked: “I would be pleased to meet him in combat if he will say so.”"
"Moe iho la lakou a ao ia po, hele aku la o Kapakohana a hiki ma Kaiwiopele i Hana, ma keia hele ana o Kapakohana, hahai pu aku la na kamaaina o kona hale i moe ai, e ike i ko laua hakaka ana.","That night Kapakohana spent with his friends. On the next day he proceeded on his way and arrived at Kaiwiopele in Hana. In this journey the people with whom he had spent the night accompanied him, for they were anxious to see the combat."

He then called out in a loud voice: “I will tear you up! I will tear you up!” When Kalaehina was making this threat, the people took pity on [ ] Kapakohana, for they were sure that he would be killed. Kapakohana, however, fearlessly held his ground. When he saw the people working and not a word could be heard from them, he knew that what he had heard was indeed true. Kalaehina then prepared himself to grapple with Kapakohana. When Kapakohana saw that Kalaehina was about to take hold of him he called out to the people to stop their work."

Lawe pu mai la o Kapakohana i ke a auwae o Kalaehina a hoike ae la i na kanaka o uka, maopopo iho la, ua make o Kalaehina.","Kalaehina then grabbed hold of Kapakohana and held him. Kapakohana also reached out and held Kalaehina fast, this being Kapakohana’s favorite method [of fighting]. The two then began to wrestle; first one would be on top and then the other would be on top. This was kept up until Kapakohana was almost exhausted. While they were wrestling, Kapakohana was at the same time studying how he could overcome his opponent; at last he hit upon a plan, and that was to push his opponent to the cliff of Kaihalulu, at the sea shore, near to Kapueokahi in Hana. When they were directly on the cliff, Kapakohana made one last effort and they both rolled over the cliff and fell into the sea, both going under. After a while Kapakohana came up with the dead body of Kalaehina. Kapakohana then proceeded to cut out the lower jaw of Kalaehina and showed it to the people who were gathered at the beach. When they saw the jaw of Kalaehina, they knew then that he was indeed dead."
"Mahope o ka make ana o Kalaehina, lilo ae la o Kamalalawalu i alii no Maui, e like me kona ano mamua. O na kanaka o Hana, kaohi mai la lakou ia Kapakohana e noho i alii no lakou, e like me Kalaehina, hoole aku o Kapakohana.","After the death of Kalaehina, Kamalalawalu again became the king of Maui and took upon himself his former powers. The people of Hana urged upon Kapakohana that he remain with them as their chief and that he rule over them in place of Kalaehina; but he refused."
"Alaila, hoi aku la o Kapakohana, a loaa na waa ona ma Honuaula e kau ana, ee aku la ia a holo i ka moana, a pae ma Molokai, i ka lae o Kalaau, moe a ao ae, holo a pae mai ma Waikiki i Ulukou. Ia po a kau i Pokai ma Waianae, moe a kupono ka la, holo aku la a molehulehu, komo ma Wailua i Kauai, a pae aku la i uka.","A few days after the death of Kalaehina, Kapakohana returned by way of Honuaula to the place where his canoe was moored, boarded it and he set out for Molokai landing at the Kalaau point, where he spent the night. Early the next day he again set out and landed at Ulukou in Waikiki; from this place he continued on his way and by night of the same day he landed at Pokai, in Waianae. On the next morning he again set out and by dusk he entered the mouth of the Wailua river, in Kauai, where he landed."
"Ia lakou e makaukau ana e paina, hiki ana ka olohe aikanaka o Hanakapiai, e hele ana e ai i kanaka o Wailua. A ike o Kapakohana i ka olohe, olelo aku la ia: “Ea, heaha kau o onei o ka hele ana mai, aole oe i ike, owau ko Kauai nei kanaka ikaika i ka hakaka, a heaha kou mea i makau ole ai i ka hele maanei?” Olelo mai ka olohe: “Aole au i ike ia oe, a me kou ikaika aole hoi au i hele mai e hoolohe i kau olelo, he hana okoa ko’u mea i hiki mai ai ianei.” Ninau aku o Kapakohana: “Heaha ia hana au?” Wahi a ka olohe: “O kuu ai aku ia ia oe a pau, o kuu nau aku i ko iwi a waliwali, a okaoka, a lehu.” I aku o Kapakohana: “Ua makaukau wau ia mau mea au e olelo mai la.” Ia wa, lalau o Kapakohana i ka olohe, me ka puliki a paa loa i kona kino, aka, he [ ] mea ole ia i ka olohe.

When Kapakohana saw the hairless cannibal he said: “What do you want coming here? Do you not know that I am the strongest fighting man on Kauai? Why are you not afraid of coming to this place?” The robber answered: “I don’t know who you are, nor your strength. I did not come here to hear you talk. I came here on a different errand.” Kapakohana then asked him: “What is your errand?” The hairless cannibal answered: “To eat you up first and then chew your bones until they are as fine as dust.” Kapakohana then said: “I am ready for you then.” Kapakohana then grabbed hold of the robber around the body and held him [ ] fast, but this was nothing to the cannibal. They then began to wrestle until Kapakohana was held by the cannibal and was so exhausted that he began to grow faint. Kapakohana, realizing that he would get killed if they were to keep on with the fight, asked of the cannibal that they become friends and to come and go to visit each other and partake of cooked taro."
"Ma keia olelo a Kapakohana, ua hookuu ka olohe aikanaka o Hanakapiai ia Kapakohana, manao iho la ka olohe, he olelo oiaio keia a Kapakohana, walewale kona manao, a hemahema kona moe ana i ka po.

Thinking that Kapakohana was honest in his intentions the robber cannibal became careless at nights and grew less watchful. One night while he was fast asleep, Kapakohana and two forties of his men came and surrounded the house of the cannibal with nets and ropes and prepared to catch him."
"Ala mai la ka olohe, a noho i luna, me ka noonoo i kona moe ana, lohe aku la ia i ka nehe o na kanaka a me ka halulu, kiei aku la ia a ike, he upena ka mea e hana ia nei mawaho, lele ae la ia a luna o ka hale, wawahi ae la ma kaupoku, a hemo ae la ke poo ma waho.

He then looked out and saw the people setting their nets; he then studied a plan as to the best means of getting out. Instead of trying to get out by the doorway he climbed up to the roof and tore open the top of the house and made his escape by taking hold of a branch of the kukui tree which grew close to the house. There he sat and listened to the talk and the orders that were being given by Kapakohana, to make ready and set the house on fire so as to kill the hairless cannibal. When he heard this, he said to himself: “I am going to kill you all and eat you up, from the smallest to the largest of you.” He then jumped down from the tree and crawled up to the men and began killing and eating them. He kept this up until he came up to Kapakohana. When Kapakohana saw the cannibal he jumped at him and held him by the throat. The fight was continued from the rest of that night and all the next day until just as the sun was sinking in the sea the cannibal was at last made fast and held to the ground. Kapakohana then reached out for his war club and struck the cannibal in the temple a couple of times, depriving him of the further enjoyment of the heat of the sun, thus killing him."
"Poalo ae la o Kapakohana i na maka o ka olohe, i mea kupalu mano, lole ae la i na iwi i mea kau paipu, a o ke kino okoa hoi, kaumaha ia aku la na ke ’kua i luna o ka heiau. Pela i pau ai ke kaua ana o Kapakohana me ka olohe. [ ]",Kapakohana then took out the eyes of the cannibal to be used as bait for shark fishing. He next stripped the bones clean and used them for a place to hang up his calabashes. The rest of the body was then carried to the temple and placed on the altar as a sacrifice. Thus was the cannibal killed by Kapakohana. [ ]
"No Kukuipahu i Kohala o Kapunohu, o Kukuipahu ke kaikoeke, o Kanikaa ke ’kua, o Hoomaoe ka lawaia.

Kukuipahu was also the name of his brother-in-law. Kanikaa was the name of his god and Hoomaoe was the name of his fisherman. Hoomaoe was a great fisherman. On coming home one day after he had been out fishing and had caught ten fish, he was met by the god named Kanikaa. Kanikaa asked of Hoomaoe: “You seem tired. You must have plenty of fish to eat. You must have caught a good many.” Hoomaoe answered: “Indeed I have some fish.” “How many?” asked Kanikaa. “Ten.” “Let me have some of them?” Hoomaoe gave him some; but Kanikaa kept on asking until Hoomaoe had given him all the ten fish. After Kanikaa had received the last fish, he knew that Hoomaoe was a very kind-hearted man. Kanikaa then said to Hoomaoe: “I came with the intention of eating you up; but because of your great kindness to me, I will therefore save you and I shall henceforth be your god.”"

While he was throwing his spear on the course, Kapunohu came along and upon seeing the spear he picked it up and ran off swiftly with it. When Kanikaa saw Kapunohu run off with his spear he gave chase with the idea of killing Kapunohu if he should catch him. In running away with the spear, Kapunohu ran toward upper Kawaihae with Kanikaa hot after him. Upon coming to an underground tunnel Kapunohu entered it with Kanikaa right along behind. Kapunohu went out at the other end and soon after Kanikaa also went out. The chase was kept up for some time till at last they agreed to make friends. Because of this fact this place is to this day called Kaholeiwai, meaning, that it is the place where the winds from the southwest meet in conflict with the winds from the northeast. This, their battle ground, is known as Kaholeiwai. One wind cannot overcome the other and a distinct line lies at this place, which has always been famous for this fact; and both winds have continued the fight from that day to this and it will always be kept up."
"Ma keia launa ana o Kanikaa me Kapunohu, ua lilo ia Kapunohu ka ihe a Kanikaa, o Kanikawi, a ua lilo no hoi o Kanikaa he ’kua no Kapunohu.","When Kanikaa and Kapunohu became friends, Kapunohu kept Kanikaa’s spear, Kanikawi, and Kanikaa became the god of Kapunohu."

On the morning after his return, while their morning meal was being prepared, the sister told Kapunohu: “Go and take your morning meal with your [ ] brother-in-law.” This was because the women were not allowed to eat with the men. When Kapunohu arrived at the eating house he took up the wash basin and washed his hands. While he was doing this Kukuipahu asked: “After your hands are washed what are you going to eat?” Kapunohu replied: “I was called to come.” Kukuipahu then asked of those within the house from one end to the other, if anybody had called Kapunohu to come. The people within the house all denied ever calling him. This was of course meant for an insult and Kapunohu felt it deeply. Kapunohu then went back to his sister and told her of his treatment. Shortly after this Kapunohu went off feeling bitter toward his brother-in-law."
"Pii aku la o Kapunohu a hiki i uka o ia aina, e ku ana ka lalani wiliwili, he laau nunui ia me he kukui la kona kino, ke nui ame ke kiekie, he laau oluolu no nae, aole paakiki loa e like me ke kukui.

These trees were of large size, resembling the kukui trees, but very light and not as hard as the wood of the kukui. Kapunohu then, with an idea of testing his strength, threw his spear at the first tree and the spear went through them all. It is said there were eight hundred of the trees which stood in a straight row. He made a clean hole in each tree, all in one thrust."
"A pau keia hana a Kapunohu, pii aku la ia a loaa elua mau elemakule e mahiai ana i ke alanui, o Nahuluaina ko laua aina e mahiai ana.

The land which they were cultivating is known as Nahuluaina. Kapunohu then said to them: “Say, old men, I want you to each take a flag and run with all your might away from each other and where you stop, that shall be the boundary of your lands.” The names of the old men were Pioholowai and Kukuikiikii. They each took up a flag and ran with all their might. In their effort to cover as much ground as possible, Pioholowai did not go very far before he became exhausted and so planted his flag; because of this his land was short and the name of that land is Pioholowai to this day, after his name. Kukuikiikii, on the other hand, ran and covered much more ground before he planted his flag, consequently his land was much larger, and the name of the land is Kukuikiikii to this day, after the old man who owned it. Because of the mode of the division of these two lands all the following pieces of lands are cut off short and do not run clear up to the mountains: Hualoa 1, Hualoa 2, Kealahewa 1, Kealahewa 2, Kealahewa 3, Hukiaa 1, Hukiaa 2, Kokoiki 1, Kokoiki 2, Puuepa 1, Puuepa 2, Kapakai, Upolu , Honoipu, Puakea 1, Puakea 2, Puakea 3, and Kamilo. Those lands are bounded today as they were made at the time this story relates. They do not run clear to the mountains like the other lands in the district of Kohala."

From this place he continued on his way until he came to Puaiole, in Aamakao where a woman by the name of Aamakao was living and he stayed here two days. From this last place he continued on his way until he arrived at Niulii, where the chief of that section of Kohala was living, a man by the same name, Niulii. This chief had under him all the [ ] lands included in between the heights of Awini and the Wainaia gulch; and from the Wainaia gulch to Kahua, Kukuipahu was the ruler. Kukuipahu had the larger part of Kohala, while Niulii had the smaller portion. Because of this fact the two were constantly at war with each other, therefore Kapunohu journeyed and cast his lot with Niulii, so as to have a chance to meet and kill Kukuipahu who had insulted him."

He went down the Opuowao gulch, which is next to Makapala and climbed the next rise, called Kohepalapala, next to Niulii and then down a little hollow called Kaha. When Kapunohu arrived at this place he saw the daughters of Niulii bathing. The first was named Neue and the younger one was called Keawehala. Kapunohu looked at the two girls and they looked at him. Kapunohu was a handsome man and his whole body was without blemish. So the girls, too, were beautiful to look upon."

Where are you from?” “I have come from the other end, from the ilima district.” “Yes, that is the truth. But when you say you are from these parts, that is not the truth. Where are you going to?” “I am going sight seeing along the way.” “Yes, and where are you to spend the night?” “At the place where sleep will overcome me; there I will sleep.” The girls then said: “And why not sleep here with our people?” “If you wish me to, I will.” “Yes, we wish it.” They then proceeded on to the house. When they arrived at the house they found Niulii and his wife Kawaikapu sitting by the doorway. Kawaikapu was also a very beautiful woman and very pleasant to look upon."

We were bathing when he came along, and being late we brought him home for the night and he can resume his journey tomorrow.” Niulii then said: “You should take him as your husband, you two women,” so Kapunohu took the two girls as his wives and made his home with the king, Niulii. A few days after this Niulii prepared for battle, and Kapunohu was made the general of all the forces of Niulii. The men were then sent to the front and the enemy was met with on their side of the Wainaia gulch at a place called Piauwai. Here the forces of Kukuipahu, commanded by a man named Kaluakanaka were met and the battle commenced. In this battle the forces under Kaluakanaka were beaten back by the forces of Kapunohu. The war was then carried over the Wainaia gulch and into Iole; then into Ainakea directly above Hinakahua at Kapaau, where Kukuipahu with the rest of his army was stationed. At this place the battle became very fierce and the spears went darting back and forth. It was at this place that Kapunohu threw his spear, Kanikawi (whereby the sugar-cane leaves rustled, the blades of grass grated, clouds of dust arose ), and by its force killed 3200 men and the slaughter was very great. Kapunohu took all the [ ] feather helmets and cloaks and Kukuipahu was killed together with a large number of his men; the rest of his army retreated to Lamakee in Kaauhuhu, where they were overtaken by Kapunohu and the battle was again resumed."

Puni ae la ka aina o Kohala ia Niulii, a oia wale no ke ’lii o Kohala puni ia wa.","In this battle Paopele, a great warrior, came out to meet Kapunohu; his war club, Keolewa by name, had six rounds on it. It was so long that when it was stood up its point would be wet with the mist in the heaven, and when laid down it would extend over the whole length of an ahupuaa from the sea to the mountain; when held up it would hide the sun and it could also hold back the east wind. It required 4000 men to carry it. When this man came out on the battle field at Lamakee fear entered the breast of Kapunohu, for the body of Paopele was very large and powerful; but his god Kanikaa said: “Don’t be afraid of the loud-voiced thunder in the heaven for it has no strength; you thrust him with your spear, Kanikawi, and I will bite him.” Soon after this instruction was given by Kanikaa, he bit the back of Paopele. While Paopele was considering the nature of this thing on his back, Kapunohu threw his spear at Paopele, which hit him squarely, passed through him and killed him instantly. Lamakee from that day to this became famous, for it was here that the great warrior Paopele was killed by Kapunohu. The remnant of the army of Kukuipahu was again routed and they retreated to Kaluawilinau, at Puuepa, and from there they retreated to Upolu, then Puakea, then on to Kamilo and up to the place where the old men planted their flags. Because of this fact the ahupuaa of Kukuipahu is one of the largest in the district of Kohala to this day. The whole of Kohala thus came under the charge of Niulii and he was acknowledged the king of the whole district."
"A pau ke kaua ana, holo mai la o Kapunohu, me ke ’kua ona o Kanikaa, a me kana laau palau o Kanikawi, i Oahu nei i kona kaikuahine, oia ka wahine a Olopana.

A o ko kaikoeke hoi o Olopana, aia no i ka mahiai me na kanaka.” I aku o Kapunohu: “E hele kaua e kuhikuhi oe ia’u i ka mala ai.” Hele aku la laua a hiki, kuhikuhi mai la ke kaikuahine, ewalu loi kalo nui, a hoi aku la ke kaikuahine.","After the battle, Kapunohu and his god Kanikaa set out for Oahu, taking his spear Kanikawi along with him, for a visit to his sister, the wife of Olopana. Kapunohu went aboard of a canoe at Kohala and landed at Keanapou, in Kahoolawe, where he spent the night; from this place he again set sail and landed at Kahalepalaoa in Lanai; then from this last place he set out and landed at Kaluakoi in Molokai; then from this place he again set out and landed at Makapuu Point, in Kailua, Koolau, where his sister Konahuanui was living. When she saw Kapunohu they wept together, after which she said: “We have no food ready. You must be hungry. There is food growing out there in the patches. Your brother-in-law, Olopana is out with the men, working.” Kapunohu said to the sister: “Let us go out so that you can show me the patches.” When they came to the place she pointed out eight patches of large taro and returned home."
"Noke aku la o Kapunohu i ka huhuki a pau na loi ai ewalu, ku ae la ke ahu o ka ai ma kapa, noke aku ana o Kapunohu i ka huhui a paa, hoo i ka ai i na lima, ma o a ma o, o ka aumaka iho la no ia o ke amo ana a hiki i ka hale, ua like me aha loi ai ma kela lima keia lima. A hiki o Kapunohu i ka hale me ka ai, nana mai la ke kaikuahine a olelo mai la: “Ka haha! Kupanaha oe! Kai no o ka huhuki ae nei kau hookahi loi, eia ka o ka huhuki no kau a pau loa.” I aku o Kapunohu: “Nui hoi paha ka ai, aole e kii liilii.” Lalau aku la o Kapunohu i kana ihe ia Kanikawi, a hahaki ae la i ka maka, [ ] a hoa iho la i ke ahi, a a ke ahi, lalau aku la i ke kalo a kolikoli, kiola aku la i loko o ke ahi, a mai la ke ahi, pela no kana hana mau ana, a lilo iho la ke kalo i wahie no ke ahi. Nolaila, ma keia hana ana a Kapunohu, ua kapaia “kalo paa o Waiahole,” he olelo kaulana loa ia mai Hawaii a Niihau.

Maopopo iho la ia Olopana ma kona lohe i ka olelo a kana kahuna, he kanaka koa ikaika loa o Kapunohu, he kanaka makau ole, he kanaka aa i mua o ka lehulehu. Nolaila, hoolilo aku la o Olopana ia Kapunohu i alihikaua nona, e hele e kaua me Kakuhihewa, ma keia kaua ana, ua make o Kakuhihewa ia Kapunohu, a lilo o Oahu nei a puni ia Olopana.","Kapunohu then set to work and pulled up all the taro in the eight patches, tied the taro into bundles and carried the whole lot in his two arms to the house, each arm holding the taro of four patches. When Kapunohu arrived at the house with the taro his sister looked on and said: “What an idea! I should think you would pull up but one patch, but here you have pulled up all the patches.” Kapunohu replied: “This will give us plenty of food; we will not be required to get it in small quantities.” Kapunohu [ ] then picked up his spear, Kanikawi, broke off the point and started the fire. When the fire lit, he took some of the taro and cut it up and threw the pieces into the fire and in this way used the taro for firewood. Because of this action of Kapunohu, the saying, “the hard taro of Waiahole,” is known from Hawaii to Niihau. When Olopana saw what Kapunohu had done, he began to scheme, that with the use of Kapunohu he would be able to conquer the whole of Oahu, as he and Kakuhihewa, the king of the Kona side of Oahu, were on bad terms. Through the advice of his priest, Olopana was made doubly sure that Kapunohu was a very strong and brave man and was fearless and willing to meet all comers. Therefore Olopana made Kapunohu the commander-in-chief of his forces and urged upon him to go and fight Kakuhihewa. In this battle Kakuhihewa was slain by Kapunohu and the whole of Oahu came under the rule of Olopana."
"A make o Olopana, haalele iho la o Kapunohu ia Oahu nei, holo aku la ia ma ka waa a pae ma Poki i Waimea, Kauai, hele aku la ia malaila aku, a hiki i Wahiawa, malaila aku a Lawai i Koloa noho.

No ka mea, e noho ana o Kemamo ma waena o Koloa a me Nawiliwili, me kana wahine o Waialeale.","After the death of Olopana, Kapunohu left Oahu and journeyed to Kauai. Boarding his canoe he set sail and first landed at Poki, in Waimea; from this place he continued on to Wahiawa and then on to Lawai in Koloa where he settled down. There lived at this place a great warrior, by the name of Kemamo, who was noted for his great strength and skill in the use of the sling; he was without equal in its practice; his left hand was considered better than his right, and he could throw a stone for a distance of six miles and in the seventh mile its force ceased. No person in Kauai was found who could face him, not from amongst the chiefs or soldiers. Because of this man people were afraid to travel between Koloa and Nawiliwili; those on the Koolau side could not pass over to Nawiliwili and those from the Kona side were afraid to travel toward the Koloa side, for the reason that Kemamo and his wife Waialeale lived between Koloa and Nawiliwili."
"A hiki o Kapunohu i laila, moe iho la ia a ao ae, i kau hale kamaaina, hoeu ae la o Kapunohu e hele, olelo mai kamaaina: “Mai hele oe, o make auanei oe i ke koa o makou nei.” Ninau aku o Kapunohu: “Owai ia koa?” “O Kemamo.” “Pehea kona ikaika?” “He maa ala kona ikaika, aole e hala ka ala ke lele mai, aole hoi e nawaliwali i na mile elima, nolaila mai hele oe, o make auanei.” I aku o Kapunohu: “Aole hoi ha he ikaika, he mea paani ka maa ala, na ko makou kamalii mai lewalewa, a he mea ikaika ole no.” No keia olelo a Kapunohu, kaulana aku la ia a lohe o Kemamo, i iho o Kemamo: “Ae, akahi mea nana i hoole kuu maa, oia, ina he manao kona e hele mai e hoike i na ikaika o maua, e hele mai no.” A lohe o Kapunohu, hele aku la ia a hiki, i mai la o Kemamo: “Ea! O oe ke kanaka nana i hoole kuu ala?” I aku o Kapunohu: “Ae, owau no, no ka olelo mai a lakou nei, he ikaika oe i ka maa i ka ala. Nolaila, olelo aku au, he mea paani ia na ko makou kamalii mai lewalewa.”","When Kapunohu arrived at Lawai he was entertained that night by some of the people of the place, and on the next day he prepared to continue on his journey. When he was ready to start, the people said: “You must not go by this way or you will get killed by our great warrior.” Kapunohu then asked: “Who is this warrior?” “Kemamo.” “In what is his strength?” “He is very skilful in the use of the sling. He never misses a shot, and the strength of his flying stone will go over five miles. Therefore you must not go for you will get killed.” Kapunohu said: “Then he is not strong. The sling is only a plaything for the boys of our place and it is not considered of any consequence.” These remarks made by Kapunohu were carried around until they reached Kemamo; so Kemamo made the remark: “Yes, this is the first time that my strength in the use of the sling has been denied. Well and good; if he desires to come and test as which of us is the stronger, let him come on.” When Kapunohu heard this, he went out to meet Kemamo. Upon seeing Kapunohu, Kemamo asked: “Are you the man that has said that I have no strength in the use of the sling?” Kapunohu replied: “Yes, I am the man. It is because these people said that you are very skilful in the use of the sling, so I said, that it is the plaything with the small boys at our place.”"
"A lohe o Kemamo, huhu iho la ia ia Kapunohu, a olelo mai la: “E! Heaha kau pili, e ka malihini?” I aku o Kapunohu: “ O na iwi ka’u pili.” Ae mai o Kemamo: “Ae, [ ] a heaha hou ae?” I aku keia: “O ka waiwai iho la no ia a kamahele o na iwi, ina wau e eo, alaila make au, a ina hoi oe e eo, make oe ia’u.” Ae mai la o Kemamo: “Ae ua mau ia pili ana.” Olelo aku o Kemamo: “O ka pahu a kaua, e ku ai a maa, mai Koloa a Moloaa i Koolau ka pahu ia ma waena o laila ka kaua hana, a i puka ma o o Moloaa eo kekahi o kaua.” Ae aku la o Kapunohu. I aku nae o Kapunohu: “O ka’u hana i ike o ka pahee, malaila no wau, o kau hana hoi i ike o ka maa, malaila no oe.” Ae mai la o Kemamo. I aku o Kemamo: “Ia wai mua, i kamaaina paha, i ka malihini paha?” I aku o Kemamo: “I kamaaina ka mua, he hope ka ka malihini.”","When Kemamo heard this he became very angry toward Kapunohu and said: “What will the stranger bet on the proposition?” Kapunohu replied: “My life will be [ ] my stake.” “Yes,” said Kemamo, “and what else?” Kapunohu replied: “That is all a traveler takes with him. If you beat me my life shall be forfeited, and if I should beat you your life shall be forfeited.” Kemamo agreed to this and the bet was declared made. Kemamo then said: “The course over which we shall compete in throwing the stone with the sling, shall be from Koloa to Moloaa in Koolau. We must make our throws over these points and toward Moloaa; whoever throws the greatest distance beyond Moloaa wins.” Kapunohu replied: “Yes, I will agree to that, but I am going to use my spear while you use your sling.” Kemamo agreed to this. Kemamo then asked: “Who shall take the first chance? Shall it be the stranger, or shall it be the native son?” Kapunohu answered: “Let the native son take the first chance and the stranger the last.”"
"Ia wa, maa o Kemamo a pau eono maila, a i ka hiku nawaliwali, pela ka nawe hele ana a hiki i Anahola waiho, ilaila loaa i ke kukini mama o Kauai, o Kawaikuauhoe kona inoa. Pahee o Kapunohu i kana ihe, holo aku la kana ihe mai Koloa aku a Niumalu, o ka malu o ka la i ka ihe a Kapunohu, kapaia ia aina o Niumalu a hiki i keia la.

A eo ae la o Kemamo hooko ia ka laua pili, a lilo ae la o Kapunohu i alii no Kauai.","Kemamo then took up his sling and threw his stone, which went six miles and over, and it only fell and rolled after it had entered into the seventh mile, stopping at Anahola, where it was picked up by the best runner of Kauai, a man by the name of Kawaikuauhoe. Kapunohu then threw his spear, darting along from Koloa and over Niumalu, and as it shielded the sun from the coconut trees at this place the land was given the name of Niumalu, as known to this day; then it went on and into the water in upper Wailua, giving the place the name of Kawelowai as well as the land next to it which is called Waiehu; from this place it again took an upward flight flying along till it pierced through a ridge at Anahola, which is called Kalaea , leaving a hole through it, which can be seen to this day; from this place it went on past Moloaa, then past Waiakalua, then into Kalihikai, where it grew weaker and finally stopped at Hanalei. Kemamo was therefore beaten and the conditions of their bet were carried out. Kapunohu became thereby king of Kauai. [ ]"
"O Wahiawa ka makuakane, o Kukaniloko ka makuahine, o Kaukaalii ka makuahine o Kukaniloko, o Halemano e pili la me Lihue ka aina, i Waianae.

Kaukaalii was the mother of Kukaniloko, and the land of Halemano, which is next to Lihue in Waianae, is the place where Halemano was born. Through the married life of Wahiawa and Kukaniloko, his wife, six children were born to them, four males and two females. The names of the children were as follows: Maeaea, the first, was a male; Kaiaka, the second, was also a male; Anahulu, the third, was another male; Halemano, the youngest of the children, was another male; Pulee was a female; Laenihi was a female with supernatural powers."
"O Laenihi ka mua, a o Halemano ka hope, oia ka mea nona keia kaao. I Kaaukahi i hanai ia ai o Halemano a nui, he kanaka maikai o Halemano ma kona kino, aohe puu, aohe kee, pali ke kua, mahina ke alo.","Laenihi was the eldest, and Halemano, the youngest [of the family], and the hero of this story. He was nurtured in Kaau until he grew up, and became a very handsome man, perfect in form, without pimples or deformity, with straight back and open countenance. While Halemano was living with his grandmother, Kaukaalii, at Kaau, in Waianae, he was subject to dreams."
"Ia Halemano e noho ana me kona kupunawahine me Kaukaalii, ma Kaau i Waianae, ua loaa ia Halemano ka moe uhane ma ia noho ana no Kamalalawalu.

The parents of Kamalalawalu were chiefs of the land of Kapoho. She was a very beautiful woman to behold, far superior to all the women of Puna and Hilo, a virgin, brought up under very strict kapu; no person was allowed to see her and she had no companion other than her own brother, Kumukahi. These two had eight hundred dogs for their companions."
"Ia wa e noho ana o Huaa he ’lii no Puna, a o Kulukulua no Hilo, o laua a elua, e hookuli ana ia Kamalalawalu, i ka waiwai o Puna a me Hilo, me ko laua manao, na laua e wahi ke kapu o Kamalalawalu.","At this time Huaa was the king of Puna, and Kulukulua was the king of Hilo. Both of these kings were courting Kamalalawalu, giving her large quantities of properties from Puna and Hilo, with the idea that in time one of them would win her hand and take her to wife."
"Ma ka moe mua a Halemano ma ka po akahi ua halawai uhane laua me Kamalalawalu ma Kaau, pela ko laua launa pinepine ana, a aloha o Halemano ia Kamalalawalu. No ke aloha o Halemano, ua waiho oia i ka ai a me ka ia, a ua pau kona manao i na mea [ ] e ae, o Kamalalawalu wale no kona manao nui i na la a pau loa; no keia manao pono ole ia ia, ua nawaliwali kona kino a make iho la.","In Halemano’s first dream, he dreamed that he met Kamalalawalu in Kaau. After that he met her in his dreams frequently, and this happened so often that he fell deeply in love with the object of his dreams. Because of this great love, Halemano refused to [ ] take food and meat, and he denied himself everything; his whole mind was centered on Kamalalawalu, both night and day. And because of this he became very ill and finally died."
"No Laenihi, oia ko Halemano mua ponoi, ua hele oia ma na wahi a pau o keia mau mokupuni a pau, e imi i wahine na Halemano, kona kaikunane. Ua hele no hoi oia a kokoke i Puna, lohe e oia i ka make o Halemano, hoi e ia i Kaau, ma Waianae, i Oahu nei; nolaila, loaa ole o Kamalalawalu ia ia. A hiki o Laenihi i Kaau, ma Waianae ma Oahu nei, he mana ko Laenihi e hoola i na mea make, nolaila, ola hou o Halemano.","Laenihi, who was the elder of Halemano, in the meantime was traveling from place to place in search of a wife for Halemano her brother. In her search she went until near Puna, when she was recalled upon hearing of the death of Halemano which forced her to return to Kaau in Waianae, Oahu. Because of this she failed to meet Kamalalawalu. When Laenihi arrived at Kaau, through her power to restore the dead to life, Halemano was again brought back to life."
"A ola o Halemano, ninau aku o Laenihi: “Heaha ke kumu o kou make ana?” I mai o Halemano: “He wahine. Eia ke ano ke hiki mai, he wahine maikai loa o na maka a me ke kino, he lauoho kalole eleele, he wahine kiekie hanohano, kohu alii, ke nana aku.” Ninau hou aku o Laenihi: “A pehea kona kahiko o waho?” “He aala ke kapa e like me ke pele o Kauai a me ka mahuna, a he pa-u nahenahe ulaula ma hope, he lei hala, me ka lehua ko ke poo, a me ko ka ai.” I aku o Laenihi: “No Puna a me Hilo ka lehua, no Puna ka ouholowai o Laa, nolaila no ka pukohukohu, no Puna ko wahine, aole no ke komohana a ka la. Ina o ka wahine i lohe wale ai i Puna, o Kamalalawalu, he wahine maikai io no,” pela aku o Laenihi ia Halemano. Ninau aku o Laenihi ia Halemano: “Ahea hiki ko wahine?” I mai o Halemano: “Aia a moe iho wau, o ka manawa ia e hui ai maua; e hoolohe no auanei oukou i ke kamailio a maua, ke moe ae au.” “Ae,” wahi a Laenihi. “I moe olua auanei me ko wahine, e ninau aku oe i ko wahine, i kona aina a me kona inoa.”","Shortly after Halemano was restored to life, Laenihi asked him: “What was the cause of your death?” Halemano replied: “It is because of a woman. This is the manner of her appearance [in my dreams]: she is very beautiful; her eyes and body are perfect; she has long, straight, black hair; is tall, dignified, and seems to be of very high rank like a chiefess.” Laenihi again asked him: “What is the nature of her outward dress?” “Her dress seems to be scented with pele and mahuna of Kauai, and her pa-u is made of some very light material dyed red. She wears a hala wreath and a lehua wreath on her head and around her neck.” Laenihi then said: “It is in Puna and Hilo that the lehua blossoms are found. It is in Puna that the ouholowai of Laa and the pukohukohu are found; therefore, your lover must be a woman of Puna; she is not of the west. If it is Kamalalawalu, the woman I heard so much of while in Puna, then she must be very beautiful indeed.” Laenihi then again asked: “How do you meet her?” Halemano replied: “When I fall asleep we meet very soon after, and you could hear us talk if you should listen; even now you could hear us if I fall asleep.” Laenihi then said: “Yes, you may go to sleep now. If you should meet your lover, ask her to give you her name and the name of the land in which she lives.”"
"A lohe o Halemano i na olelo a kona kaikuahine a Laenihi, mahope o laila, moe iho la laua me Kamalalawalu. Ma keia moe ana, ninau aku o Halemano ia Kamalalawalu: “Owai kou aina hanau, a owai kou inoa?” “O Kapoho i Puna, Hawaii, ko’u aina hanau, aia ma ka hikina a ka la ko’u aina, aole ma ke komohana; o ko’u inoa, o Kamalalawalu.” Mahope o laila, ala ae la o Halemano a olelo aku ia Laenihi, a lohe o Laenihi, olelo aku la ia ia Halemano: “E ai oe i ka ai, e kii au i ko wahine i Hawaii.” Ae mai o Halemano.","After Halemano had received these instructions he fell asleep and again met Kamalalawalu. In this dream Halemano asked Kamalalawalu: “What is the name of the land of your birth and what is your name?” “Kapoho in Puna, Hawaii, is the land of my birth; it is where the sun rises, and not in the west. My name is Kamalalawalu.” Shortly after this Halemano awoke from his sleep, and he told Laenihi of his dream. When Laenihi heard this she said: “You must partake of some food and I will go and bring you your lover from Hawaii.” Halemano then consented and took some food."
"Mamua ae o ka holo ana o Laenihi i Hawaii, e kii ia Kamalalawalu, olelo aku ia i na ouli o kona hele ana, a hope e hooiaio aku ai i kona kii ana. Malaila ka loaa a me ka ole o Kamalalawalu.

The signs were as follows: “If it rains, then I am at Molokai. If the lightning flashes, then I am at Maui. If it thunders, I am at Kohala. If you feel an earthquake, I am at Hamakua. If the red water flows, I am at Puna. If the signs show that I am at Puna, then you can be sure that I will be able to get your lover. You must consider these things I am telling [ ] you, else you will forget.” Soon after this Laenihi went off in the form of a fish; and the fish that is called laenihi is named after her. This is the name of this fish to this day."
"Holo mai la o Laenihi i ke ahiahi, a hiki i Haleolono ma Palaau i Molokai, ua ka ua. Kahaha o hope no ka hikiwawe loa. Malaila aku a Hanakaieie, ma Kahikinui i Honuaula, ma Maui, olapa ka uwila.

Alaila, noonoo o hope nei, ua loaa o Kamalalawalu.","It was in the evening that Laenihi set out and when she was off the coast of Haleolono in Palaau, Molokai, it began to rain [in Oahu]. Those with whom she had left the instructions were surprised at the speed she was traveling. From this place she next passed off Hanakaieie at Kahikinui in Honuaula, Maui, and the lightning flashed. The people were again greatly amazed at her great speed. From Maui she next passed off Umiwai in Kohala, Hawaii, when the people heard the roar of the thunder; then when she was off the coast of Pololikamanu outside of Mahiki, Hamakua, the people felt an earthquake. Next she passed Hilo and then off the coast of Panaewa, then off Kukulu, directly outside of Puna, when the red water flowed. At sight of this the last sign the people knew that Laenihi had reached Kamalalawalu."
"Ma keia hiki ana o Laenihi i Kapoho ma Puna i Hawaii, noonoo iho la ia i ka mea e ike ai ia Kamalalawalu, i loko o kona kapu e paa ana, a loaa iho la.

At last Laenihi hit upon a plan. She, through her power, first caused the wind from the sea to blow, called the unuloa , which caused the sea to be aroused from its calm repose and the surf off Kaimu began to roll in. It is here that the people at all times go in surf riding. Early that morning the surf began to roll in. When the people rose from their sleep and saw the surf, they all began to shout and yell. While the people were shouting, Kumukahi, the brother of Kamalalawalu heard it and he came out to see the cause, and saw that it was the surf; so he returned and told Kamalalawalu of the matter. On hearing this she rose and prepared to go out [surf riding]."
"Olelo hoakaka no Kumukahi; ke kaikunane o Kamalalawalu. He punahele o Kumukahi i kona kaikuahine, aohe ana olelo hookahi e hoole ia, e hiki i kona kaikuahine ke ae i na mea a pau a kona kaikunane e olelo ai, aole e hoole, mai ka mea nui a ka mea liilii.","A few words in relation to Kumukahi the brother of Kamalalawalu. Kumukahi was a great favorite with his sister, not a single request would be refused by his sister that she could comply with, from the greatest to the smallest."
"Hele aku la o Kamalalawalu e heenalu ma Kaimu; ia ia i hiki aku ai ma ka ae one, nana aku la ia i ka nalu i ka hai mai. Ku ka nalu mua, he kakala ka nalu mua, a hai ia, he pakaiea ka nalu alua, a hala ia, he opuu ka nalu akolu, a hala na nalu ekolu, au aku la o Kamalalawalu, e heenalu. A hiki i kahi o ka nalu e hai ana, hee mai la ia, ekolu nalu i hala ma kana hee ana, pio loa iho la ka nalu, aohe nalu o ia wa; kakali iho la ia, me ka manao e ku hou mai ua nalu hou, pela kona lana ana a opili ia, manao iho la e hoi i uka.","When Kamalalawalu saw the surf rolling in at Kaimu she started out for the beach. Upon arriving at the place she stood on the sand and watched for a chance to swim out. She allowed the first roller, known as the kakala , to come in until it reached the shore; then the second, known as the pakaiea ; then the third, the opuu ; as soon as this roller reached the shore, she plunged in and swam out to the place where the rollers began to curve up. When she arrived at this place she took the first roller that came along and rode in on it. This she repeated three times, when the surf began to grow smaller till after a short while there was none to be seen. She then waited with the hope of again seeing the surf grow larger; but after waiting until she was almost stiff with the cold not a single surf could be seen; so she concluded to return to the shore."
"Ia wa hoala hou o Laenihi i ka nalu, a ike o Kamalalawalu, hee hou iho la ia, a kokoke e pae i uka, lilo iho la ka nalu ana i hee ai i ia, pau ae la ka nalu. O keia ia, o Laenihi no ia, ua lilo iho la ia, i ia, ia wa. A ike o Kumukahi ke kaikunane aloha a Kamalalawalu i ka ia, kahea aku la ia, penei: “E Kamalalawalu e! kuu puni o ka ia . ” [ ] Aole e hiki ia Kamalalawalu ke hoole, no ka mea, he leo no kona kaikunane. Lalau iho la i ka ia a hoi aku la i ka hale, hoo iho la i loko o ka ipu wai a lilo ae la ia i milimili na kona kaikunane.","At about this time, Laenihi caused the surf to rise again and it began to roll in. When Kamalalawalu saw this she again returned and took the first surf and rode in, but before she reached the shore it ceased and the surf again disappeared. Just as she reached the shallow water she saw a fish and Kumukahi at the same time called out to her: “Kamalalawalu, take up my favorite, the fish.” This fish was Laenihi herself. Kamalalawalu [ ] could not refuse the request of her brother; so she took up the fish and returned home. After arriving at the house the fish was put into a calabash of salt water and it became a plaything for Kumukahi."
"I ka po, i ka moe ana o loko o ka hale, lilo ae la o Laenihi mai ke kino ia, a ke kino moa, ia wa lele ae la a ma ka haka moa o waho kani, pela kona kani ana, a pau na moa elima.

Pii mai la o Laenihi me ke kino wahine a hiki i ka hale o Kamalalawalu ma e noho ana. Ninau aku o Kamalalawalu: “Mahea mai oe?” “Maanei mai nei.” “Aohe o onei wahine e like me oe, a ina no hoi no anei aku nei, aole no e hele mai ianei, he kapu o anei, he make.” Wahi a Laenihi: “Makai mai nei.” “Ae, ina pela kau olelo, he oiaio, e ae aku wau.” Ninau hoohuahualau aku o Laenihi: “Aole au kane i moe i ka uhane?” “Aole,” wahi a Kamalalawalu. I hou aku o Laenihi: “Aole ou lei i lei ai a maloo?” “He lei no, aole nae e loaa aku ia oe, mamuli au make ia oe.” I mai o Laenihi: “Heaha la hoi e haawi mai oe ia’u, a i mai oe, kii ae no ia’u e hele mai e lapaau ia oe, aia ko’u wahi i Kaimu, o Nawahinemakaakai ko’u inoa.” Lilo ka lei ia Laenihi, nonoi hou o Laenihi i ka pa-u, haawi no o Kamalalawalu, alua mea i lilo ia Laenihi.","That night after everybody had fallen asleep, Laenihi transformed herself from a fish into a rooster; it then flew onto the roosting place outside and began to crow. The crowing was kept up until the dawn began to break. The rooster then proceeded down to the seashore where it transformed itself into a woman. Laenihi then returned to the house where Kamalalawalu was living. When she arrived at the house Kamalalawalu asked her: “Where are you from?” “I am from near here.” “There is no woman like you near here, and even if you belonged to any place near, you would not come, because they all know that people are forbidden from coming here on pain of death.” Laenihi then said: “I come from shoreward.” “If that is so you are telling me the truth.” Laenihi then proceeded to speak of her errand: “Have you ever met a man in your dreams?” “No,” said Kamalalawalu. Laenihi again asked: “Have you no wreath that you have worn until withered?” “I have a wreath, but I am not going to give it to you, for you may cause my death with it.” Laenihi replied: “All right, you give it to me and in case you should become ill, come for me and I will come and cure you. I am living at Kaimu; my name is Nawahinemakaakai.” Laenihi took the wreath and then asked for the pa-u of Kamalalawalu which was also given up."
"A loaa keia mau mea ia Laenihi, hoi mai la ia mai Hawaii mai a hiki i Waialua, a kahi o Halemano e noho ana, hoike aku la o Laenihi i ka lei, a me ka pa-u, ia wa, wikiwiki iho la o Halemano e holo i Hawaii, hoole mai o Laenihi: “Aole e loaa pela. Eia ka mea e loaa ai, e hana i milimili na ke kaikunane punahele o Kamalalawalu, o Kumukahi ka inoa, no ka mea, ua ike aku nei au, o kana mea e olelo ai, oia ka kona kaikuahine e hana ai, aole ia e hoole i na leo a pau a kona kaikunane e pane ai.”","After Laenihi had received these things she returned from Hawaii to Waialua and from there on to where Halemano was living. Laenihi then showed him the wreath and the pa-u. Upon seeing these things Halemano hastily prepared himself to go to Hawaii; but Laenihi rebuked him, saying: “You will not be able to get her in that way. Here is the way to get her: You must first make some playthings for the favorite brother of Kamalalawalu, Kumukahi by name; because I have seen that whatever things he desires his sister would always do; she will deny nothing that her brother requests of her.”"
"Nolaila, olelo o Laenihi, e kalai kii, mai Waialua a Waianae, e paele i ka alaea a me ka nanahu, a e hana i moa laau, hooholoholo i luna o ka nalu, a i koieie i luna o ka wai, a i lupe hoolele i luna.

Orders were also issued that wooden chickens be made to ride on the surf, also koieie floaters, and kites to fly above; also that a red canoe be prepared and red men be had to paddle the canoe. The men should be provided with red paddles and the canoe must be rigged with red cords, and that a large and a small canoe be provided. After these different things were ready they set out for Puna, Hawaii. Upon their arrival off of Makuu and Popoki, two small pieces of lands next to Puna, the kite was put up. When the people on the shore saw this flying object they all shouted with joy."
"Ia lakou e uwa ana, lohe aku la o Kumukahi, ke kaikunane o Kamalalawalu, hele mai la ia e nana, a ike ia, holo mai la a ka ae one e pili ana me ke kai, kahea mai la i na kanaka o luna o ka waa: “Na’u ka mea lele.” I aku o Laenihi ia Halemano: “Haawi ia aku na ke keiki.” A lilo ka lupe ia Kumukahi.

When he saw the kite he ran to the beach and called out to the men in the canoe: “Let me have the thing that flies.” Laenihi said to Halemano: “Let the boy have the kite,” and it was then given to Kumukahi. [ ] The small canoe was then let down and as it floated through the surf the people ashore again shouted with joy. Kumukahi turned back and called out to those in the canoe, saying: “Let me have that small canoe.” Laenihi gave her consent. He then requested all the things exhibited by the people until the idols were the only things left. Laenihi then ordered that the idols be made to stand up in all the canoes. When Kumukahi saw the idols he asked that they all be given to him."
"Olelo aku o Halemano a me Laenihi: “He punahele no oe i ko kaikauhine?” “Ae,” pela mai o Kumukahi; “ma ka’u e olelo ai, malaila ia.” “Kahea ia hoi ha.” Kahea o Kumukahi: “E Kamalalawalu e! Hele mai, aia ka a hele mai oe, alaila, loaa kuu milimili.” A hiki o Kamalalawalu, olelo hou lakou la: “He punahele no auanei oe i ko kaikuahine, ke olelo aku oe e huli aku ke alo mahope, a o ke kua mamua nei?” “Ae.” A huli kua aku la o Kamalalawalu, nana aku lakou ma ke kua, aohe puu, aohe kee. A pau ko lakou nana ana, olelo hou lakou i ke kaikunane. “He punahele no oe i ko kaikuahine ke olelo aku e huli mai ke alo i mua nei?” “Ae,” a huli mai la ke alo o Kamalalawalu.","At this Laenihi and Halemano said: “Are you a favorite with your sister?” “Yes,” answered Kumukahi, “she will do anything I ask of her.” “Call for her then.” Kumukahi then called out: “Kamalalawalu, come here. I cannot get these playthings unless you come.” Upon the arrival of Kamalalawalu another request was made of Kumukahi: “Are you a favorite with your sister, and would she mind if you asked her to turn her back this way?” “Yes.” Kamalalawalu then turned her back toward the canoes. The people then looked at her and saw that she was neither humped back nor deformed in any way. After inspecting her they said to the brother: “Are you a favorite with your sister, and would she obey you if you request of her to turn her face this way?” “Yes.” Kamalalawalu then faced toward the canoes."
"Ia wa, pii o Kamalalawalu i luna o na waa; a hiki ia i luna, kahea o Halemano i ka poe hoewaa e hoe, ia wa lilo laua elua i Oahu nei. Hahai mai la o Puna a me Hilo, aohe launa mai, hao mai la ka mana o na waa o Halemano a me Laenihi.","Soon after this Kamalalawalu went aboard one of the canoes; whereupon Halemano gave orders to the paddlers that they start on their return, and the two were thus carried off to Oahu. The people of Puna and Hilo pursued them but could not come near them, as by the power of Halemano and Laenihi they were soon left far to the rear."
"Ma keia holo ana, pae ae la kekahi waa me Kumukahi i Hauula ma Koolauloa. Ilaila kekahi kii e ku ana, o Malaekahana ka inoa, hoohihi iho la o Kumukahi i ke kii, noho iho la i laila.

Ma keia pae ana, ua holo koke ka luna kala a puni o Waialua a me Waianae, e hele mai laua e hookupu ia Kamalalawalu.","In this flight to Oahu, one canoe, the one in which was Kumukahi, landed at Hauula, Koolauloa. There was at this place an image standing, Malaekahana by name; upon seeing this image, Kumukahi took such a fancy to it that he remained there. Halemano and the others, together with Kamalalawalu, continued on their way and landed at Ukoa at Waialua. As soon as the canoe in which Kamalalawalu was a passenger landed, a crier was sent out to make a circuit of Waialua and Waianae with orders to the people to come and give presents to Kamalalawalu."
"A pau ka hookupu ana, ekolu la i hala, haohao o Kamalalawalu ia Kumukahi i ka ike ole ia aku. Ninau aku la ia ia Halemano a me Laenihi: “Auhea o Kumukahi?” “Aia i Hauula, ua noho ia puni ana o ke kii.” I aku o Kamalalawalu: “E kii aku a hoi mai.” A hoi mai la o Kumukahi, olelo aku la o Kamalalawalu: “E hoi oe me ka waiwai i Hawaii, i na makua o kaua a me na makaainana, o poino mai kekahi o lakou.” Ia wa, hoi aku la o Kumukahi i Hawaii. [ ]","About three days after the hookupu , Kamalalawalu for the first time missed Kumukahi, so she asked of Halemano and Laenihi: “Where is Kumukahi?” “He is at Hauula where he is enraptured by an image that is there.” Kamalalawalu then said: “Go and bring him here.” When Kumukahi arrived, Kamalalawalu said to him: “You had better return to Hawaii with the presents to our parents and to our people, else some of them will feel troubled over us.” Kumukahi in obedience to his sister returned to Hawaii. [ ]"
"A noho iho la o Kamalalawalu me Halemano, ia wa ua kaulana aku ka maikai o Kamalalawalu a lohe o Aikanaka, ke ’lii nui o Oahu nei, e noho ana ma Ulukou i Waikiki. Hoouna aku la o Aikanaka, i na elele e kii ia Kamalalawalu e iho mai e nana aku o Aikanaka i kona wahine maikai, a hiki na elele, hoole mai o Kamalalawalu.

Nolaila, huhu o Aikanaka a hoouna i ke kaua e pepehi ia Halemano a me na makua.","Kamalalawalu lived with Halemano as husband and wife, and the fame of the beauty of Kamalalawalu was soon spread all over Oahu until it came to the ears of Aikanaka, the king of Oahu, who was living at Ulukou in Waikiki. Upon hearing this, Aikanaka sent messengers to go and bring Kamalalawalu to him in order that he may see her for himself. When the messengers arrived [and presented the king’s request], Kamalalawalu refused to obey. On the return of the messengers to Aikanaka without Kamalalawalu, other messengers were sent but she still refused. This was kept up until ten delegations had been sent and Kamalalawalu as often had refused to come. The premier was then sent, but he too returned without any better success. Finally Aikanaka got so angry that he declared war against Halemano and his parents."
"A hiki ke kaua a Aikanaka i Pooamoho ma Halemano, ike mua aku la o Halemano i ka uluwehiwehi o na kanaka i laila, e panee aku ana, i ke kakahiaka nui. Olelo aku ia i ka wahine: “Eia ke kaua a Aikanaka, make kakou. O ka’u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe, e ka wahine, e iho oe i ka hoouna a ke ’lii, hoole oe. A laa ka make la. E hele no olua i ka olua hele, e hele no au i ka’u hele.”","When the army of Aikanaka arrived at Pooamoho in Halemano, Halemano saw it coming early in the morning; so he said to his wife: “Here comes the army of Aikanaka. We are going to be killed. I told you to go in obedience to the king’s command, but you would not listen to me. Now death is sure to come. You two go your way and I will go mine. ”"
"Hele aku la o Halemano ma, malaila aku a ke kahawai o Kolekole, malaila aku a Waialua, a Laiewai, a Hauula, malaila aku a Kualoa, a Kahaluu, a hiki i Moelana, he mala awa i laila, haihai iho la o Kaaealii ke kupunawahine o Halemano, i ka lau awa, a pee iho la.","Soon after this Halemano and his wife together with the grandmother left their home and traveled to the Kolekole stream; from this place they proceeded to Waialua; then to Laiewai; then to Hauula and from there on to Kualoa, Kahaluu and Moelana. At this place there was a large awa field growing; Kaaealii, the grandmother of Halemano, then broke some of the awa leaves and hid themselves under them."
"Eia hoi, ua kauoha o Aikanaka i na mea a pau loa a puni Oahu nei, ina e ike ia Halemano, e pepehi a make, nolaila, akoakoa ae la na kanaka o Koolau a puni, a imi iho la i loko o ka mala awa ma Moelana, aole nae he loaa, no ka mea, ua nalo lakou nei ekolu malalo o ka lau awa i haihai ia ai, e Kaaealii.","In the meantime Aikanaka had issued an order over the whole of Oahu, that Halemano should be killed on sight. The people of all Koolau therefore gathered and made a search, even to the awa field at Moelana; but they could not be found, though they looked for them everywhere, for the leaves picked by Kaaealii concealed all three of them."
"A hoi aku la na kanaka, noho iho la lakou nei a poeleele, hele aku la a hiki ma Kukui i Makapuu, o ia mai. He makamaka no Halemano i laila, kipa aku la lakou i laila, kalua ka puaa, a moa, ai a maona.

Here they went in and made themselves known; a pig was then killed for them and they partook of a hearty meal, after which Halemano said to the people of the place: “Will some of you take us to Molokai?” At midnight they boarded a canoe and set out, landing at Kaunakakai in Molokai. Here they remained for some time farming, and when their crops were almost ripe they set out for Lele, Maui, where they sojourned for a time. While living in Lele, they saw the top of Haleakala as though [ ] floating above the clouds; Halemano became so enraptured at sight of the top of the mountain that he wished to move to Haleakala and live in Kaupo, Maui."
"Mahope o laila, holo aku lakou mai Molokai aku a pae ma Lele i Maui. Hele aku la lakou mai laila aku a hiki i Kula, ma laila aku a Ulupalakua, a iho ma o, a Kaupo, noho i laila, mahiai iho la, a kokoke e oo ka ai, holo aku la lakou a pae ma Umiwai i Kohala, Hawaii.","After that they returned to Molokai and again set out for Maui, landing at Lele, this time to make their residence in Kaupo. From Lele they journeyed to Kula, then to Ulupalakua, and from there on down to Kaupo, where they had decided to live. After tilling the soil and planting their crops they remained here until the crops were almost ripe, when they set out and sailed for Hawaii, landing in Umiwai, in Kohala."
"A ku lakou ma Umiwai, i Kohala, noho a olulo iho la malaila.

Kapuaokeonaona, the daughter of Kukuipahu the king of Kohala, then found them, and when she saw how handsome Halemano looked and how beautiful Kamalalawalu was, she invited them to come and live with her. When they arrived at the house a pig was killed and food was prepared for them. Here they lived for about six months. At the end of this time Halemano said to Kamalalawalu: “Let us leave our grandmother here while you and I go on to your place.” His wife consented to this."
"Hele aku la laua mai Kohala aku a hiki i Waimea, moe a ao, mai laila aku a Hamakua i Kaumoali moe; mai laila aku a hiki i Uluomalama, i Waiakea, Hilohanakahi noho.

Ae kona kaikunane.","They went from Kohala to Waimea where they spent the night; from this place they continued to Hamakua and spent the night at Kaumoali; from this place they proceeded on to Uluomalama in Waiakea, Hilohanakahi, where they stayed . After living in this place for twenty days, Huaa the king of Puna, heard that Kamalalawalu was in Hilo, so he sent a messenger to Kamalalawalu and she was taken to the king of Puna. When she was being taken by the messenger of Huaa, she instructed her brother Kumukahi to take good care of Halemano, which he promised to do."
"Ma keia noho ana a Halemano, ewalu anahulu i hala, o ka noho pu ana o laua me ke kaikoeke me Kumukahi, aohe launa mai o ka wahine, nolaila, kupu ka manao ia Halemano e hoi i Kohala nei.

While on his way back [to Kohala], as he passed through the shrubbery at Keakui he saw the maile as it grew on the ohia trees, so he sat down to make himself a maile wreath. As he was thus busily stripping, Kamalalawalu stood behind him and took hold of one corner of Halemano’s mantle while tears welled up in her eyes. Halemano then turned around and saw it was his wife, at which he wept and said: “You, my wife, of the parched plains of Kumanomano and of the waterless wastes of Lihue! How strange of you! I thought that when I came with you [to your home] that you would be true to me; but I see you are not.”"
"A pau ko laua uwe ana, hele aku laua a hiki i Uluomalama, ma Waiakea, noho iho la laua a hala elua anahulu i laila.

[ ]","After their weeping, they again took up their journey and continued as far as Uluomalama at Waiakea, where they stayed for twenty days. Then from this place they continued on to Kukuipahu in Kohala, where they made their residence and took up farming. The place where Halemano did his farming is at Ihuanu, the height looking down on Kauhola point and the surf of Maliu. This field where Halemano cultivated is famous to this day, for it is said that the covering of Ihuanu was palaholo and the watchman of the field was Kekuaualo. [ ]"
"Ia laua i noho ai i laila, hai mai la ka nalu o Kauhola, o ia kela inoa kaulana loa, o Maliu, kahi a na ’lii e heenalu ai, a pela no i na la o Kamehameha akahi.

When Kamalalawalu saw the surf she got up and went down to the beach. At sight of her the people were amazed at her great beauty and admired her. Shortly after this Kumoho came down to ride the surf, but before he went in he saw Kamalalawalu; so he sat down and also admired her beauty. After a while he sent his sister to go and bring Kamalalawalu to him, for he wished her to become his wife. Upon being requested to come to Kumoho, Kamalalawalu rose and came and she was then taken by Kumoho as his wife, and they lived below at Halelua."
"Ma keia lilo ana o Kamalalawalu i ke kane hou, e noho ana o Halemano me ka mai, a e noho ana hoi me ke kaumaha i ke aloha o ka wahine no ka lilo i ke kane hou.

Halemano therefore wasted away, for he refused to take any food and in a few days died."
"Ma keia make ana o Halemano, hoohiki iho la ke kupunawahine o Kaaealii: “Ae, i ola hou oe e Halemano, aole oe e hoi hou ana me Kamalalawalu, a pau ko’u ola.”","After this death of Halemano his grandmother made an oath that: “If you should ever come to life again, Halemano, you shall never go back to Kamalalawalu, as long as I live.”"
"Ua maopopo maloko o keia kaao ana, o Laenihi ke kaikuahine akua o Halemano, a oia no ka mea i ola ai o Halemano i ka make mua ana, a pela no ma keia make ana. O na makua, a me na kaikuaana kaikuahine o Halemano, ua mahuka aku lakou mai Oahu aku nei a noho i Wailua ma Kauai. O Laenihi kekahi ma keia hele ana i Kauai. O Laenihi, a me kona mua o Pulee noho iho la laua i Wailua a lealea i ka heenalu, hele aku la laua i ka heenalu i Makaiwa, e kupono ana i ka lulu o Kewa.","In the early part of this story we saw that it was Laenihi, the supernatural sister of Halemano that saved him, and so when he died this time she came and again brought him back to life. [While Aikanaka and his army were marching toward Lihue for the purpose of destroying Halemano], the parents of Halemano as well as the older brothers and sisters of Halemano all escaped from Oahu and went to Wailua, Kauai, to live. Laenihi also went along with the others to Kauai. Laenihi and her older sister Pulee stayed at Wailua, for they were very fond of surf riding. In their daily life in Wailua they often went in at Makaiwa to ride the surf; this place was directly on the lee side of Kewa."
"Lele ae la ka hauli o Laenihi, i nana ae ka hana i luna, e noho ana ka uhane o Halemano i ke aouli; haule iho la kona waimaka i lalo e kahe ana, no ke aloha i kona kaikunane ia Halemano; i aku o Laenihi ia Pulee: “Ua make o Halemano.”","One day while she was surf riding she had a premonition of some disaster. When she looked up she saw the spirit of Halemano sitting in the blue sky. Upon seeing this she wept, for she greatly loved her brother Halemano. She then turned to Pulee and said: “Halemano is dead.”"
"A lohe na makua, me na hoahanau i ka make o Halemano, lele mai la uwe; papa aku o Laenihi: “Alia oukou e uwe; e aho owau mua e kanaenae ae ai, a i aloha ia mai, ola o Halemano; aka, i lokoino lakou la, make no o Halemano, nolaila, e nana oukou, a e noonoo pono; mai pupuahulu oukou.” [ ]","When the parents, brothers and sisters heard of the death of Halemano, they all wailed, but Laenihi stopped them saying: “You must not weep now. Let me first pray to the gods, and if the gods take compassion on us Halemano will come to life again; but in case they are unmerciful, Halemano is indeed dead; you must therefore look on calmly and patiently.” [ ]"
"E noho ana no wau e uwe i kuu kaikunane, Kuu kaikunane o ka wao nahelehele, Oia paha ka uhane i ka waokele e, Ke noho mai la i ka maka o ka opua. Nalowale i ke aouli la e kuu hoike, Auwe no hoi kuu makamaka! Kuu hoikeike o na kai ewalu. Eia au la, o kou hoa, e ola—e, Aina ka ai, hume ia ka malo, ua ola.","I am indeed sitting and weeping for my brother, My brother of the thick groves. Perchance it is your spirit that is in death’s shade, Sitting there in the eyes of those pointed clouds. Hidden by the blue skies is my guide. Alas, I weep for you my beloved one! Thou art my guide of the eight seas. Here am I, your companion. Come back to life, Eat of the food, gird on your loin cloth, for you are restored."
"Ma keia oli ana a Laenihi, ola hou o Halemano i Kohala, Hawaii, a pau ke oli ana a Laenihi, lele mai la ia i loko o ke kai a au mai la (oia hoi ma kona kino ia, o ia kela ia o ka laenihi a hiki keia la). Ma keia au ana, he manawa ole, pae o Laenihi ma Kauhola i Kohala, pii aku la ia a hiki i ka hale o Halemano, uwe iho la a pau, noho iho la lakou a hala ke anahulu hookahi.","In this prayer recited by Laenihi, life was restored to the body of Halemano in Kohala, Hawaii. At the close of the prayer Laenihi plunged into the sea and swam, in her fish form as it is to this day. It did not take her very long to swim to Kohala, for in a very short time she went ashore at Kauhola and from there started for the home of Halemano. When she arrived she fell on her brother and wept; she remained with him for ten days."
"I mai o Halemano ia Kaaealii a me Laenihi: “E ao ana au i ka lawaia, a me ka mahiai i hoi kuu wahine.” Hoole aku o Kaaealii: “Aole e hoi ko wahine ia mau hana.” Pela no ka Halemano olelo a hiki i ka hula, ae mai o Kaaealii a me Laenihi: “O ia ka mea e hoi ai ko wahine, o ka hula.” Ia wa oli o Kaaealii i ka inoa o Halemano, penei:","One day Halemano said to Kaaealii and Laenihi: “I am going to learn how to be a fisherman and how to be a farmer, so that my wife will come back to me.” Kaaealii then said to him: “Your wife will never come back to you if you take up those arts.” Halemano then spoke of some other arts and still he was advised not to take them up as means of getting his wife back; finally he chose the art of singing and chanting. At this Laenihi and Kaaealii said: “That will be the art that will restore your wife to you.” Kaaealii then chanted the name of Halemano, which is as follows:"
"O oe ka ia e na wahine noho kai o ka pueone E noho ana i ke kaha Ulalana, E nana ana i ka mea maikai o uka, O ka ua a me ka makani anu, Kipu iho la i ke oho o ka lauki, Noho nani na lehua i ka lai o Kioi e! Aole ka oiaio i loko o ka moe e! I ka i mai ua lohe au e. O kaua no ia, mai o a anei e! O kou inoa ia e Halemano la e! O mai hoi e! E o e. E o no. [ ]","Thou art indeed the women dwellers of the surf line, Sitting on the sunny shore of Ulalana, Looking at the good things of the upper lands, The rain and the cold wind As they fold tightly the covering of ti-leaf. The lovers dwell in the calm of Kioi, For there is no truth in dreams When it confesses what it has heard. For we two have been here and there, For it is your name, Halemano. Answer the call; yes, answer it. [ ]"
"Ao iho la o Halemano i ka hula ia wa, o Laamaikahiki ke kumu hula, a pau ke ao ana, lolo iho la i ka puaa, a pau na hana a ke kumu ia Halemano, mahope o laila, kaulana aku la ka lea o Halemano i ka hula, a me ke oli, a puni o Kohala.","Halemano then began the study of the art of singing and chanting, taking Laamaikahiki as his teacher. After he concluded his education, the usual ceremonies, such as the killing of the pig, was gone through and he was duly declared passed as an expert. Shortly after this the fame of Halemano as a singer and a chanter was carried all around Kohala."
"Ia Halemano e oli ana, nana aku la ia, i ka piko o Haleakala i Maui, i ka oiliili ae i loko o ke ao, me he opua ala o ke ahiahi, ka lele mai o ke ao maluna, aloha ae la ia i kahi e hele ai me ka wahine, o Kamalalawalu. Nolaila, kau aku la ia i keia kau ma ke oli penei:","While Halemano was chanting one day, he looked up and saw the top of Haleakala in Maui as it appeared amongst the clouds, like a pointed cloud in the evening, as the other clouds drifted above it. This made him think of the places where he and his wife, Kamalalawalu, had traveled. He was then moved to chant the following lines:"
"Kaupo, aina pali huki i luna, Huki ae la e like me Kahikinui; He nui no wau nau e ke aloha, Kuu hoa mai ka malu o ka laau. Ola kaua i ka ai lauoho loloa o ka nahele. Auwe! Kuu wahine e! Kuu wahine mai ka makani he Kaumuku, Ke haki nuanua mai la i ka moana, Ke uhi ae la i na ale o Papawai, Na ka waa kaua i halihali mai, Auwe kuu wahine e! Kuu wahine o ka hale makamaka ole, Hookahi makamaka o ko aloha, Lou, a nanahu i loko o ka iwi hilo e! E ke aloha, ho mai he leo.","Kaupo, the land where one is pulled up, Pulled up like unto Kahikinui. I was once thought a good deal of, O my love! My companion of the shady trees. For we two once lived on the food from the long speared grass of the wilderness. Alas, O my love! My love from the [land of the] Kaumuku wind, As it comes gliding over the ocean, As it covers the waves of Papawai, For it was the canoe that brought us here. Alas, O my love! My love of the home where we were friendless, Our only friend being our love for one another. It is hooked and it bites to the very inside of the bones. O my love, speak to me!"
"Ia Halemano e oli ana, hiki mai la o Kamalalawalu, a nana mai la ia Halemano, ia wa, ikaika kona mano e hoi me Halemano, no ka nana aku ia Halemano, ua hele a ai ka manu i luna, a he lea i ke oli, a he kanaka maikai, no ka mea, e kaukaunu liilii ana o Halemano me Kikekaala, ke kaikamahine a Nunulu, oia kekahi alii ai okana o Kohala i loko o ia kau, malalo o Wahilani ke ’lii nui o Kohala.","While Halemano was chanting, Kamalalawalu arrived and she looked in at Halemano. When she saw him, she once more longed to return to him, for he looked very handsome and his chanting was something fine. Halemano too was at this time courting Kikekaala, the daughter of Nunulu. He was one of the high chiefs of the district of Kohala, under Wahilani, who was the king of this portion of Kohala."
"Mahope o keia, hoolaha aku la o Kikekaala i kana olelo kuahaua i ko Kohala a puni, i hele mai na mea a pau loa i ke kilu, oia kela papai kilu kaulana a hiki i keia la o Kohala, o Lolehale, ka inoa, aia maluna o ka puu e nana ala i ke komohana, e pili la me Puuonale, a me Hookukekii.

Ina kaua i kilu a i eo oe ia’u, alaila, o kou kino ka uku, a i eo wau ia oe, o ko’u kino ka uku.” Wahi a Halemano: “Ua holo ia pili a kaua.” A pau ka olelo ana no ka pili alaila, hoolei mai la o Kikekaala i ke kilu, aole i pa i ka pahu, lalau iho la o Halemano, a paa i ka lima, nana aku la a o ka noho mai a ka wahine, o Kamalalawalu me kona nani mae [ ] ole, hu mai la ke aloha ia Halemano no ka noho ana ia Puna me ka wahine. Nolaila, kau aku la o Halemano i keia kau olioli, no Kamalalawalu, penei:","A few days after this Kikekaala issued an order which was carried from one end of Kohala to the other, inviting everybody to come to the game of kilu , at Lolehale, the most famous place at the time for exhibitions of this kind. This place is situated on a hill looking to the west, close to Puuonale and Hokukekii. After everybody had come, Halemano was then sent for. Upon his arrival, Kikekaala said to him: “I will make a wager with you. If I beat you in the kilu throwing then you shall belong to me. And if you should beat me, I shall belong to you.” Halemano then said: “The wager is satisfactory.” As soon as the wager was settled Kikekaala began by throwing the kilu at the mark; but it missed and Halemano picked it up. As he looked and saw Kamalalawalu [ ] sitting there in all her beauty and grace, his mind went back to the days when he and his wife lived in Puna; so he chanted a few lines to Kamalalawalu as follows:"
"Alahula Puna i ke ahi a Laka, E halaoa mai ana i kuu maka. Ka ulu hala i kai o Kookoolau, He ane lalau ko’u ia oe; O keia mea o ka hilahila, hoi no ai. Auwe kuu wahine—a! Kuu wahine mai ke kai nui o Puna Ke kapi ae la i na pali kahakai. Kaha ke aloha hoolalau i Kaimu, Mu ka waha heahea ole mai. Kuu wahine o ka hale makamaka ole, O ia hale kuleana ole a’u i alo ai, I pukui aku ai au me ka la i Maliu—e! E maliu i kuu leo uwalo—e! Kuu wahine hoi—e—a.","A kapu is placed over the roads of Puna by the fire of Laka, For I see its reflection in my eyes. It is like the breadfruit in the lowlands of Kookoolau; I am almost tempted to pick it; Being repelled by shame, I touch it not. Alas, my love! My love from the big sea of Puna Whose waves beat on the sea cliffs. You forget your lover while you went astray in Kaimu, Your mouth was closed, refusing to call. My love of the home where we were friendless, That home to which we had no claim, though I made no complaint, Where I drew warmth from the sun at Maliu. Take heed to my supplications My own, my love!"
"A pau ke oli ana a Halemano, pehi aku la ia i ke kilu, a pa i ka pahu, alaila helu mai la ka helu ai, penei: “Auwe! Auwe! Akahi kaua i lalo la.” Lalau hou o Halemano i ke kilu a paa i ka lima, nana aku la no i ka wahine a o ka noho mai, aohe like o ka maikai me ko na wahine e ae, he oioi wale no kela o ka nani a me ke kelakela, nolaila, nana aku la a kulu haloiloi iho ka waimaka. Hu mai la ke aloha o ka wahine, i ka hele i ka hala o Puna, a me ka heenalu i Kaimu, alaila, oli aku la:","At the close of the chant of Halemano, he threw the kilu and it hit the mark, whereat the gamekeeper said: “Alas, alas, we count one down!” Halemano again picked up the kilu and held it in his hand; then looked at his wife, whom he saw was not like the other women, being far superior in looks, therefore his eyes were filled with tears, and a great love for his wife came over him as he remembered their walks amidst the hala trees of Puna, and their surf riding at Kaimu; he therefore chanted the following lines:"
"Ke kua ia mai la e ke kai ka hala o Puna, E halaoa ana me he kanaka la, Lulumi iho la i ke kai o Hilo—e, Hanuu ke kai i luna o Mokuola. Ua ola ae nei loko i ko aloha—e, He kokua ka inaina no ke kanaka; Hele kuewa au i ke alanui e, Pela, peia, pehea au e ke aloha? Auwe kuu wahine—a!

Hoi mai kaua, he a’u koolau keia. Kuu wahine hoi e, hoi mai. [ ] Hoi mai kaua e hoopumehana, Ka makamaka o ia aina makua ole.","The sea is cutting down the hala trees of Puna, They stand up like people, Like a multitude in the lowlands of Hilo. The sea is rising by steps to flood Mokuola. Life is once more alive within me for love of you, For anger is a helper to man. As I roamed over the highways friendless, That way and this way, what of me my love? Alas, my own dear love! My companion of the low hanging breadfruit of Kalapana, Of the cold sun that rises at Kumukahi. The love of a wife is indeed above all else, For my temples are burning, And my middle is cold because of your love, And my body is under bonds to her. Come back to me, for this is a Koolau sphere, My love, come back. [ ] Come back and let us warm each other with love, The only friend of a land that is friendless."
"A pau ke oli ana a Halemano, pehi aku la i ke kilu, pa aku la ka pahu, helu mai la ka helu ai, alua. Lalau hou o Halemano i ke kilu a paa no i ka lima, nana aku i ka wahine a o ka halokoloko mai o na waimaka, hu mai la ke aloha ia Halemano, no ka noho ana me ka wahine i Uluomalama, i Waiakea, ma Hilo. Oli aku la o Halemano, me ka waimaka e nuu ana i ka lima, penei:","At the close of this chant by Halemano, he again threw the kilu and it hit the mark, giving him two points. Halemano then took up the kilu and held it in his hand. He then looked at his wife, and when he saw the tears in her eyes his love for her again welled up within him as he remembered how they had lived at Uluomalama in Waiakea, Hilo; so he chanted, while he wiped away the tears with his hand, as follows:"
"Noho i Hilo i o maua hale—e, He hale noho i Panaewa e; Maewaewa i ka hale kuleana ole, Hookahi no kuleana o kuu kino e. He kini, he lehu, kahawai o Hilo e, Pali kui ka hale a ke aloha i alo ai.

Kuu wahine hoi e!","We once lived in Hilo, in our own home, Our home that was in Panaewa. For we had suffered in the home that was not ours, For I had but one friend, myself. The streams of Hilo are innumerable, The high cliffs was the home where we lived. Alas, my love of the lehua blossoms of Mokupane! The lehua blossoms were braided with the hala blossoms, For our love for one another was all we had. The rain only fell at Leleiwi, As it came creeping over the hala trees at Pomaikai, At the place where I was punished through love. Alas, O my love! My love from the leaping cliffs of Piikea; From the waters of Wailuku where the people are carried under, Which we had to go through to get to the many cliffs of Hilo, Those solemn cliffs that are bare of people, Peopled by you and I alone, my love, You, my own love!"
"A pau ke oli ana a Halemano, pehi aku la ia i ke kilu pa i ka pahu, helu ekolu. Lalau hou i ke kilu a paa i ka lima, nana aku la o Halemano ia Kikekaala, he okoa kona kii a me kona kulana, he hele ma Ewa ma kahi o ke kikane, a nana aku la hoi ia Kamalalawalu, he keu ae ia mamua o na wahine a pau i loko o ia anaina kilu, “he oioi no Maui Hikina.” Nolaila, komo aku la no ka iini ia Kamalalawalu, a kau aku la no o Halemano i keia mele nona, penei:","At the close of this chant, Halemano again threw the kilu at the mark and hit it, counting him three. He then again picked up the kilu and held it in his hand. Halemano then looked at Kikekaala and noted the difference between her and Kamalalawalu, who was by far more beautiful than all the other women that had gathered there to witness the contest, for the old saying was indeed true that “East Maui is prominent.” Halemano therefore could not help but admire Kamalalawalu, and so he chanted the following lines in her honor:"
"He anu au la he koekoe, Ma ko poli au e ke aloha e. Holo i Kalena ia uka o Haleauau, Ka nahele anu i Wahiawa e. He wa olelo na ka noe i Kaala, Ke huea mai la e ke kehau, Ka noenoe aala a ke kupukupu o Lihue.

We have roamed over Kalena in the uplands of Haleauau, In the cold thickets at Wahiawa. It was during the days of the heavy fog at Kaala, For the cold was brought forth by the dew Together with the fragrance of the kupukupu of Lihue. The false cold is uncovered at Waikoloa For my love was exposed by the tears, As we met at Kalena in Haleauau. [ ] O my love, come back to me! The thick groves at Kumanomano Are being trampled by the summer sun; It lingers for the sun of Kaelo and Ikiiki, And for the bunches of awa of Makalii. Love is like a chief, it is prized highly, For it is the screen by night and by day. O my love, come back, For love is like food that cannot be taken!"
"A waiho o Halemano i ke oli ana, kilu aku la a pa i ka pahu, helu iho la, aha. Lalau hou i ke kilu a paa i ka lima, oli hou o Halemano.","At the end of this chant Halemano threw the kilu and it hit the mark, counting him four. He then picked up the kilu and held it in his hand as he chanted the following lines:"
"Kuu wahine mai ka ua popo kapa o Kalihi Ke ahai la ma ke kua ka malu; Ke nounou mai la e ka Waahila, Ka ua kaili wahine o kuu aina. Huli ae la Kaala kau i luna, Waiho wale kai o Pokai, Nana wale ke aloha i Honouliuli, Kokolo kehau he makani no Lihue, He lino wahahee na ka la i Kaena, Ua hao—a mai la e ka unulau o lalo, Anuanu loko huihui i ke aloha, Aloha ka wahine ka hoa noho o ia kula panoa.","My lover from the Kalihi rain, where the clothes are bundled up, Where the back is the only sheltered spot; It is being pressed by the Waahila [rain], The rain of my land where women are led away secretly. Search is made to the top of Kaala, The lower end of Pokai is plainly seen. Love looks in from Honouliuli, The dew comes creeping, it is like the wind of Lihue, Like a false gleaming of the sun at Kaena, For it is being destroyed by the Unulau wind from below, Causing coldness within, made so by love of thee, For I love thee, my companion of that parched plain."
"A waiho o Halemano i ke oli ana, nou aku la ia i ke kilu a pa i ka pahu, helu iho la alima. Lalau hou no i ke kilu a paa i ka lima oli hou no.",Halemano here ceased chanting and threw the kilu again hitting the mark and thus counting five. He took the kilu up and held it in his hand as he chanted the following lines:
"A kukui au a Kahewahewa, Ku au nana i laila, Haloiloi kuu waimaka e uwe, Nani na hala ka oiwi o Kahuku, I ka lawe a ka makani he mikioi. Mai Kuahea au i hele mai ai, Ahea hoi au e ke hoa pono iho?

How beautiful are the hala, native trees of Kahuku, As they are being fanned by the Mikioi wind. I have come from Kuahea. When am I to be contented, O my love? My love, O come back! For love has again entered my heart, For it pains me in my effort to withhold it, My love, O my love, come back!"
"Lalau hou o Halemano i ke kilu, a paa i ka lima, nana aku i ka wahine, a o ka lumilumi mai i ka waimaka, hu ae la ke aloha o Halemano, i ka noho ana i ka lai o Waialua a me ke kehau anu o Kaala, me ka wahine, a oli ae la, penei:","At this stage Halemano grasped the kilu more firmly as he looked at his wife. Upon seeing her tears, the love within him grew stronger as he was reminded of the calm of Waialua and of the cold dews of Kaala, where they had roamed in days gone by; so he continued with these lines:"
"A nui mai ke kai o Waialua, Moe pupuu Kalena i Haleauau, [ ] Au mai ana kona aloha i o’u nei, I kuu ike ole ia Lihue kela aina nana i ka lani, Kuhi ae la no ia waena he kai e. Auwe kuu wahine e!

Auwe kuu wahine e!","When the sea rises at Waialua, One doubles up in sleep at Kalena in Haleauau. [ ] There her love comes swimming to me, When I can no more see Lihue, that land that looks to heaven, Believing that over yonder is the sea. O my own love! Kaala stands up majestic; It is a cold head covered with dew, For it is the cold wind that brings fragrance; It is being wafted here by the Waikoloa wind, For Pulee is searching for me. Alas, O my love!"
"Kiola o Halemano i ke kilu, a pa i ka pahu, helu aono. Lalau hou o Halemano i ke kilu a paa i ka lima, oli hou:","Halemano then threw the kilu and it again hit the mark, counting him six. He then took up the kilu and held it in his hand as he chanted the following lines:"
"Na pua i Halemano ka’u aloha, Ua nahu a kikepa ia e ka manu, Hele mai ke ala me ke onaona, Noho mai la ka maikai ka nani o Malama e! Malamalama loko o’u e noho nei, Akaaka loko i ka ike a ke aloha, O aloha au, o maliu mai oe, Auwe kuu wahine e!

For within me I am enlightened, as I sit The secrets within me are seen through love. I am the lover, be compassionate. Alas, O my love! My lover from the cliffs of Koolau, Where the cliffs are above and below the pathway, And love is made a pathway for the tears. O my love, come back!"
"Pehi aku la o Halemano i ke kilu a pa i ka pahu, helu mai la ka helu ai, o ka hiku ia. Lalau hou no o Halemano i ke kilu a paa i ka lima.

Halemano again took up the kilu and held it in his hand; then he looked at Kikekaala and from her to Kamalalawalu. He then bent forward and wiped away the tears from his face, for his mind went back to the time when they lived in the forests of Moelana in Kakele, Koolaupoko, Oahu; he therefore chanted the following lines:"
"Wela Koolau i na keiki uwe anu, Kuu aina kaikua e noho ai, A kuu hoa e noho la i ka lai, I walea i ka ua Kanikoo o Heeia, I ka ua poai lau awa o Moelana Me he keiki makua ole la ka hone, Ka hoolaau i kuu kino e, Ka elele waha ole a ka manao.

My love, O come, come back!"

The contest was then ended and they prepared to retire, according to the [ ] wager. As they were leaving the kilu house, Kamalalawalu stepped in between Kikekaala and Halemano, ready to ask to be forgiven, but Kikekaala pulled Halemano away, saying to Kamalalawalu: “You deserted him and here you are coming after him again. He shall not return to you.” As Kikekaala and Halemano departed, Kamalalawalu stood there weeping; she placed her hands at her back and as the tears flowed down her face, she chanted the following lines:"
"Wela Koolau i ke ahi e, Wela Koolau i ke ahi a ka wahine; Ke noa la i ka uka o Hamakua, I ka pokepoke a ka makani, A wela ka ukiuki me ka huhu, O ka inaina o ke ino nau na kui.","Koolau is burning with fire, Koolau is burning with the fire of the goddess; It is raging in the uplands of Hamakua, It is being cut up by the wind, Causing anger and hatred, Ill feeling and bad thoughts."

The closing lines are in reference to her. Kamalalawalu then continued:"

My companion of the cold watery home of Hilo. I am from Hilo, from the calabash of Kulukulua, From the arched sands at Waiolama, From the rain that pelts the leaves of the breadfruit of Piihonua; For we live at the breadfruit trees of Malama. Love is shown by the tears, Love is the friend of my companion, My companion of the thick forests of Panaewa, Where you and I have trod without a third party; Our only fellow traveler was my love, The only right we had for living in the uplands of Laa, For my body is sacred to thee, my love. Alas, O my companion, my love! My love of the cold, watery home of Hilo, That friendless home where you and I lived."

When she did, she saw Kikekaala biting Halemano in the side, so she chanted the following lines:"
"Hoolawehala ka nanahu a ke kupa, Akaaka ka malihini he mea hewa ia, Puni hoi i ka ua awa a ka wahine, I wahine au i kane oe, Kuu kane o ka ua kanikani lehua o Makaulele Ke haki manua mai la i ka lae o Kumukahi; Akahi la a ke aloha i hiki ai.

I must be your wife and you my husband, My husband of the Kanikani rain of the lehua trees of Makaulele. It is being broken in large pieces at Kumukahi Point, For love has come for the first time this day. Like the mouth of the Ohele stream, it is changeable, For the clouds are gathering in the uplands of Piihonua, O my love of the cold, watery home of Hilo! [ ]"
"A pau keia oli ana a Kamalalawalu, lawe aku la na ilamuku o Kikekaala a ma kahi e hoonoho, alaila, oli hou o Kamalalawalu, penei:","At the close of the chant, Kamalalawalu was removed by force by the officers of Kikekaala to some other place. As she was being led away she chanted these lines:"
"A pa ka makani he Koolauwahine, E ike aku auanei oe ia Haili, Haili kula lehua i wilia e ka manu; Ke lawe la ke awa kau laau o Puna, Ka oo kani leo lea i ka nahele, E ano wale mai ana no i ke ahiahi.

My companion of the cold, watery home of Hilo, That cold wet home where you and I lived, O my own beloved husband!"
"A pau ke oli ana a Kamalalawalu, olelo aku o Kikekaala: “Aole au kane, no ka mea, he wahine haalele kane oe, a eia ka e kii hou mai ana; aole e hoi aku ke kane me oe.”","At the end of this chant by Kamalalawalu, Kikekaala said to her: “You have no husband because you are a woman who has deserted her husband. I see that you have come back to him, but he will not go back to you.”"
"Mahope o laila, noho iho la o Halemano me kana wahine hou me Kikekaala; aole wa kaawale, i ke ao a me ka po, i na la a pau loa; nolaila, uluhua a ikiiki loa o Halemano i ka paa mau i loko o ka hale.

She held him very closely by day and by night, and followed him wherever he went, therefore he became weary and greatly vexed at her for keeping him shut up in the house continuously. Because of this Halemano one day said to Kikekaala: “Say, I hear that aku has become plentiful at the Makaiula fishing grounds in Kaelehuluhulu. You must therefore allow me to go and catch us some.” Kikekaala said: “We must go together.” Halemano said: “It will only delay me. You must stay home. I will go alone and shall return in no time.” The wife at last consented and Halemano set out."
"Ma keia holo ana a Halemano, holo mai la ia mai Puaawela ma Kohala, a hiki i Mokulau ma Maui, pae. O Kamalalawalu hoi, holo mai la ia mai Kohala mai a pae ma Hamoa ma Hana i Maui, hele ae la ia ma Koolau o Maui, a pela no hoi o Halemano, hele ma ke komohana o Maui a hiki i Lahaina.","On this trip Halemano set out from Puaawela in Kohala; but instead of going fishing, he set out for Mokulau in Maui, where he landed. Kamalalawalu, on the other hand, set out soon after Halemano from Kohala, and landed at Hamoa, in Hana, Maui, and from that place continued on her way along the Koolau side of Maui. Halemano continued his journey along the west side of Maui, next landing at Lahaina."
"Ma keia haele ana o laua, ua hahai na kanaka, ia laua, no ka makemake i ka wahine a me ke kane, i ka maikai a me ka nani launa ole. O ke kumu o ko Kamalalawalu hahai ia Halemano, o ke aloha no.

Kamalalawalu followed Halemano because she found that she loved him and wished to be taken back. In this journey, Halemano next [ ] stopped at Hawe and Kekaa, Kaanapali, and from this place he set out for Mokuhooneki on Molokai, then landing at Waikolu, on the Kalaupapa side, where he stayed for some time. When Kamalalawalu set out from Hana she landed at Kapua in Kaanapali, then boarded a canoe and landed at Kaluaaha, West Molokai, and from that place continued on to Kaluakoi and Kaunakakai."

Kamalalawalu, on the other hand, after leaving Molokai, landed at Waikiki; then from this place she next landed at Ewa; then at Pokai; and from this place she continued on to Kauai, landing at Wailua where she stayed . Halemano in the meantime also set out and he too landed at Wailua, where he met Kamalalawalu and had a friendly talk, but their living together was not harmonious as before. Kamalalawalu therefore returned with a sad heart. She then took a canoe and set out from Kauai and landed at Kaena Point; from this place she continued on her way to Waialua. From there she journeyed to Kahuku; then to Hauula; and then to Kualoa, where she met Waiahole, a chief of that place who was a single man. He took Kamalalawalu as his wife and they resided there together."

By this canoe word was carried to Kamiloholuiwaiakea that Kamalalawalu was living in Oahu. As soon as he received this information he immediately set out and informed Huaa the king of Puna of the fact; and from there word was carried to Kulukulua the king of Hilo. After the two came together to discuss the matter, they said: “Yes, we have given her our properties with the idea of getting her to be our wife, but we did not succeed. Let us therefore go and make war on those with whom she is now living.”"

Moe a ao ae.","As soon as they decided upon doing this they began to prepare about eight thousand canoes, and also got together a very large body of men who were armed with all kinds of weapons, both large and small. Because of this vast undertaking, the kings and their men spent over fifty days in the preparation for the expedition. As soon as everything was ready they set out, coming along the Koolau side (east) of Maui and touched at Kekaa in Kaanapali, where they landed and stayed over night. The next day they again set out, coming past Halawa and Waikolu and touching at Kalaupapa, Molokai, where they landed to spend the night."
"I aku o Huaa ke ’lii o Puna ia Kulukulua: “E, o na kahuna a me ke kilo, ke kuhikuhi puuone, ke hai mai i ka pono o keia hele ana aku.” A hiki lakou i mua o na ’lii, olelo mai na ’lii: “O ka oukou ike ke olelo mai.” Olelo aku ke kilo o Kalapana: “E moe hou kakou i anei, i keia la a me ka po, apopo kakou holo.” Ae mai na ’lii; moe lakou [ ] a ao ae, hai aku ke kilo, i kana olelo ike, penei: “I holo kakou i ka moana, a i uhi ka noe ma ka hikina, na kakou ka make, a ina i pamaloo a pae kakou i uka, na Oahu ka make. Eia ka lua; i halii ka ua koko i ka moana a hiki i ka aina, hee o Oahu ia kakou.”","On the next day Huaa, the king of Puna, said to Kulukulua: “Let us consult the priests, the astrologers and diviners as to our proper course and also as to the outcome of this expedition.” When the priests, astrologers and diviners came in the presence of the two kings, they were asked: “Let us hear what you have to say as to our future course?” The astrologer from Kalapana then spoke out: “Let us again spend this day and night in this place and tomorrow we may continue on our journey.” The two kings consented to this and another night was spent at the place. On the next day [ ] the astrologer said: “If after we set out a thick fog comes from the east, we will win the day; but if hot, warm weather is encountered all the way until we land, Oahu will be victorious. The second sign is this: if we encounter a heavy rain and the rainbow is seen and these things keep up until we reach land, we will rout Oahu.”"
"A pau ka olelo ana a ke kilo, holo aku la lakou, a pae ma Makapuu, hoonoho ke kaua.

In coming across the channel they encountered a thick fog and rain, the signs of victory predicted by the astrologer. After the armies were placed in line they advanced overland, going by way of Kaneohe. At Kaneohe proper they met the enemy and the fighting began. Early in the battle Oahu was routed and a great slaughter took place at Waiahole. After the battle Kamalalawalu was found, still alive, and she was taken by the kings of Hawaii, Huaa and Kulukulua, to Hawaii. [ ]"
"O Kailua i Kona, Hawaii, ka aina hanau o Keaweikekahialii, i ka wa e noho ana o Keliiokaloa he ’lii no Hawaii a puni.

Keliiokaloa was a great king and had something like eight hundred chiefs under him. Amongst these chiefs was one, Kalapanakuioiomoa, the progenitor of the kings of Hawaii. Keaweikekahialii had an attendant by the name of Mao, who was a man of great learning. His chief ambition was the study of how his charge was to get control of the government, and in some way become the king of Hawaii."
"I kekahi la, hoouna aku la o Keliiokaloa i na ’lii a pau loa e pii e koele me na kanaka a pau loa; a pau lakou i ka pii, noho iho la o Keliiokaloa me Keaweikekahialii.

After everybody had gone, Keliiokaloa and Keaweikekahialii remained at home playing konane . Keaweikekahialii had lost three games to Keliiokaloa and the fourth game was also about to be lost, when Mao came in. Mao had secreted on his person a long stone club, about two feet in length and covered over with a network of cords. As he stood before them watching the game he asked: “Whose are the white pebbles?” Keaweikekahialii answered: “The white pebbles are Keliiokaloa’s and the black ones are mine.” At this time there were but very few black pebbles left on the board, in other words Keaweikekahialii was about to again lose to Keliiokaloa."
"Olelo aku o Mao: “Ua make ia oe e Keaweikekahialii.” “Pehea ka make ana ia’u?” “Penei: Hapala ke kea, na ka ele ka ai.” I mai o Keaweikekahialii: “Kau pohaku make hahau ia.” I aku o Mao: “Hahau no au make o Keliiokaloa.” Ekolu kena ana a Keaweikekahialii.

Olelo mai o Keaweikekahialii: “Kupanaha oe, eia ka he pepehi kau i ke alii a make, kai no paha he konane maoli kau, aole ka.” I mai o Mao: “Aole ka ou makemake e puni o Hawaii ia kaua? Eia ka la o ko aina.”","Mao then said to Keaweikekahialii: “You will win.” “How am I to win?” “The white ones are besmeared, the black ones will win.” Keaweikekahialii answered: “Take the losing blacks then and make your move.” Mao answered: “If I make the move Keliiokaloa will lose.” Keaweikekahialii then urged Mao three times; at last Mao asked: “If I make the move will you assist me?” “Yes,” said Keaweikekahialii. [ ] Mao then took up the stone club and struck Keliiokaloa on the back of the neck, killing him instantly. Keaweikekahialii then said to Mao: “How strange of you! Here you have gone and killed the king. I thought yours was to be a move on the konane board, but it was not.” Mao then said: “Don’t you want to rule over the whole of Hawaii? You shall become the ruler of this land this day.”"
"Lawe aku la laua kanu ia Keliiokaloa, a nalo, hoi mai la a hiki i ka hale, olelo aku o Mao ia Keaweikekahialii: “E hoouna aku oe i ke kanaka i uka, e olelo aku penei, i olelo mai nei ke ’lii o Keliiokaloa.

After the arrival of his men he gave them orders to kill the first chief and his servant as soon as they arrived. Upon the arrival of one of the chiefs and his servant they were both set on and killed. This was carried on until all the chiefs of Hawaii were killed, except Kalapanakuioiomoa."
"A ike o Kalapanakuioiomoa e make ana na ’lii a pau loa, mahuka mai la ia ma ka nahele a hiki i Waipio noho, moe iho la i ka wahine kuaaina, nolaila, a hapai ka wahine, holo mai la ia a pae ma Kaluaihakoko, i Maui, pae, mai laila aku a pae ma Maunalei i Lanai, alaila, noho o Kalapanakuioiomoa.

In course of time his wife conceived a child; but taking a canoe he set out, landing at Kaluaihakoko, Maui. From this place he again sailed and landed at Maunalei, Lanai, where he settled down and made his residence. After Kalapanakuioiomoa had been in Lanai for some time, he took unto himself a wife there and lived as a commoner, tilling the land and going to the uplands for water. He lived without disclosing his rank or his identity to any one."
"A mahope, imi ia iho la ia ma Hawaii a puni; o ke kumu o keia imi ana, i loaa ka mea e laha ai na ’lii o Hawaii, a hiki i Maui, imi ia iho la, aole he loaa. A pau o Maui i ka huli ia, aole i loaa o Kalapanakuioiomoa; nolaila, hiki ka huli i Lanai, i laila loaa o Kalapanakuioiomoa.","Shortly after this a search was made around Hawaii for him. The reason of the search was in order to get some one to again marry with the high chiefess of the land that the high rank blood chiefs of Hawaii be again increased. This search was carried on in Maui, but no trace of him could be discovered. After the search on Maui, it was renewed on Lanai, where Kalapanakuioiomoa was at last found."
"I aku ka poe huli: “E ke ’lii, i kauoha mai o Keaweikekahialii ia oe e hoi i Hawaii, i kumu hoolaha no na ’lii.” I aku o Kalapanakuioiomoa: “Aole au e hoi aku me oe, no ka mea, ua hoohiki au i anei a make; nolaila, e hoi a hiki i Hawaii, kii aku, aia ke ’lii i Waipio kahi i noho ai, he kaikamahine na’u aia i laila kahi i noho ai.” Hoi aku la na elele i Hawaii, a hiki i Waipio, lawe ae la i ke kaikamahine a Kalapanakuioiomoa, a lilo ae la i kupuna no na ’lii o Hawaii, a malaila mai ka laha ana o na ’lii a hiki i keia la. [ ]","When the searchers found him they said: “O chief, the king Keaweikekahialii wishes you to return to Hawaii and perpetuate the blue blood of the chiefs.” Kalapanakuioiomoa answered: “I will not return with you because I have made oath that I will live and die here; therefore you must go back to Hawaii and go to Waipio, where you will find a chiefess of high blood, my daughter.” The messengers then returned to Hawaii and to Waipio, where the daughter of Kalapanakuioiomoa was living and took her to the king. Thus did Kalapanakuioiomoa become the ancestor of the kings of Hawaii, for by him was the blue blood perpetuated to this day."

This is the way the legend is told to the people even at this time of writing. We must, however, look into the story and see if it is true or not. In this legend, it is said, that it was at the land of Kahikihonuakele, down in the bottom of the deep ocean, where it lies to this day, that the heroine of this legend came from, a land all in darkness, having neither sun, moon nor stars, and it was here that the parents and brothers and sisters of Hinaaimalama lived."

But the ancestors and parents of Hinaaimalama were great chiefs and chiefesses, and Hinaaimalama was very pleasant to look upon. She had no equal in all the land of her birth."

From these two Hinaluaikoa, a girl was born. After her came Kukeapua, a boy. From these two, who lived as husband and wife, the brother taking the sister to wife, several boys and girls were born."
"O ka mea nona keia kaao, o Hinaaimalama ia, he punahele ia i ko lakou makuakane, he milimili, a he oi kona ui a me kona nani i ko na kaikamahine a pau o kona hanauna. A nolaila, ua hoolilo ko lakou makuakane i alii, a i mea kapu loa, a o kona hoanoho pu, o kona pokii kane, o Kipapalauulu. Nolaila, hoonoho aku ko lakou makuakane ia Kipapalauulu, i kiai; ma kahi a Hinaaimalama e noho ai, a e hele ai, e auau ai, e hana lepo ai, malaila o Kipapalauulu e kiai ai me ka malama loa.","By Kukeapua, the husband, Hinaluaikoa the wife gave birth to: Hinaakeahi, a female; Hinaaimalama, a female; Hinapalehoano, a female; Hinaluaimoa, a female; Iheihe, a male, who sometimes turned into a rooster; Moahalehaku, a female; Kiimaluhaku, a female; Kanikaea, a female, who sometimes turned into a hen; Kipapalauulu, a male; Luaehu, a male, who sometimes turned into the fish, known as ulua . The heroine of this legend was Hinaaimalama, who was the favorite child of the father’s and was his idol. She was the most beautiful of all the girls, and because of this fact, he made her queen and placed her under the strictest kapu; and her companion was her brother Kipapalauulu, the one next to the youngest, therefore their father placed Kipapalauulu as the guard of Hinaaimalama. Kipapalauulu had to go wherever Hinaaimalama went, whether at bathing or at any other place, which duty the brother faithfully kept."
"Ma keia kauoha, ua hoolohe o Kipapalauulu a malama loa, aka, mahope poina loa ia. Nolaila hele hookahi aku la o Hinaaimalama i ka auau, a ma keia auau ana, ike mai la ko lakou makuakane, aole o Kipapalauulu i hele pu, nolaila, huhu loa iho la ia. Alaila, kahea aku la ia ia Kipapalauulu: “Ea, heaha kou mea i malama ole ai i kuu kauoha?” I aku o Kipapalauulu: “Ua hoolohe au a hiki i keia auau hookahi ana, aole [ ] au i hele pu, no kuu ike no, i na auau ana a pau loa, aole au e launa aku ana i ke ’lii, no ka mea, i ka wa e auau ai, he nui loa ka mea nana e holoi a e kawele ka ili o ke ’lii, nolaila, manao iho la au, aohe a’u hana e hele aku ai.” Alaila, pane mai la ko lakou makuakane: “No kou malama ole i ka’u kauoha, nolaila e ku oe a hele mai kuu alo aku; no ka mea, o ka hoolohe, aole e haalele i kekahi leo e like me oe.”","Having thus been placed as guard, Kipapalauulu had to give up everything else and he went on with his duty, and for a long time he faithfully followed out the order of his father; but there came a time when he became negligent and finally one day Hinaaimalama went out bathing by herself. While Hinaaimalama was bathing their father saw that Kipapalauulu was not with her, so he became very angry and called for Kipapalauulu. When Kipapalauulu came before his father, he asked him: “Say, why did you fail to keep my order?” Kipapalauulu replied: “I have been faithful to my [ ] charge and this is the only time that I did not accompany her when she went out bathing. I did not accompany her while bathing because there were always a lot of servants who attended to her, so I concluded this time not to go out with her.” The father then said: “Because you have failed in this I am going to send you away from my presence. For had you kept my order and had been faithful, you would not have done what you did this day.”"
"A lohe o Kipapalauulu i kona hookuke ia, alaila, i aku ia i kona kaikuahine alii haku, ia Hinaaimalama: “E, ke hele nei au; eia ko ai a me ko ia la, he mahina ka ai, he hoku ka ia, hoo iho la ke kaikuahine i loko o kahi ipu, o Kipapalauulu kona inoa, mamuli o ka inoa o kona kaikunane.","When Kipapalauulu heard that he must get away from his father’s presence, he turned to his sister, Hinaaimalama and said: “I am going, so here is your food and here is your fish.” The food was the moon and the fish were the stars. The sister then took these things and put them into a calabash, called Kipapalauulu, after her brother."
"A pau ke kauoha a me ka olelo i kona kaikuahine, hele aku la ia, a na kupuna o lakou, hai aku la i kona hele, a me ka hookuke ana a ko lakou makuakane ia ia. Mahope o laila, nonoi aku la ia i alanui e hele ai, a e hiki ai ke pii mai i luna nei, mai lalo mai o ke kai.

A komo iho la ka malamalama o ka la i lalo, alaila, pii mai la o Kipapalauulu a hiki i luna nei. A kau oia ma ka ili o ka moana hohonu, nana ae la ia, he aina, he lani, he ao, he malamalama, he akea, alaila, au mai la ia, a pae ma Kawaluna, he aina i ka lewa o ka moana loa. O Konikonia ke ’lii nui o Kawaluna, aohe ana wahine, he ’lii kanaka maikai loa ia.","After the sister had imparted certain instructions to her brother, he proceeded to where his grandparents were living and told them of his going away because his father had banished him from his presence. After speaking about these things for a while, he asked his grandparents the way of getting out of the place to the surface of the earth, from the bottom of the sea. After his grandparents had heard what he wanted, his grandfather broke open the ocean and a crack was made from the floor of the ocean to the surface above, allowing the bright rays of the sun to reach the bottom. By this means Kipapalauulu climbed up until he arrived on the surface. Reaching the surface of the deep ocean, he looked about him and saw land, heaven, clouds, light, and a vast beyond. He then swam for the land and after a time landed at Kawaluna, a land at the outskirts of the great ocean. Konikonia was the king of Kawaluna, and he was without a wife. He was a king of very handsome appearance."
"A pae o Kipapalauulu i laila, kokolo hele mai la ia a moe ma lalo o na waa, ma keia moe ana, he maikai loa kona kino, he opiopio, he nani, a he memele maikai kona ili. Ia ia e moe ana, hele mai la ka iwikuamoo o ke ’lii, o Konikonia, a nana iho la i keia mea ula e moe ana, a ike iho la i ka maikai a me ka nani, hoi aku la a olelo ia Konikonia. A hiki aku la ka iwikuamoo i mua o Konikonia, hai aku la i na mea a pau ana i ike ai no ke keiki, alaila, kena ae la ke ’lii e kii a lawe mai. A hiki mai la o Kipapalauulu i ka hale o ke ’lii, lawe ae la oia ia ia i aikane nana, a noho iho la laua.","When Kipapalauulu came ashore on this island, he crawled under some canoes and slept there. He was a very comely fellow, young, of commanding appearance and ruddy complexion. While he was sleeping the king’s immediate attendant, called iwikuamoo , came up to the place and saw a man with ruddy complexion sleeping under one of the canoes, and seeing that he was good, and handsome, he returned and told Konikonia. When the king’s personal attendant came in the presence of the king he told him how he had found a boy. The king then told the man to go and bring the boy to him. Upon the arrival of Kipapalauulu at the king’s house, the king took him to be his friend and from that time they lived on together."
"Ma keia noho ana, ua hilahila o Kipapalauulu no kona malama pono ia e ke ’lii e Konikonia. Nolaila, haawi aku la ia ia Hinaaimalama, i kona kaikuahine i wahine nana, a lilo ae la o Konikonia i kaikoeke nona, a noho iho la lakou. Ma keia noho ana, hanau ka Konikonia laua o Hinaaimalama. Eia ka inoa o na keiki a laua, na keiki kane, a me na kaikamahine. Na Kane: Kaneaukai, Kanehulikoa, Kanemilohai, Kaneapua, Maikoha. Na Wahine: Kaihukoa, Ihuanu, Ihukoko, Kaihukuuna, Kaihuopalaai.","In this living together, Kipapalauulu felt under deep obligation to the king for the kind treatment he was receiving, so he decided that he would send for his sister, Hinaaimalama, and give her to the king to be his wife. When the sister of Kipapalauulu arrived in the presence of Konikonia he immediately fell in love with her and he took her to be his wife, and they all lived in happiness together. In course of time Konikonia and Hinaaimalama had sons and daughters. Following are the names of the children. The sons: Kaneaukai, Kanehulikoa, Kanemilohai, Kaneapua, Maikoha. The daughters: Kaihukoa, Ihuanu, Ihukoko, Kaihukuuna, Kaihuopalaai."
"Maanei e maopopo ai ia kakou, he mau akua kekahi, a he mau ia kekahi, pela no a hiki i keia la a kakou e noho nei. Nolaila, ma loko o keia hoomaka ana e maopopo ai ko lakou ano a me ka hana ana. [ ]",By this and the following story we will know that some of the beings who inhabited this world were gods and some were fishes and this fact remains to this day. In this legend we will be made to understand their characters and their doings. [ ]
"He keiki koa loa ia, a he keiki makau ole, a nana i haihai na pahu kapu, na anuu, a me na puloulou, na mea kapu, a pau loa. No keia mau hana a Maikoha, huhu loa o Konikonia ko lakou makuakane.

Nolaila, hookuke aku la ia ia Maikoha e hele i kona wahi e hele ai.","This was a very brave and fearless young man, and it was this man that broke the kapu poles, the sacred places of worship, the kapu insignia and all the different sacred things. Because of these doings of Maikoha, the father, Konikonia, became very angry. He was not sure which one had done this unholy thing, so he pondered deeply on how he was to find out the guilty person. After spending several days in study he decided on a certain course as follows: he procured two long poles and tied one of them on the back of the necks of all his ten children and the other he tied under the chin. He thought within himself that the one who would not cry would be the guilty one, a sure proof he thought, and he must be sent away. In applying this test, Maikoha was the one who did not cry out, all the other children cried more or less. This satisfied the father that Maikoha was the guilty one and so he was sent away, to go wherever he pleased."
"Hele aku la o Maikoha a noho ma Kaupo i Maui, a malaila oia i lilo ai i wauke kapa a hiki i keia la, a oia wauke no ko Kaupo e ulu nei. No ka mea, o ko Maikoha kino, he ano huluhulu heuheu, e like no me ko ka wauke ano a kakou e ike nei.","Maikoha then started out and landed at Kaupo, Maui, where he made his home. Here he changed into the wauke plant, which is known by this name to this day, and it was at Kaupo that this plant first grew. Because Maikoha’s body was very hairy the wauke plant is therefore the same, as we see."
"Ma keia hele ana mai o Maikoha, hele mai kona mau kaikuahine e imi ia ia, a hiki lakou i Kaupo, e ku ana i laila o Maikoha ua lilo i wauke. Nana lakou i ke kino o ka wauke mai luna a lalo, aohe loaa o ka piko, aka, ua huna o Maikoha malalo o ka lepo i kona piko. Nolaila, huli iho la na kaikuahine a loaa. A haalele lakou ia Maikoha i Kaupo ma Maui, hele mai la lakou a hiki ma Oahu.","After Maikoha had departed from home, his sisters came in search of him and they traveled as far as Kaupo, where they found he had already changed into the wauke plant. After they had located him they began to make a search for his navel, looking from the top of the plant to the bottom, but they were unable to find it; so a search was made of the roots, and there they found it, for Maikoha had secreted it there. Shortly after this the sisters left Maikoha in Kaupo, Maui, and they continued on their journey until they arrived in Oahu."
"Ike aku la o Kaihuopalaai i ka maikai o Kapapaapuhi, he kane e noho ana ma Honouliuli, ma Ewa. Moe iho la laua, a noho iho la o Kaihuopalaai i laila a hiki i keia la. Oia kela loko kai e hoopuni ia nei i ka anae, nona na ia he nui loa, a hiki i keia kakau ana.","Upon their arrival on Oahu, Kaihuopalaai saw a goodly man by the name of Kapapaapuhi who was living at Honouliuli, Ewa; she fell in love with him and they were united, so Kaihuopalaai has remained in Ewa to this day. She was changed into that fish pond in which mullet are kept and fattened, and this fish pond is used for that purpose to this day."
"A noho o Kaihuopalaai i laila, hele aku la kona mau hoahanau a hiki ma Waianae, moe o Kaihukoa me Kaena, he kane ia e noho ana i laila. He kanaka maikai loa o Kaena, a he ’lii no hoi no Waianae. Nolaila, noho o Kaihukoa malaila a hiki i keia la, oia kela koa ma waho o ka lae o Kaena. A o na ia i hele pu mai me ia, oia ka ulua, ke kahala, ka mahimahi.","When Kaihuopalaai decided to live in Ewa, her sisters proceeded on to Waianae, where Kaihukoa decided to make her home and she was married to Kaena, a man who was living at this place, a very handsome man and a chief of Waianae. So she remained in Waianae and she is there to this day. She changed into that fishing ground directly out from the Kaena Point, and the fishes that came with her were the ulua, the kahala and the mahimahi ."
"A noho ia i Waianae, hele aku kona mau hoahanau a hiki ma Waialua, loaa o [ ] Kawailoa ia Ihukoko, he kane ia, a noho iho la me ia. O ka ia i hele pu mai me Ihukoko, o ke aholehole.","When Kaihukoa decided to stay in Waianae, the remaining sisters continued on to Waialua, where Kawailoa met Ihukoko. Kawailoa was a single man and as he fell in [ ] love with Ihukoko the two were united and they became husband and wife. Ihukoko remained here, and the fish that accompanied her from their home was the aholehole ."
"A noho ia i laila, hele aku la o Kaihukuuna, a hiki i Laie, loaa o Laniloa, he kane ia, a noho iho la laua. O ka ia i hele mai me Kaihukuuna, he anae, a hiki i keia la.","When Ihukoko decided to remain in Waialua, the sister that was left, Kahukuuna, continued on her way until she came to Laie where she met Laniloa, a goodly man, and they lived together as husband and wife. The fish that came with her was the mullet and it too remained there to this day."
"A pau lakou i ka moe kane ma Oahu nei, alaila, hele mai ko lakou kaikunane mua loa, o Kaneaukai ka inoa. O kona kino he pauku laau, a pae ma ke kahakai o Kealia, ma Mokuleia, i Kawaihapai ma Waialua. Malaila kahi i lana ai, me ke kaa i uka, i kai. A mahope, hele a kino kanaka aku la o Kaneaukai, a hiki ma Kapaeloa e noho ana elua elemakule.","After the sisters were all married and had been living with their husbands on Oahu for some time, Kaneaukai their oldest brother came in search of them. This man’s body was in the shape of a log of wood, and after he had floated on the surface of the ocean for several days, it drifted to the seashore at Kealia in Mokuleia, Kawaihapai, Waialua, where it was carried in and out by the tide. After being in this form for some time it changed into a human being and journeyed to Kapaeloa, where two old men were living."
"Ia ia i hiki aku ai i kahi o na elemakule, e kahumu ana laua; a kalua ka umu, hele aku la laua e lawaia. Ia laua e lawaia ana, aohe loaa o ka ia, nolaila, hea aku o Kaneaukai: “E na elemakule, owai ka olua akua e kaumaha nei?” I mai na elemakule: “O ke ’kua ka maua e kaumaha nei aohe loaa o ka inoa.” I aku o Kaneaukai: “Ua loaa, a i kaumaha olua, penei e olelo ai, ‘eia ka ai a me ka ia e Kaneaukai,’ oia ka inoa o ke ’kua.” Ae aku na elemakule: “Ae, akahi no a loaa ia maua ka inoa o ke ’kua.” Nolaila, hoomana ia a hiki i keia la. A ua lilo o Kaneaukai i akua lawaia no laua, a me na mea e ae, ke manao laua pela. [ ]","When he approached the home of the two old men, he saw them watching an umu (oven), and after it was covered up they set out to the beach to do some fishing. After fishing for some time without success Kaneaukai called out to them: “Say, you old men, which god do you worship and keep?” The old men replied: “We are worshiping a god, but we do not know his name.” Kaneaukai then said: “You will now hear and know his name. When you let down your net again, call out, ‘Here is the food and fish, Kaneaukai,’ that is the name of the god.” The old men assented to this, saying: “Yes, this is the first time that we have learned his name.” Because of this fact, Kaneaukai is the fish god worshiped by many to this day, for Kaneaukai became their fish god, and from them others, if they so desired.

He had no compeer in these Islands from Hawaii to Niihau, according to his size for bravery. His father was Kauluakahai of Kahikipapaialewa, a land in great Kahiki. Pokai was his mother. His father was a great chief and had a godly relationship. Hoaeae, in Ewa, was the place where they met as man and wife and begat Namakaokapaoo. When Pokai was enceinte of Namakaokapaoo, Kauluakahai went back to his own land, leaving Pokai in that condition until childbirth. When the child was born Pokai and her child Namakaokapaoo were quite destitute, and while they were in that condition of life a good man named Pualii came from Lihue to fish at Honouliuli. He turned in at the home of Pokai. He looked at her and had a yearning for her. He said: “I desire you to be my wife.” Pokai returned: “How could you have a desire for me, seeing that I have already given birth to a child, and my body is defiled?” Pualii answered: “There’s nothing in those things if you desire our union.” Pokai then assented and went with her husband Pualii, and resided at the plans of Keahumoa. (Kula-o-Keahumoa.) They lived there tilling the soil. Pualii had two large potato patches which remain to this day; they are called Namakaokapaoo. When the potatoes were ripe Pualii made a vow that when the head of an ulua fish and the potatoes were roasted, and Pualii had first eaten thereof, then the potatoes would be free, and that his wife and others could eat thereof. Therefore Pualii went down to Honouliuli to catch the fish to be eaten together with the potato."

Penei ua pule la:","When Pualii was gone Namakaokapaoo, with seventeen other youngsters, went to Pualii’s potato patches. Namakaokapaoo was only a very small child then, standing two and a half feet high, had not eaten adult food. He had not worn a girdle (malo), and was yet in a state of nudity. When they arrived at the potato patches he told the boys to dig up the potatoes and pull up all the vines, and allow nothing to stand in the patches. But the boys were afraid and only dug up the potatoes without pulling up the vines. Namakaokapaoo then started to pull up everything from both patches until the vines were piled up high in [ ] stacks. There were forty such stacks from the two fields. He thereafter started a fire and roasted thereon four clusters of potatoes. While he was cooking his potatoes his stepfather came home and asked his mother Pokai: “Did you send your child to pull up my potatoes?” Pokai said: “No.” Pualii then said: “Well, this day his head and eyes will be meat for my potato meal. This day he shall die at my hands.” He seized an axe and went out to the field where he found Namakaokapaoo roasting his four clusters of potatoes in the fire. All the other boys ran off and stood at a distance for fear of Pualii. Pualii then said to Namakaokapaoo: “Say, I have in my hand an axe with which to cut off your head this day, and when your head is off it will be roasted with potatoes so that I may eat first and then it (the potato) will be free.” Namakaokapaoo paid no attention to these words of Pualii, who repeated them after an interval. And while Pualii was about to cut Namakaokapaoo with the axe, the latter just then delivered his death prayer against Pualii. The prayer follows:"
"Aloha wale ka maka o a’u wahi paoo, E hapupuu, e hapapaa mai nei, E ai paha, e waiho paha, E waiho paha Nakukuiaimakaokalani, O Kukuiaimakaokalani kela, O ku’u wahi aikane keia, O Namakaokaia ke’lii nui o Hawaii.

Vanquished, yes, vanquished is the coward; The man with the spear, The spear and the drum, Shall be vanquished by Namakaokapaoo."

I mai o Namakaokapaoo: “Heaha mai nei ka oukou o onei?” I aku lakou: “I hele mai nei makou e kaua me Namakaokapaoo, he wahi keiki uuku elike me oe, he ikaika a me ke koa loa, nana no i pepehi i kona makuakane o Pualii.” I aku o Namakaokapaoo: “Ua ike au, he kanaka nui no o Namakaokapaoo, a ua hele aku nei ma Koolau, a owau he inoa nona.” I mai lakou: “Aole o oe no, pela ko makou lohe, nolaila, e make ana oe ia makou, aole oe e ola.” I aku o Namakaokapaoo: “Hoi aku hoi ha kakou ilalo e hakaka ai.” A hiki lakou ilalo, e hao aku ana o Namakaokapaoo, pau loa i ka make, a koe aku hookahi kanaka, oia kai holo aku a loaa o Amau ma Waikiki, olelo aku la ia i ka make o lakou a pau loa, a koe ia i ahailono e lohe ai o Amau.","At the time that Namakaokapaoo ended his prayer, Pualii struck at Namakaokapaoo with the axe, but the sharp edge of the axe turned on himself cutting off and throwing his head some distance, from whence it said: “Farewell to thee, Namakaokapaoo.” Namakaokapaoo picked up Pualii’s head and threw it towards Waipouli, a cave situated on the beach at Honouliuli (a distance of about five miles). After Pualii’s death Namakaokapaoo went back to his mother. He did not eat any food. At that time Amau, a king of Oahu, was residing at Waikiki. A certain man of Honouliuli came to Waikiki, to where the king was stopping, and said to him: “Your majesty, there is a very strong little boy, who killed his stepfather and threw his (father’s) head a very long distance, about five miles.” When Amau heard this he said: “He is indeed strong if he kills me; but if he does not kill me he is not strong.” While he was talking at Waikiki, Namakaokapaoo heard [ ] all of this talk about himself. He then took and hid his mother in the cave at Waipouli, after which he came back to their house at Keahumoa. He went up on the roof of the house and parted the front and rear thatchings on the ridge and slept there. Amau the king sent four companies of men, each company consisting of forty-eight men. When they arrived at Keahumoa they entered the house and found no person in it. And when they were preparing to leave Namakaokapaoo called to them from the ridge. When they heard the voice without seeing anybody, they asked: “Where are you talking from?” Namakaokapaoo answered: “I am up here.” Eight men climbed up on the roof, four from the rear and four from the front, and found Namakaokapaoo. He asked them: “What do you want here?” And they said: “We have come to fight Namakaokapaoo, a small boy just like you, who is very strong and brave, and who killed his father Pualii.” He answered and said: “I know; Namakaokapaoo is quite a big man. He has gone to Koolau. I am his namesake.” And they said to him: “No, no, you are the one, so we heard; therefore we will kill you; you shall not live.” Namakaokapaoo then said: “Let us go down and fight it out then.” As soon as they were on the ground Namakaokapaoo made a clean sweep, killing them all excepting one man, who ran and met Amau at Waikiki, and reported their total annihilation with the exception of himself."
"A lohe o Amau, hoomakaukau ihola ia i kona mau waa kaua he umikumamawalu, a holo aku la i lalo o Ewa e kaua me Namakaokapaoo. A hiki o Amau me kona poe kanaka ma Ewa, e noke mai ana o Namakaokapaoo i ka luku a pau loa, aohe kanaka koe, a make ihola o Amau. Puni aela o Oahu nei ia Namakaokapaoo, alaila, kii aku la ia i kona makuahine a hoonoho ihola i luna o ka aina Oahu nei.","When Amau heard this he prepared eighteen war canoes, and set sail for Ewa to fight Namakaokapaoo. When Amau and his men arrived at Ewa, they were suddenly exterminated by Namakaokapaoo, not a single man escaping. And thus Amau died. Oahu being completely conquered, Namakaokapaoo went and brought his mother and placed her as ruler over the land of Oahu."
"A puni Oahu nei ia Namakaokapaoo, makemake ihola ia e holo i Hawaii e makaikai ai. Alaila, kii aku la ia he wahi hokeo waiho kapa nona, na kona makuakane i waiho nona. O kahi i waiho ai ua wahi hokeo la, makai o Kualakai, oia kela ulu e ku nei a hiki i keia la ma Kualakai. Oia ke kino ulu o kona makuakane o Kahaiulu. Hoi ke kino maoli, koe ke kino ulu, ma ke ano akua keia kino. Aia maloko o ka hokeo ke kapa a me ka malo, a me ka aahu alii, he aahu ahuula.","After the complete possession of Oahu by Namakaokapaoo, he was desirous of visiting Hawaii for observation. He then went and got a small gourd wherein to place his garments which his father had left him. This gourd was deposited at Kualakai, where a breadfruit tree is standing to this day. This is the breadfruit impersonation of his father, Kahaiulu. When the real person went home the breadfruit tree remained, being in the supernatural state."
"A loaa ka hokeo, hele maila ia a hiki ma Hanauma, ma Maunalua, ilaila ka waa e hoomakaukau ana e holo i Hawaii, e lawe ana i kapa no ke ’lii o Hawaii. Elua kanaka e hoomakaukau ana e holo, ninau aku o Namakaokapaoo: “E holo ana ko olua waa i hea?” [ ] Olelo mai laua: “I Hawaii.” I aku o Namakaokapaoo: “Aole la hoi e pono au ke holo pu me olua?” Hoole mai na kanaka: “Aole oe e holo me maua, no ka mea, he ukana ka maua e lawe nei no ke ’lii, ina oe e kau, poino ka waiwai o ke ’lii, komo ka waa, nolaila, aole oe hele me maua.” A makaukau ka waa o ua mau kanaka nei e holo, kau aku la keia mahope o ka momoa o ka waa, a holo aku la, me ka ikeole mai o ua mau kanaka nei ia ia nei.","Inside of the gourd was a garment, a girdle and a royal cloak (feather cloak). After he had obtained the gourd he journeyed on till he reached Hanauma, in Maunalua. There he found a canoe which was preparing to sail for Hawaii, bearing garments for the king of Hawaii. There were two men preparing to set sail, so Namakaokapaoo asked them: “Where is your canoe sailing to?” “To Hawaii,” they answered. Namakaokapaoo again asked: “Can I not go with you two?” The men refused, saying: [ ] “You cannot go with us, because we are taking goods for the king, and if you are to go the canoe would be overloaded and the king’s goods damaged. Therefore, you cannot go with us.” But when the men were ready to sail, he slipped in unnoticed by the men, and secreted himself in the rear of the canoe."
"A waena lakou o ka moana, huli ko Oahu nei ale, huli o Molokai ale, loaa lakou i ke kaumuku, oia ko Kalae o Kalaau makani, a hala ia, loaa lakou i ka makani o Kiawela, he kuehuehu ia makani. Na ia makani lakou i lawe a pae ma Kekaa ma Maui. E manao ana ua mau kanaka nei e pae malaila, aka hoohuli aela keia ma ka momoa o ka waa, a holo hou i ka moana.","When they were in midocean where the seas of Oahu and those of Molokai met, they encountered the kaumuku , a regular breeze from the Cape of Kalaau ( Ka Lae o Kalaau ). After they had passed it they encountered the breeze from Kawela. This breeze was the kuehuehu . It was this breeze that bore them to a landing at Kekaa, on Maui. The men had expected to make a landing at that place, but Namakaokapaoo made a turn with the end ( momoa ) of the canoe, which sent it out oceanward. By taking this course they arrived at Keauhou, in Kona, Hawaii, where the king Namakaokalani was stopping."
"Ma keia holo ana a lakou pae ma Keauhou, i Kona, Hawaii, ilaila ke ’lii o Namakaokalani kahi i noho ai. Alaila, hele aku la o Namakaokapaoo, a loaa ewalu keiki e kea pua ana, he poe keiki nunui lakou, a he poe keiki akamai i ke kea pua.

They were big boys and quite proficient in the sport. Namakaokapaoo asked them: “Are you skilful in arrow shooting?” They replied: “Yes.” He again asked: “How can you show your cleverness?” “Oh, an arrow can go quite a distance inland then drop, and sometimes nearly the whole length of a division of land” (ahupuaa). Namakaokapaoo then said: “That is not cleverness; neither is the arrow a long distance flyer. A good flyer would flit to the boundary of this division of land, then shake itself and continue on for four divisions; then it is named by the parent’s appellation. Such is the arrow in my place.”"
"A lohe na keiki kahaha loa lakou, me ka huhu ia Namakaokapaoo.

He then said: “Let me see one of your arrows.” One boy handed him his arrow. He looked it over and finally said: “Your arrow is a lehua , a lehua which stands in the dung-hill. It is not a flyer. It will only dip because of the weight at the head.” At these words the boys became very much infuriated and asked him to make a wager. Namakaokapaoo agreed. The boys put up five canoe houses and five net houses. Namakaokapaoo wagered his own person and life. And when the stakes were agreed upon they went to the boundary of Keauhou, where the arrow flitting sport was to be contested. While they were on the way, they were met by Namakaokaia, son of Namakaokalani, king of Hawaii. He asked Namakaokapaoo: “Where are you from?” “I am from Oahu, and have come for a visit,” answered Namakaokapaoo. “What is your name?” “My name is Namakaokapaoo.” “Are you then the small boy who slew Amau, king of Oahu?” “Yes (the death of Amau had already been reported in Hawaii), because you and your father were in my prayer, which runs thus:"
"Aloha wale ka maka o a’u paoo, E haapupu, e haapapaa, mai nei, E ai paha, e waiho paha, E waiho paha na Namakaokalani, O Namakaokalani kela, O ku’u wahi aikane keia, o Namakaokaia, [ ] A hee la, a hee, hee a ka hohewale, O kanaka no me ka ihe, O ka ihe no me ka pahu, Make no ia Namakaokapaoo.","O how I long for the eyes of my little fishes (paoo’s), For which I am undecided, wavering, Whether to eat, or whether to leave, To leave for Namakaokalani. That is Namakaokalani, This is my little friend, Namakaokaia. Vanquished! Vanquished! [ ] Yea, vanquished is the coward, The man with spear; With spear and drum, Shall be vanquished by Namakaokapaoo."
"A lohe o Namakaokaia i keia mau olelo a Namakaokapaoo, lawe aku la ia ia i aikane, a noho pu ihola laua, me ke kapu loa.","When Namakaokaia heard these words of Namakaokapaoo, he adopted him as his bosom friend, and they lived together in the most restricted sacredness."
"Ia wa, e kaua ana o Namakaokalani me Ku, ke ’lii o Puna a me Kau, a ua kokoke e pau loa ka aina i ka lilo ia Ku. Nolaila, olelo aku o Namakaokapaoo ia Namakaokalani a me Namakaokaia: “E noho maile olua, nau e hele aku e kaua.” I aku o Namakaokapaoo: “Ahea kaua oukou?” I mai o Namakaokalani: “Elua la i koe alaila kaua makou, o ko’u la ia nele au i ka aina ole, alaila, pau loa o Hawaii nei no Ku.” Aia me Ku elua kanaka koa loa, a me ka ikaika loa.

Therefore Namakaokapaoo told Namakaokalani and Namakaokaia: “You two stay back; let me do the fighting.” He asked them: “When will you fight?” Namakaokalani answered: “In two days we will fight. That is the day that I would be devoid of all my possessions and all Hawaii would belong to Ku. There are with Ku two very brave and very strong men. One, who is Kahuaai, is a very powerful soldier, who has a thorny spear for a weapon, and who never misses when he throws it at a man or any other object. Kaunakiki is a soldier whose strength lies in breaking a man to pieces; if he caught a man he (the man) would be all broken up before he reached the ground. Therefore Ku insists on the battle taking place; he has no fear or dread, because he relies on these men.”"
"A hala na la elua, makaukau ke kaua ma Kawaihae, hele mai o Namakaokapaoo me ke aikane o Namakaokaia, a hiki ma Kawaihae, e noho ana o Ku ke alii.

[ ]","After two days had passed the battle was ready to be fought at Kawaihae. Namakaokapaoo with his friend Namakaokaia then came to Kawaihae, where Ku, the king, was abiding. When they came near to where Ku was sitting, Namakaokapaoo ran up to Ku, took hold of his head and pushing it back broke his neck, and the king died. All Hawaii was thus subdued by Namakaokalani, and Namakaokapaoo reigned as king. After several ten day periods Namakaokapaoo left Hawaii and returned to Oahu, and from Oahu he visited his father Kauluakahai, in Kahikipapaialewa, where the story of Namakaokapaoo ends. [ ]"

Whenever the possessor of these shells went out squid fishing all that was necessary to do was to take and expose them and the squids would come up and enter the canoe. This was Keaau’s regular occupation every day. The existence of these extraordinary shells was in time carried to Umi, who was then living in Kona. Whereupon he ordered his messengers to go to the home of Keaau and obtain possession of them, and at their demand the shells were given up and the messengers returned with them to the king."
"A hiki i Puna aohe aihue akamai, hiki i Kau, aole no, hiki i Kona, aole no, hiki i Kohala, Hamakua, Hilo, aole no he aihue akamai.

After studying for a time for means of recovering the shells, he one day prepared his canoe for sea, procured a pig, some awa and ouholowai and eleuli, kapas of Olaa. The kapas he put into a calabash and then the pig, the awa and the calabash were placed into the canoe, which he then boarded and set out on a journey around Hawaii in search of some one who could steal back his shells from Umi."
"Olelo mai ke kamaaina: “Ua loaa, e holo oe a hiki i Makapuu, a hala ia mahope ou, kau pono aku ko waa i na moku manu a me Mokapu, a ku pono i laila nana aku i ka pali e halehale mai ana, he luna ia, he lalo ka pohai kukui, aia i laila o Iwa, keiki aihue a Kukui.”","All through the district of Puna he found no smart thief. He next traveled through the district of Kau, without success; then through Kona, still unable to find his man. He next touched at Kohala, and on through that district and the district of Hamakua and Hilo, meeting with the same failure; he found no one smart enough. Keaau then left Hawaii for Maui and traveled around that island; still he met the same disappointment. He found men good in the art of stealing, but none smart enough to recover his shells. He next set out for Lanai and traveled around that island, but he met the same fate. He then set out for Molokai and journeyed around it till, off the point of Kalaeokalaau, he met a man of that island who was out fishing. The man upon seeing him called out, saying: “Where is your canoe sailing for?” Keaau replied: “I am in search of a person who can steal back my leho shells from Umi. I have here with me [ ] in my canoe several valuable things which I shall give as presents to the thief who could return my shells to me.” The man replied: “You have found him. You sail on until you come to Makapuu and after you have passed that place steer your canoe for a point between the bird islands and Mokapu. When you reach that point look for the cliff which resembles the roof of a house, above, and directly below the cliff you will see a grove of Kukui trees; there you will find Iwa, the thieving son of Kukui.”"
"(No Iwa, he wahi keiki uuku o Iwa, i loko no o ka opu, hele e aihue, a he oi o Iwa ma ke akamai ia hana.)","(Iwa was a small boy at this time, but while he was yet in his mother’s womb he used to go out stealing. He was the greatest thief in his day.)"
"“A hiki oe, nana aku i kahi keiki uuku e lewalewa ana kahi mai, e holo ana i ka lae kahakai, o Iwa ia. Uhau aku oe i ka puaa, a haawi aku i na waiwai a pau loa, mai hoopoina oe, o pau ka waiwai i ka aihue ia e Iwa.”","“When you come to land, look for a small boy who goes about along the beach without a loin cloth; that is Iwa. Take out your pig and the other articles of value and lay them before him. Don’t forget this, else all your things will be stolen from you by Iwa.”"

Upon touching land he looked about him and saw a small boy without his loin cloth running along the beach. Keaau then called out to him: “Is your name Iwa?” The boy replied: “No, Iwa is at the house.” When Keaau arrived at the house he found Kukui, the father of Iwa. Keaau then asked him: “Where is Iwa?” Kukui replied: “Did you not meet a small boy on the beach running about without his loin cloth?” “Yes, there was such a small boy.” “Go back and present him your pig.” When Keaau heard this, he returned and said to Iwa: “There, you are Iwa after all; you misdirected me.” Keaau then took the pig and presented it to Iwa saying: “Here, I present this to Iwa, the thieving son of Kukui, together with the articles of value in my canoe and the canoe itself.” Iwa then said to Keaau: “Let us return to the house.” When they arrived at the house, the pig was killed and put into the oven, and the awa was prepared. After the meal was over, Iwa turned and asked of Keaau: “What is the object of your journey that has brought you here?” Keaau replied: “I had two shells which were taken away from me by orders from the king, Umi, and he has them in his possession now. I value these shells so much that I am distracted, and that is the reason of my being present here.” “We must await until tomorrow morning,” said Iwa."
"Olelo mai o Iwa: “Hoi aku kaua i ka hale.” A hiki laua, kalua ka puaa, mama ka awa, ai a pau, ninau mai o Iwa: “Heaha kau huakai o ka hele ana mai?” Wahi a Keaau. “He mau leho na’u, ua kiina mai e ko makou alii e Umi, a lilo ia ia.

Ka ka hee hana ka pii a e komo ka waa, hoi i uka.","They retired for the night, and on daylight the next day they boarded the canoe and set out to sea. Iwa took the stern of the canoe with his paddle called Kapahi, while Keaau took the seat at the bow. After they were seated in the canoe, Iwa called out: “Kapahi, take Iwa out to sea,” at the same time he dipped his paddle into the sea. (This meant that one stroke of the paddle was all that was needed.) With this one stroke, they passed between Niihau and Kauai. Iwa then asked: “Have we arrived?” “This is not Hawaii, these islands are Kauai and Niihau.” Iwa then turned the stern of the canoe around and again called out to his paddle, Kapahi: “Kapahi, take Iwa out to sea.” When Iwa drew his paddle out of the sea they were passing outside of Kawaihoa. He then asked of Keaau: “Have we arrived at Hawaii?” “No,” said Keaau. Again Iwa took up his paddle and gave one stroke and they left Molokai and Lanai to their rear and they went floating between the island of Molokini and Pohakueaea, a point of land looking [ ] toward Hawaii. Iwa then asked: “Have we arrived?” “Yes,” replied Keaau, “but it is at that point of land where the cloud hangs over the mountain that we want to go; it is to the west of that point that Umi is now living.” Iwa then took up his paddle, Kapahi, and gave one stroke and they arrived outside of Kalaeakeahole, a point of land looking towards Kailua, where Umi had his residence. When they looked about them, they saw Umi just below them, in his canoe. Iwa then said to Keaau: “There is Umi in his canoe with the shells. Let us get our canoe to the rear and out of sight of Umi.” When they were some distance from Umi, Iwa said: “Say, Keaau, you must float right at this spot until I return with your shells.” Keaau therefore kept his canoe floating on the same spot while Iwa dove down and swam until he had reached the bottom of the ocean, then walked under water to the place where the canoe of Umi was floating, then swam up until he was almost up to the surface; and as the shells were being let down on the side of the canoe, Iwa grabbed them and took them down with him to a large coral, there he fastened the fish-line, then he took the shells and swam under water until he reached their canoe and got into it. The two then returned and landed at Leleiwi, in Hilo, where they made their home. Upon the recovery of his shells Keaau again took up his favorite occupation, that of squid fishing, taking along his shells, Kalokuna. The squids at sight of the shells climbed and entered the canoe until it was loaded down when they returned to shore."
"(Ma keia wahi e waiho ka olelo ana, a e hoi hou mahope ia Umi.)",(We will here leave Keaau and let us return to Umi.)
"A lilo mai na leho ia Iwa, noho o Umi me ka minamina, e manao ana he mau maoli ko na leho i lalo i ke koa.

Loaa no ia oe ke kii, ae aku o Iwa. “Ae.” Hele aku la o Iwa a hiki i o Keaau la, ma Leleiwi.","After the shells were taken by Iwa and the line fastened to a coral, Umi after a time pulled up on his line, but to his surprise it would not yield and thinking that the line was entangled to the coral he did not wish to pull very strong, thinking the line would break and he would lose the shells. Fearing he would lose them he remained in his canoe all day, and that night he slept out at sea with his men, and for some days he lived there, while his men dove down to untangle the fish-line and thus recover the much valued shells. Men noted for being able to stay under water a long time were sent for, and these men were told to go down, but the best they could do was to go down three times forty fathoms, seven hundred and twenty feet, not deep enough to reach the bottom where the line was tangled. This was kept up for a week. Umi then sent out his runners to make a circuit of Hawaii to look for a man who could stay under water long enough to recover the shells. In this trip around the island of Hawaii, Iwa was found at Leleiwi, the point of land adjoining Kumukahi, between Puna and Hilo. When Iwa heard the king’s wish through his runner, Iwa said to him: “There are no shells at the end of the line. The line only is fastened to some coral in the bottom of the ocean. The shells have been recovered by Keaau.” When the runner heard this he returned to Umi taking Iwa with him and told Umi of what he had heard from Iwa. Umi then asked Iwa regarding the shells and Iwa told Umi just what the runner had told him. At the close of the report Umi asked Iwa: “Can you get these shells for me if you should go for them?” Iwa replied: “Yes,” Iwa then journeyed back to the home of Keaau in Leleiwi."
"He mea mau ia Keaau, ka huna i na leho ai, oia o Kalokuna ma. Ma ka loha o [ ] ka hale o waho, e pili ana i ka hio kala, a o na leho ai ole, i loko pono lakou o ka hale e kau ai.","It was Keaau’s custom to hide these shells on the end of the house, up next to the [ ] curve of the rafters; and the other shells, the ones that he did not care so much for, he kept them in the house hung up on a cord."
"A poeleele, hoopuka loa aku la o Iwa i ka hale, lalau aku la i na leho a loaa, hoi aku la i o Umi la i Kona. Haawi aku la o Iwa i na leho ia Umi, a ike o Umi, olioli ia, a olelo mai ia Iwa: “Akamai oe i ka aihue.” Alia nae au e mahalo ia oe, a loaa kuu wahi koi, aia i lalo i Waipio, i ka heiau o Pakaalana, o Waipu ka inoa. Olelo aku o Iwa: “Loaa paha ia’u, aole paha? aka, e hoao wau.”","About dusk Iwa made his appearance near the house and knowing where the shells were secreted he went up and removed them from the place they were hidden and he then returned to Kona, and handed them over to Umi. When Umi saw the shells he was made very happy and he then said to Iwa: “You are a smart thief, but I am not going to praise you just yet, not until you can produce my axe, which is being kept in Waipio in the temple of Pakaalana. The name of the axe is Waipu.” Iwa then made reply: “I don’t know whether I will be able to steal it or not, but I shall try.”"
"(Maanei kakou e luaana iki iho ai no na olelo e pili ana i ke koi, a me na hana a na kiai.)",(We will here speak a few words relating to the axe and how it was kept by its guards.)
"O ua wahi koi nei o Waipu, he mau luahine elua na kiai, ua hana ia he kaula, paa he poo i ka ai o kekahi luahine, a o kekahi poo hoi i kekahi luahine, ma waena ke koi e lewalewa ai.","This axe, Waipu, was kept by two old women. It was fastened to the middle of a piece of rope and the ends of the rope were fastened around the necks of the two old women allowing the axe to dangle between the two."
"He kapu hoi, aohe kanaka maalo, aohe puaa holo, aohe ilio aoa, aohe moa kani, mai Waipio ke kapu a Puuepa, ma waena o Waimea a me Kawaihae, alaila pau.

Kapu ke kanaka a o e hele, kapu ka ilio a o e aoa, kapu ka moa a o e kani, kapu ka puaa aole e holo, e moe e!” Elima hele ana a keia luna ao ka po.","There was a very strict kapu placed on this axe; no person was allowed to pass near the place, and during the period of time when the kapu was in force, the pigs were not allowed to run about, the dogs were not allowed to bark, and even the roosters were kept from crowing. The kapu was extended from Waipio to Puuepa, a hill between Waimea and Kawaihae. At dusk, just before it gets real dark in the evening the crier would run from Puuepa to the cliff of Puaahuku overlooking Waipio, carrying oloa kapa in his right hand, held between the palm of the hand and the wrist as a flag and would cry out: “Sleep ye, sleep ye because of the axe of Umi. Persons are kapued from walking about, the dogs are kapued from barking, the roosters are kapued from crowing , the pigs are kapued from running about. Sleep ye.” The crier was required to make five trips back and forth before daylight."
"A pau ka olelo ana a Umi me Iwa, aui ka la. Hele mai la o Iwa, a ahiahi poeleele, hiki i Puuepa, holo o Iwa me ke kahea ana e like me ka luna holo mau mamua aku, me ka oloa i ka lima.

Iwa did not, however, wait for further directions but started out on his way to Waipio. Just before dusk he arrived at Puuepa and immediately started running and crying out like the king’s crier with a flag in his hand. He continued running until he reached the cliff of Puaahuku, looking down into Waipio. In calling out the way he did, the crier, whose duty it was to make the cry, was forced to go to sleep like the rest of the people, for to get up and go about meant death. Because of this Iwa was the only one about, all the people believed it was the usual crier and the crier himself believed that the king had appointed some one else to take his place. Furthermore the people could not recognize any difference; the build was the same, the flag looked the same, the voice sounded the same and the speed in running was the same."

Ina i piha ole kou hale, make oe, a pela hoi lakou.” “Ae,” aku o Iwa, “heaha la hoi, o ko lakou hale no ke piha, he nui lakou, a o e piha ko’u, he hookahi.”","Iwa continued running from the top of the cliff down to the temple of Pakaalana and then he called out: “Are you two still asleep?” The old women replied: “No, we [ ] are not asleep, we are still awake.” Iwa then asked quietly: “Where is the axe? Let me feel of it.” “Here it is,” answered the old women. “You must come nearer so that I can touch it with my hand. I just want to feel of it.” When the old women drew nearer to Iwa, he reached out and pulled at the axe, getting it away from them. The old women then called out: “Here is a thief! The king’s axe is gone! We are killed! We had thought this was a good man!” When the people heard this, they all got up and gave chase. When the old women made the first outcry, Iwa had reached the top of Puaahuku with the axe in hand. When the pursuers reached there he had reached Mahiki. This chase was kept up until Iwa reached Puuepa. When those in pursuit reached this place, he was at Puako. They therefore gave up the chase as the country beyond that place was outside of the kapued area, while Iwa continued on until he arrived in Kona. He then slept until daylight the next day. When it was about time for Umi to have his morning meal, Iwa went up to him. When Umi saw Iwa he asked jokingly: “I don’t think you have been able to get my axe.” Iwa then replied: “Perhaps not, but I want you to look at this axe and see if it is not yours.” When Umi saw it, he said: “How strange! I thought you never would be able to get it; but here you have gotten it. You are smart.” After this Umi said to Iwa: “Here is my thought regarding you. I want you to try with my six best thieves. There are two houses to be filled in one night, one for you and one for them. If you will not be able to fill yours first, you will be killed; so shall it be with the others.” Iwa then replied: “Yes, no doubt the others will fill theirs first for there are six of them. Mine will not be filled because I am alone.”"

While it was still daylight the six thieves went out to see what things they could steal; and when it became dark they began to steal and to carry everything they could lay their hands on into their house. This was kept up until the first cock crow, when there was very little room left in the house. At about this same time Iwa woke up and as soon as the six men went to sleep he proceeded to steal the things stolen by them of Umi’s men, men, women, children, canoes, animals and various other things. Before he could remove all the things into his house there was no space left, so he had to leave some of them. When it was daylight the next day they found that the house belonging to the six men was almost empty, while Iwa’s house was filled with the different things. The six men were therefore declared beaten and were killed in place of Iwa. [ ]"

After the death of his father there was left Punia and his mother, Hina. Their occupation consisted in the cultivation of sweet potatoes, and in this way they were supplied with food; but they had no fish or meat."
"I aku o Punia ia Hina: “E iho au i ka luu ula na kaua i ka lua ula a kuu makuakane.” Olelo mai o Hina: “Aole, o na lua ula, aohe kanaka ola.

When a person goes down he will never come up again, the sharks will eat him up.”"
"No Kaialeale. He mano ia, oia ke ’lii o na mano e ae, e noho ana i ka lua ula. He umi mano malalo ona, oia ka umikumamakahi.",Kaialeale. This was the name given to a very large shark which lived in that neighborhood and he was king of all the sharks which lived near this cave of lobsters. There were ten sharks under him; he was the eleventh.

Punia then called: “I wonder if that great shark called Kaialeale is still asleep. If he is I can dive down and come up at that point over yonder where I will get two lobsters, and my mother and I will have something to eat with our potatoes in the uplands.” While Punia was talking to Kaialeale the rest of the sharks woke up. Kaialeale then said to the other sharks: “Let us watch and see where Punia dives, then we will dive in after him.” Punia had a stone in his hand while he was talking which he threw out beyond the point where he spoke about diving to get the lobsters. When the stone struck the water the sharks made a dive for the place leaving the cave of lobsters unguarded. Punia then dove down and secured two lobsters and then addressed the sharks: “Here there, Punia has gone down and he has two lobsters, giving him something to live on. This will keep my mother and myself alive. It was the first shark, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, it was the eleventh shark that told me what to do, the one with the thin tail. He was the one that told me what to do.” When Kaialeale heard this from Punia, he ordered all the sharks to come together and get in a row. He then proceeded to count them, and sure [ ] enough there were ten of them, then he looked for the one with the thin tail. When he found the one he said: “So it was you that told Punia what to do. You shall die.” After this shark was killed, Punia called out: “So you have killed one of your own kind.” After this Punia returned home to his mother."

This trip may be your last. Don’t go down.” Punia, however, rose and went down to the cave of lobsters. When he came to the place, he called out as he did at the first time. Then when Kaialeale and the other sharks woke up he threw a stone toward the other side away from the cave. When the stone struck the water the sharks went after it. Punia then dove down and again got two lobsters. After he got ashore he called out to the sharks as he did at the other time and then counted out the sharks from the first to the tenth, and then named the tenth one as the one which told him what to do. “The one with the large stomach,” said Punia. Kaialeale then proceeded to count the sharks and when he found the one with the large stomach, he was killed by the others. Punia then followed out the same line of conversation as used by him at the former time."

After this Punia hewed out two sticks each a yard long; he next procured the two necessary sticks, a hard and a soft one, to make fire; then he procured some charcoal and kindling wood; then he prepared some food, salt, an opihi shell and put all these things into a bag. With this [bag] Punia proceeded to the beach and when he got directly over the cave, where Kaialeale was sleeping, he called out: “If when I dive down Kaialeale should bite me and I die and my blood should come to the surface, then my mother will see it and I shall come to life again. But if when I dive, Kaialeale should open wide his mouth so that I am swallowed whole, I shall die and will never be able to come to life again.” While Punia was talking, Kaialeale was listening, and he said to himself: “I will not bite you for you might come to life again. I shall open my mouth wide enough for you to walk in. So this is the time when I shall kill you. Yes, you shall die; nothing will save you.” Punia then dove down with his bag, when Kaialeale opened his mouth and Punia walked in. As soon as Punia got into the mouth it tried to close up, but Punia took the two sticks he had hewed out and stood them up which kept the mouth open. He then rubbed the two sticks and when the fire was started he placed on the coals; he next took out his opihi shell and began to scrape the inside of the shark and after he had a ball of meat he proceeded to cook it and when cooked he sat down and with his potatoes he made his meal, while the shark was swimming here and there through the ocean. This scraping hurt the shark so much that he could not keep still; he was forced to go here and there. Punia was carried around in the shark for about ten days, when at last the shark began to grow weak and it made its way back toward [ ] land, arriving outside of Kona, at a place called Alula, directly out of Hiiakanoholae. Punia on the other hand became bald, from being in its belly; the work of the rascal."

Make oe, aole ou wahi e ola ai.” A hiki laua nei i laila, olelo hou iho o Punia: “Ina o ke poi ana keia o ka nalu, ola no wau, aka, ina e lawe ia au a ke one maloo, e pili ana me ka nahelehele, make au, aole e ola.” Lawe hou o Kaialeale a hiki i laila, i hoi mai ka hana paa i ke one maloo.","When Punia heard the breakers on the shoals, he said: “If this is near the line of breakers I will be saved, but if I am to be taken to the edge of the deep sea, I will die.” When Kaialeale heard this he said: “I shall take you there then, where you will die by me. You shall die; nothing will save you.” When they reached there, Punia again said: “If this is where the surf breaks I shall be saved, but if I am to be taken to the dry sand near where the grass grows by the seashore, I will die and will not be saved.” Kaialeale upon hearing this took Punia until he reached the shrubs. When the shark attempted to return he was caught in the dry sand and there he laid."
"Ike mai la na kanaka i keia mea nui, hele mai la e nana, a lohe o Punia, kahea ae: “E akahele iho i ke kanaka o pepehi iho.” Hele mai la na kanaka me ka pahoa, kakaha i ka opu o ka mano. Puka ae la o Punia aohe lauoho, ua hulu ole.","When the people saw this great thing they came to look at it, and as they gathered around the shark, Punia heard the people talking, so he called out: “Be careful or you will kill me.” The people then took out their wooden knives and cut the shark open. Punia then came out. He was without any hair, being completely bald."
"No ku ’kua. O kahi kanaka iho la no ia, he ’kua wale mai no ma Keaukaha a me uka ae.","This was the only place where there were any people, all the rest of the place round about Keaukaha was inhabited by ghosts."
"Hele mai la o Punia ma ia wahi mai, a ike mai la i keia poe akua e hikii pohaku upena kuu ana i ka lae kahakai. Pea ae la na lima o Punia i ke kua, a uwe helu mai la i kahi a laua e lawaia ai me ka makuakane. He hoopunipuni keia hana a Punia i ke ’kua, i pakele ia i ka make.",After Punia got out of the shark he proceeded on his way and saw several ghosts with nets all busy tying on stones for sinkers to the bottom of the nets; this place was near the beach. At sight of the ghosts he placed his hands at his back and began wailing and recounting in a chant the different places where he used to go fishing with his father. In this Punia was trying to deceive the ghosts in order to save himself.
"Auwe no hoi kuu makuakane o keia kaha e! Elua wale no maua lawaia o keia wahi. Owau no o ko’u makuakane, E hoowili aku ai maua i ka ia o ianei. O kala, o ka uhu, o ka palani, O ka ia ku o ua wahi nei la, Ua hele wale ia no e maua keia kai la! Pau na kuuna, na lua, na puka ia. Make ko’u makuakane, koe au.","Alas, O my father of these coasts! We were the only two fishermen of this place, Myself and my father, Where we used to twist the fish up in the nets, The kala, the uhu, the palani, The transient fish of this place. We have traveled over all these seas, All the different places, the holes, the runs. Since you are dead, father, I am the only one left."
"I loko o keia hana a Punia, lohe kekahi mau akua, a olelo aku i ka nui o ke ’kua: “He leo hoi keia e uwe nei, eia la ke helu mai nei i kahi a laua e noho ai me ka makuakane.” Olelo aku kekahi akua: “He wi makani paha, a i ole ia, he keu pueo.” Olelo mai kekahi: “E hoolohe hou kakou i ka leo,” ia lakou akua e hoopaapaa ana, e hoolohe ana keia, na lakou la ka hoolai, uwe hou keia.","At the sound of the wailing one of the ghosts heard it and so spoke to some of the others: “I hear a voice as though wailing. There it is recounting the places where he used to live with his father.” One of the ghosts replied: “It must be the sound of the wind or else it is the hooting of an owl.” Another one replied: “Let us listen for the voice.” While they were discussing, Punia was listening too, and when they ceased talking and began listening, he started to wail again, saying:"
"A hooki o Punia i ka uwe ana, i aku kekahi akua i kekahi akua: “Pono ka upena a kakou ua loaa ke kamaaina, aole e lalau ke kuu ana o ka upena.” Kahea lakou nei: “Hele mai!” A lohe o Punia, hele mai la a hiki. Ninau aku lakou nei: “E uwe ana oe i ke aha?” I mai o Punia: “E uwe ana au i ko’u makuakane i ka maua kaha e lawaia ai, i ke ano wale mai no o ka pahoehoe, a, me he mea ala, oia okoa no.” I aku ke akua ia Punia: “Heaha la hoi, o oe ko makou kamaaina nana e kuhikuhi.

Pela no ka hana maalea ana a Punia a koe uuku ke akua. “Auhea iho la ka nui o makou!” “Eia no,” wahi a Punia, “ke wili nei i kala, i ka uhu, i ka nenue, i ka palani, i ka ia ku o ua aina nei la.” “Aole hoi ha i make,” pela ke ’kua. Oku hou o Punia i ka lima, i hookahi la. Au mai ana, elua la, au mai ana. Pela ka hana ana a pau ke akua i ka make, pakele aku hookahi. [ ]","When Punia ceased wailing, one of the ghosts said to another: “Our nets will be of some use now since here comes a man who is acquainted with this place and we will not be letting down our nets in the wrong place.” They then called out [to Punia]: “Come here.” When Punia heard this call he went up to the ghosts. They then asked him: “What are you crying about?” Punia replied: “I am crying because of my father; this is the place where we used to fish. When I saw the lava rocks, I thought of him.” The ghosts then said to Punia: “Well and good, you shall show us how and where to cast the nets and we will work under you.” Punia assented to this saying: “All right, if you carry out my instructions and do as I tell you we will catch all the fish you want. This is what I want you to do: Two of you must swim out with me while the rest shall stay ashore here; and when I call to some of you to swim out to us then come. When I stick up two fingers, that will mean that I want two to come; and if I stick up one finger, then I want one to come. That is the way the fish of this place are caught, because the bottom is all open and there are several places where the nets must be let down.” The ghosts all heard the instructions of Punia. Punia after this swam out with two of the ghosts, and after some little time he called out to the two ghosts to open out the nets and said: “When I give you the order to dive, then you must dive down and don’t come up again until I pull on the nets, for I see there is a large school of them here.” When the ghosts dove down Punia dove in after them and twisted the nets tangling up the ghosts and killing them. After these two were killed Punia came up to the surface and called out to those ashore holding up two fingers. Two more came swimming and again they were killed. He next called out and held up one finger and that one was also killed. Punia continued this deceit until there were but very few of the ghosts left alive. When the ghosts saw that Punia was the only one to be seen in the sea they called out to Punia: “Where are the rest of our companions?” “They are here,” replied Punia. “They are twisting up the kala, the uhu, the nenue, the palani and the transient fish of these waters.” The ghosts that were left then said one to another: “They are not killed.” Punia then held up one finger, calling for only one. One came out. Punia called for two and two swam out. Punia continued to do this until all but one of the ghosts were killed. [ ]"
"O Kahikinui ka aina, i Maui, o Kaipolohua ke kulanakauhale, o Lono ka makuakane o Pamano, o Kanaio ka makuahine, o Waipu ke kaikunane o Kanaio. Hanau na mua o Pamano, he mau wahine a make. O Pamano aku, oia kai ola, a nui o Pamano, ao i ka hula a me ke oli.","Kahikinui, in Maui, is the land in which Pamano was born; in the village of Kaipolohua. Lono was the father of Pamano and Kanaio was the mother. The brother of Kanaio was Waipu. Pamano had two sisters who were born before him, but they both died in their infancy and Pamano was the only one that was successfully brought up by the parents. When Pamano was full grown he began to study the arts of the hula and the oli (or chanting) of meles."
"Kui aku la ke kaulana i ka lea, a lohe o Koolau i uka o Mokulau, e waiho la i waena konu o Kaupo.

When Pamano arrived at that place he was seen by Kaiuli, the king of Maui, and Pamano being a handsome fellow, he was adopted by the king as a son, and in this way he became known as the brother of Keaka, the only daughter of Kaiuli. By being adopted Pamano was virtually made king of Maui. The first command given Pamano by Kaiuli was this: After calling for Pamano and his daughter Keaka to come to him, he said: “Where are you, my two children? I want you to listen to what I have to say. I want you, Pamano, to be good and not to touch your sister; and I want you, Keaka, to be good and not to touch your brother. If you two wish to go surf riding, each of you can go down and have your surf riding and then return straight home. Pamano must not enter the house of Keaka or you will die; and so with Keaka.”"

Keaka on the other hand had moved to Mokulau and she was at this time living there with her guardian, a man by the name of Koolau, a close friend of Pamano’s. In these daily trips down to enjoy the surf something happened one day which led to difficulties. This day, after Pamano and Koolau had finished bathing, they started on their return, and while on their way, in passing by the house of Keaka, she called out to them: “Come and get some fish for you two.” Upon hearing the call the two stood and looked at her. Keaka continued calling and beckoning them to come to her. The two therefore approached the wall surrounding the house and called out to Keaka: “Give us our fish.” She replied: “The fish have no legs. You two who have legs must come and get the fish yourselves.” [ ] The two then entered the yard. Keaka, however, went into the house and held up the fish, at the same time calling for one of them to come in and get them. The two stood there hesitating, not knowing what to do. She called again, whereupon Pamano reached and seized the fish, but Keaka jumped and held Pamano and then closed the door and fastened it. Koolau stood on the outside at the end of the house."
"Mamua ae, ua komo mua ka makemake ia Keaka no Pamano i ke kane maikai a me ka ui, a i keia hana ana pau loa kona mau iini i ka hooko ia. Ia wa kupapa laua me na kino, aole nae he moe.

No ka mea, he ua liilii ia wa. Ia wa kau aku la o Koolau:","Long before this Keaka had a longing desire to make advances on Pamano, for she was in love with him and, too, she thought that he would make her a good husband; besides, he was such a handsome fellow. At last her chance came and all her hopes were realized. At first they argued, but did not lie together, for Pamano said to Keaka: “I have vowed with Koolau that before I take a wife he must first have her; and this promise also holds good with him; before he takes a wife, I must first be favored; therefore we must call him in to fulfill the vow.” “No; [said she] why should we leave the matter to him, for who is he? Didn’t I bring up the shameless little thing? I will not call him in.” While the two were talking, Koolau awaited for the opening of the door and for the call for him to enter, for it was raining at the time. After waiting for some time, he chanted the following lines:"
"Nani ka oiwi o Hilo i ka lehua Ke ku la i ke one i Waiolama Nani ke kino o ia laau e! he laau, Hoolaau mai ana ka ia ia’u, I loaa ka hala, kaua, paio, A paio olua e!","How beautiful art thou Hilo, bedecked with lehua, Standing there on the sands of Waiolama! How beautiful is the body of that tree, that tree! For he has indeed forgotten me, Thus finding a fault for war, for strife, For you two are quarreling."
"I mai o Pamano: “Ae, o ka’u ia e olelo ae nei, aohe ae mai.”","To this chant Pamano replied: “Yes, that is just what I am saying, but she will not consent.”"
"Ka makani pipio lua i ka moae, Lele aku i ke kawa lele o Kaumaea, Maea ka lalo o ka wahine, A ua moku ka lelewa o Kukii i ka ino, Ke hala aku la maluna o Naunau, O Naue la hoi o maliu mai oe!","The wind that doubly sweeps by, the moae, Which leaps from the jumping off cliff of Kaumaea, For the love of women is indeed pleasant, For the rope which Kukii hung is broken by the storm That has passed over Naunau. Had it been Naue thou wouldst have obeyed."
"Pane mai o Pamano, o ka lua: “O ka’u ia e olelo nei aohe ae ia mai.”","Pamano then made answer the second time: “That is just what I am saying, but she will not give her consent.” At this reply Koolau faced about and returned to their house and slept. At the first cock crow, Pamano returned and went to sleep with Koolau."
"Ia wa huli aku la o Koolau hoi a ko laua hale me Pamano moe. A kani ka moa mua, hoi aku la o Pamano a me Koolau moe. A ao, papio iho la o Pamano i lalo ke alo a huli papu aku la. Nana mai la o Koolau i ka uli o ka aoao o Pamano, i ke nahu ia e Keaka. (I ka poaeae la ma lalo iho.) Oli mai la.","At daylight that morning Pamano awoke and turned his face downward still lying and looked down at Koolau. Koolau from his place looked at Pamano and saw that the sides of Pamano were blackened, just below the arm pits, bitten by Keaka. When Koolau saw this he chanted these words:"
"A pa malanai Hilo Waiakea, I pa ia e ka naenae, [ ] Lulu au hala, Kuu hala pee pa kai o Waiuli, Nawai ka uli ke nahu o kou ili, Oe e huna nei ia’u la.","As the wind gently sweeps over Waiakea, Hilo, So sweeps the naenae. [ ] My hala grove is becalmed, My hala grove that hides behind the wall in the lowlands of Waiuli. Why are your sides blackened, as though bitten? For you are attempting to conceal it from me."
"I aku o Pamano: “Ua ike no oe, na Keaka. Ia oe i hala mai ai, moe aku maua.” Ia wa, pii o Koolau e hai ia Kaiuli. Ia ia nae e pii aku ana i ke alanui, nana mai o Kaiuli a hoohewahewa mai.

O ka wahi o waho, o ko’u wahi kapa ia, o ka hikii, o ko’u wahi malo ia, nolaila, ua make.” Ninau mai o Kaiuli: “Heaha ka mea e make ai?” “He awa,” (pela aku o Waipu) “no ka mea o kana puni ia.” Mama ka awa, piha na umeke, na huawai, na ipukai. A pau ka awa i ka mama, ninau aku o Kaiuli ia Waipu: “Nawai e kii o Pamano?” “Nau,” Pela o Waipu.","Pamano then made reply: “You know, it was Keaka. After you came away we passed the evening together.” At the reply Koolau arose and went up to inform Kaiuli thereof. While he was on his way up, however, Kaiuli looked at him but was unable to recognize him; so he turned to his companions and asked: “Who is that coming up here?” Some one replied: “It is Koolau.” “No, that is some one else,” said another. This was kept up until Koolau was almost up to them, when their doubts were entirely removed, for they could plainly see that it was he. As he stood in their presence, Kaiuli asked him: “What has brought you up here so early?” “Yes, I came early because I have something to say. The chief and chiefess who live in the lowlands have sinned. Pamano has gone and slept with Keaka. That is the reason why I came up, that you should hear.” Kaiuli then asked of Waipu: “How about your nephew? Shall he live or die?” Waipu replied: “He shall die.” “What fault have you to cause his death?” asked Kaiuli. “There is a fault. When he becomes king of Maui, and the bundles of kapued kapas and loin cloth are brought out, I will get the covering for my kapa and the binding will be my loin cloth. Therefore he shall die.” Kaiuli then asked him: “By what means shall he be killed?” “By the use of the awa,” replied Waipu, “for he is very fond of awa.” The preparations of the awa were then commenced. The calabashes were filled, the water gourds were filled, the fish calabashes were filled, and when all the awa was prepared Kaiuli asked of Waipu: “Who will go and bring Pamano?” “I will,” said Waipu."
"Maanei e kamailio iki kakou no Pamano, no kana hana mahope o ko Koolau pii ana e hai ia Kaiuli ma.",We will here speak of Pamano and what he did after Koolau came up to inform Kaiuli of what he had done.
"A hala o Koolau i uka, ala ae la o Pamano hopu i ka papa, a iho i ka heenalu i kai o Mokulau. I laila ia i heenalu ai a kaha ka la makai, kokoke e hoi i uka.

Ia ia e hee ana i ka nalu, oli mai la:","After Koolau left for the uplands, Pamano rose, took up his surf board and started down to the beach to enjoy the surf. He continued surfing until the sun passed the meridian, and while he was about to take his last surf and return ashore, Waipu arrived on the beach and called out: “Say, Pamano, come home and drink your favorite drink, the awa, while it is yet warm; and eat of the food prepared before it gets cold.” Pamano was startled by the call, but when he looked about he saw that it was his uncle. At sight of him he had a premonition of coming disaster and death; he was, however, at this time riding on the outside edge of a surf and his skin was entirely dry, and so he chanted these words:"
"Ka makani lau awa o Hana, Ku a lanakila ka pae hala, I ke kai o Nanualele la, Kuu oili ke lele wale nei. [ ]","The awa leaf wind of Hana As it sweeps unconquered by the line of hala trees, By the sea of Nanualele For my heart throbs with strong emotions. [ ]"
"Pane aku o Waipu: “Hoi mai e inu i ko puni o ka awa, koekoe mai auanei.”","Waipu replied: “Come home and drink your favorite drink, the awa, or else it will get cold.”"
"Pau ka holo ana a Pamano i ka lala, hoi i ka hua. Oli hou mai la o Pamano:","Pamano ceased riding the body of the surf and skimmed along in the foam and he again chanted, saying:"
"Kuu makuakane mai ka la hee nalu o Poloa, Mai ke koena ahiahi o Papio huli e! E huli mai! eia au la haalele ia ko la huhu, Me ko la inaina, e ike kaua!","My uncle from the surf-riding time of Poloa, From the twilight of Papio, turn, Turn to me, for here I am; forget your day of anger, Your day of passion; let us be friends."
"I mai o Waipu: “Aole paha ka’u he huakai make, i kii mai nei paha au ia oe, e hoi e inu i ko puni o ka awa.” Pae o Pamano, auau i ka wai, hume ae la no i ka malo wai, kaha aku la no pii. A hiki laua i luna o Mahinui, he oioina ia, e huli la nana ia Mokulau. Ku o Pamano a nana i kai, i ke aiai mai o ke one o Huleia, oli aku la ia:","Waipu replied: “Your journey is perhaps not of death. I have come for you to go and drink your favorite awa.” Pamano then came ashore, bathed himself in fresh water, again girded on his wet loin cloth and started on up. When the two arrived on the heights of Mahinui, a high knoll, overlooking Mokulau, Pamano stood and looked toward the sea, and when he saw the white sands shining there at Huleia, he chanted the following words:"
"A luna au o Mahinui, Nana kuu maka i kai, Me he kapa kea la i hola ia la, Ke one i kai o Huleia, I lawe hoi au i hula, I makana olelo hoi na iala.","As I stand on the heights of Mahinui, And my eyes gaze seaward, Like a white cloth that is spread out, Is the sand there below at Huleia. I have taken it up as a song A gift of words for her."
"Kaha aku la laua nei pii, oli ana na kaikuahine unihipili, o Nakinowailua, o Hokiolele:","The two after this continued on up, when the spirit sisters of Pamano, Nakinowailua and Hokiolele were heard chanting as follows:"
"Kupono mau ka la i ke kua o Mahiki, Aia ma ke kaha o Kualakaina, I alakai ’na oe i ke ahupuaa, Ua hue oe au e hoole nei, Paa ka ole i ko waha nau ia .","The sun always comes up from the back of Mahiki, At the shores of Kualakaina. You are being led to the ahupuaa, For you have stolen, although you pretend to be innocent; No is fastened to your lips, that is for you."
"Huli ae o Pamano a olelo aku: “U! no’u paha ka pii a ola mai au, make olua ia’u.” Kaha aku la laua nei pii a hiki i ka hale, nana aku o Pamano i ke ano o ka hale a me kanaka. Aole e like me ke ano mua, nolaila, oli aku la ia:","At this Pamano turned and said: “Yes, here I am going up and if I return alive, I will kill both of you. ” From this place the two continued on up until they arrived at the house. Pamano then looked at the house and saw that it looked as though deserted, no one being around; it appeared different from what it used to be, so he chanted as follows:"
"Kukulu ka pahu niu a ke alina ka maewaewa. He pihe aha ko luna nei e wa nei la? He pihe make, hikii mai na lima paa i ke kua, Kuu pokii e! Kuu pokii!","The coconut pole is erected, though scarred and cut up, For there is a gathering here, the voices are heard; It is the gathering of death; the hands are fastened at the back. My younger brother, O my younger brother!"
"“Komo mai, e inu i ko puni o ka awa.” Komo aku la keia, aole wahi maloo o ka hale, ua hookele ia i ka wai a kele. Komo aku la keia a noho. Inu i ka awa, lawe na kaikuahine i ka ona, ono i ka wai.

[ ]","He was then called: “Come in and take your favorite drink, the awa.” He entered the house and saw that there was not a single dry spot in the house; all was drenched with water. He entered, however, sat down, then took up the containers and [ ] drank the awa, while his sisters took away its intoxicating power. When he became thirsty, he took up the water gourds, but they contained awa. He became hungry and opened the calabashes for food and fish, but they contained awa. The sisters kept on taking the intoxicating portions of the awa until they were unable to take any more; and they became wearied, and so Pamano at last became intoxicated and in time was completely overcome. Pamano then rolled himself up in a cloak and laid down, and from the inside of the cloak he looked out watching to see what was to be done to him."
"A ike o Waipu ua ona o Pamano i ka awa, lalau aku la ia i ke koi a hoa. (Ke ano o ia, he hikii i ka koi me ka laau i hana au kekee ia me ke kaula i hilo ia e like me ke aho.)",When Waipu saw that Pamano was under the influence of the awa he reached for the stone axe and began to bind on the handle with cords.
"O keia koi a Waipu e hoa nei, he koi ooki no Pamano. Ia Waipu e hoa ana i ke koi, kau mai o Pamano i ke oli:","This axe that Waipu was binding together was for the purpose of cutting Pamano and killing him. While Waipu was binding the handle to the axe, Pamano chanted these words:"
"Aala kupukupu ka uka o Kanehoa la! Hoa!

Bind on, the hands of the waikoloa wind are binding, The waikoloa wind is the cold wind of Lihue, Withering the branches in the uplands of Waiopua, My flower I said I would string into garlands. If you have it, You would have worn it."
"Ia wa ooki o Waipu i ke koi ia Pamano, aohe moku, no ka mea, ua hoohuli ia ka oi o ke koi e ka mana o na kaikuahine unihipili. Oia o Nakinowailua, o Hokiolele. Oli hou a Pamano:","Waipu then stood up and began to chop Pamano with the axe, but try as he would he was unable to cut him, for his spirit-sisters Nakinowailua and Hokiolele had dulled the edge of the axe. Pamano then chanted:"
"Ka pilipili ula i ka la, I ula i ke aloha, Homai ka ihu a hele ae au.","The pilipili is made red by the sun, Made red by love. Give me a kiss ere I go."
"O keia oli a Pamano, e nonoi aku ana i ka ihu o Koolau a me Waipu e honi. No ka mea, ua manao na kaikuahine e lawe i ke ola o Pamano, o ino ke kino ke loihi ke ola ana, o weluwelu i ke koi a Waipu.","This chant of Pamano’s was a request to Koolau and Waipu to kiss him before he died, for his sisters were going to take his life with them, for fear that their brother’s body would get disfigured, for they knew that the axe of Waipu would in time do its work and Pamano would be cut into pieces."
"A make o Pamano, lawe ia aku la e kanu ia i ka puu ainako, a kiai ia e na kanaka [ ] i ka po ana iho. O na kaikuahine o Pamano, oia o Nakinowailua, o Hokiolele.

Hookuu ia ka uhane ino maluna o ke Kaula, lilo i pupule.","After Pamano was dead he was carried off to be buried in a pile of sugar-cane [ ] trash, and that night the place was guarded by watchmen. In the meantime the spirit sisters of Pamano, Nakinowailua and Hokiolele consulted together to go and get the body of their brother and remove it from the place in which it was buried. That night they proceeded to carry out their intention, but in coming to the place they found that it was being guarded, and that the guards were all awake. When they saw this, Nakinowailua showed herself in a form plainly seen by the people, whereat the watchers, in fear, all deserted the place and ran to the house. The two sisters then took up the body and departed from the place. After they had arrived at a secluded spot they worked upon the dead body of Pamano and in time brought it to life again; completely restoring him to his former self. Shortly after this Pamano proceeded on a tour of sightseeing. In their travels in other lands, Pamano and his sisters, met a prophet who said that Pamano possessed the body of a ghost. And because of a violent dispute between the prophet and some of the people he procured an ape leaf and spread it out on the roadway and said to the people: “If after I spread the ape leaf on the road and he should step on it and does not tear it then the body is that of a ghost; but if it tears, then he has a human body.” In all this Pamano was aware of the test. After spreading out the ape leaf the prophet said to the people: “Now watch him.” Pamano upon coming to the ape leaf stepped on it and rubbed it with his feet tearing the leaf. When the people saw that the ape leaf was torn, they turned to the prophet and told him that he was trying to deceive them. After this the prophet followed Pamano. When the sisters of Pamano saw that the prophet was following their brother, they allowed an evil spirit to enter the prophet and he became a mad man."
"Aia hoi, he po kilu no laua, malaila e akoakoa ai na mea a pau, e nana i ke kilu ana a na ’lii. A kokoke mai ka po e kilu ai, hiki aku la o Pamano me na kanaka i kahi kilu.

Hui o Pamano me ka wahine me Keaka. [ ]","Some time after this the two were to have a kilu night; so people from all parts began to come to the royal dancing hall to witness the kilu games of the chiefs. Upon the approach of the night when the kilu was to take place, Pamano and several others came to the dancing hall. Pamano on getting into the hall went and sat within the cloak of a man who had on a very large cloak or wrapper, and there he hid himself. When the time for the commencement of the game approached Keaka came out and chanted the very meles composed and sung by Pamano. Then followed a recess. Pamano after awhile chanted from within his hiding place, the chants recited by him to Koolau while he and Keaka were in the house. While Pamano was chanting, Keaka began to make a search for the chanter, weeping at the same time, for she was aware that none knew these chants save Pamano and herself. After a time she found him. Pamano then said to her: “I will never be your husband as long as Kaiuli, Waipu and Koolau are alive. After they are dead I will live with you.” When Keaka heard this she ordered some men to start an oven; and after it was heated, the three, Kaiuli, Waipu and Koolau were all killed and put into the oven. After this Pamano took Keaka to be his wife. [ ]"
"Elua ona ano, he kanaka, he puaa. O Kaliuwaa kona wahi noho i Kaluanui, ma Koolauloa. O Olopana ke ’lii o ia wa, e noho ana ma Oahu nei.

Kahea mai o Kamaunuaniho ke kupunawahine, ma ka inoa o Kamapuaa:","Kamapuaa had two forms, that of a human being and that of a hog. His home was at Kaliuwaa, in Kaluanui, Koolauloa. Olopana was the king of Oahu at this time. It was Kamapuaa’s custom to go and steal the chickens from Olopana’s lands at Kapaka, at Punaluu, and at Kahana. In one night all the chickens in these different places would be taken. On one of these expeditions, just before daylight while on his way home he met Kawauhelemoa, a supernatural being who had the form of a chicken, who enticed him on until he was discovered by the guards of Olopana. When Olopana heard that it was Kamapuaa that was robbing the hen roosts he sent word to all the people from Kahana to Kaluanui to go after Kamapuaa and bring him on their backs to his presence. The people who were sent on this mission numbered about eight hundred. When they came to Kamapuaa, they took him and bound him with ropes, then placed him on a pole and carried him to Punaluu. When his grandmother, Kamaunuaniho, saw this, she called out in a chant composed in honor of Kamapuaa, as follows:"
"He miki, he miki, A i hanau mai oe e Hina, Ka maka o ka puaa, E lele ana i ke lani, E lele ana i ke kuahiwi, Ewalu maka o ke keiki puaa a Hina, Na Hina oe, [ ] Na Kahikiula, Na Kahikilei, O Lonoiki oe, O Lono nui oe, O kuu maka, o kuu aloha, e Lono e, Haina a moe i kuahu a Olopana; A ko kakou alii, Kou inoa, e o mai.","Be on the watch, be on the watch When you give birth, O Hina, The eyes of the hog, They glance to the heaven, And glance to the mountain. The son of Hina is a hog with eight eyes. By Hina art thou, [ ] By Kahikiula, By Kahikilei. Thou art Lonoiki, Thou art Lononui. My eyes, my love, O Lono. Follow until thou liest on the altar of Olopana, The altar of our king. This is your name, make answer."
"Ia wa nu o Kamapuaa i luna o ka auamo, hiki aku la lakou i Kahana, iho iho la na niho o Kamapuaa ma o a maanei, pau loa na kanaka. A koe o Makalii, i ahai lono e lohe ai o Olopana.

Kahea hou o Kamaunuaniho, i ka inoa o Kamapuaa:","At the close of the chant Kamapuaa grunted [like a hog] although he was still on the back of the men. When the company arrived at Kahana, the tusks of Kamapuaa went down on either side and the whole company of men were killed, with the exception of Makalii, who was spared to carry the tidings to Olopana. This fellow ran to the presence of Olopana and told him how all the men had been destroyed excepting himself. Olopana then ordered the men from Kahana to the point of Kaoio, numbering about twelve hundred, to get ready to go and make war on Kamapuaa. When these men came to Kamapuaa he was again bound and placed on sticks and carried [to Olopana]. When Kamaunuaniho saw this she again chanted the name of Kamapuaa, saying:"
"O Hiwahiwa oe.

The hog bodies of Kama in the bush. Thou art Haunuu, Haulani, Kaalokuloku, The shark, the large fish. Make a move, it is your name, respond."
"Ia wa, hu ua puaa nei i luna o ka manele, a pau iho la kaula i ka hemohemo. Ka ai aku la no ia i na kanaka a pau loa, a koe no o Makalii.

He then started and ate up all the men, with the exception of Makalii. Makalii then ran until he met Olopana and told him what the hog had done. When Olopana heard this he ordered all the people from Kaluanui to Kahuku to go and bring Kamapuaa to his presence. When the people came to Kamapuaa, they took him and bound him with ropes, put him on the packing sticks and proceeded on their way to Punaluu."
Mele hou o Kamaunuaniho ke kupunawahine o Kamapuaa:,"When the grandmother of Kamapuaa, Kamaunuaniho, saw this she chanted as follows:"
"O Kanaiahuea oe, O ke ’kua maka oioi, Nana ka maka i ka lani, E kilo ana i ka moku nei, I ka hiki ua lani, Ka puu e lono i ka haiuiu, O Hiiaka oe i Puuokapolei, Ke ’kua oe o Haia, O Haia oe, kou inoa ia e o mai.","Thou art Kanaiahuea, The god with the piercing eyes, The eyes that look to heaven, Watching over the island here, For the appearance of the rain from heaven, The place of hearing, way up above.

"Ala hou o Kamapuaa, a ai i na kanaka, a koe no o Makalii. Holo aku la ia a hiki i mua o Olopana, hai aku la i keia mau mea a pau loa. Kena hou o Olopana i na kanaka mai Kahuku a Keahuopuaa.

Upon hearing this Olopana again ordered all the men from Kahuku to Keahuopuaa, to go for Kamapuaa. When the men came up to Kamapuaa, they did the same as the others had done, tied him up and carried him this time as far as Kapaka, when Kamaunuaniho again chanted forth:"
"Na Mumu ka lani, Na Muahaaha, Na ilo eu, Na Niniole, Na ka hua nui, O ke lono i ke ao, Na ka mana o ka puaa, Na kui, na nau, Na wali, na oka, [ ] Na Haapekupeku.

The tidings came by day, By the powers of the hog, By its tusks were they chewed, Made soft and fine [ ] By Haapekupeku. The hog that roots up the land, Standing on the island of Kauai, On Oahu, making him appear as two. That is your name, make answer."
"A pau keia mele ana o Kamaunuaniho, ai hou o Kamapuaa e like me mamua i na kanaka a pau loa, a koe no o Makalii. Hele aku la ia a lohe o Olopana i keia mau mea a Kamapuaa. Alaila, kuahaua ae la ia i na kanaka a pau loa o Oahu nei. Na ’lii malalo ona, na koa, na makaainana, aohe kanaka e noho. Hele me ka makaukau, no ke kaua. Ka pololu, ka elau, ka ihe, ka newa, ka nihomano, ka pahoa, ka ahuula, ka mahiole, na mea make a pau loa.","At the close of this chanting by Kamaunuaniho, Kamapuaa again destroyed all the men, with the exception of Makalii, who again ran to Olopana and reported to him all the things which Kamapuaa had done to them. At this, Olopana ordered all the men of the whole island of Oahu, the chiefs under him, the warriors, the common people, no one to remain behind, all were ordered to be armed for the battle, with their long spears, short spears, darts, clubs, shark’s teeth and wooden daggers; all to be dressed in their feather cloaks and feather helmets and go and make war on Kamapuaa."
"Ia Olopana e hoomakaukau ana i keia mau mea, hiki mua aku la ka lohe ia Kamapuaa ma Kaluanui. Nolaila, makaukau e iho la ia mamua o ko Olopana hiki ana.","While Olopana was making his preparations, word was carried ahead to Kamapuaa at Kaluanui. Upon hearing this Kamapuaa also made his preparations, and before the arrival of Olopana he was ready."
"He pali kiekie loa o Kaliuwaa ke nana aku, he pali hiki ole ke pii aku i luna, a ke iho mai i lalo, aohe alanui e hiki ai, a he pali loihi no hoi ke nana aku, elua hapakolu o ka mile paha kona kiekie mai ka honua o lalo a hiki i ka welau o luna. A ma ia pali nihinihi o Kamapuaa i moe ai mai lalo ae a luna, i alanui e pakele ai na makua, na kaikuaana, ke kupunawahine, na ohua a me na ukana o lakou.","Kaliuwaa is a very high cliff to look at. It is a cliff impossible to climb up, or to come down; there is no way up or down this cliff and it is very high, being about two-thirds of a mile in height from its base to the highest point; but it was against this cliff that Kamapuaa leaned to provide a way of escape for his parents, as also his older brothers, his grandmother and their servants with all their things."
"A pau loa na mea a pau i ka hiki i luna o ka pali o Kaliuwaa. Koe iho la o Kamaunuaniho, ke kupunawahine i lalo, no ka mea, ua hookae ia i ka pii maluna o ka moopuna o Kamapuaa. Nolaila, huli ae la ke alo o Kamapuaa i luna, a ma ka waiu kona pii ana a hiki i luna o Kaliuwaa. Pela i hiki ai o Kamaunuaniho i luna a pakele i ka make a Olopana.","After everybody had reached the top of the cliff of Kaliuwaa, there was left behind Kamaunuaniho, the grandmother, for she disliked to climb up the back of her grandson, Kamapuaa; therefore he turned his back to the cliff and the grandmother climbed up along the teats of Kamapuaa until she reached the top of Kaliuwaa. In this way Kamaunuaniho got to the top of the cliff and was saved from the wrath of Olopana."
"A hiki o Olopana me kona poe kanaka ma Kaluanui, aohe o Kamapuaa. Nolaila, huli mai la o Olopana ma na pali Koolau a hiki i Kailua. A malaila ae a Maunalua, a Wailupe, a Waikiki, a Ewa, a Waianae, noho iho la o Olopana i laila, no ka mea, aia i laila o Kamapuaa. Hele mai la o Kamapuaa a Wahiawa noho i laila, mahiai.","When Olopana and his men arrived at Kaluanui, Kamapuaa was not to be found. Olopana then came searching for him along the cliffs of Koolau until he arrived at Kailua; and from this place to Maunalua, Wailupe, Waikiki, Ewa, and Waianae, where Olopana stayed , for Kamapuaa was living at this place. After getting to the top of the cliff, Kamapuaa had come to Wahiawa and at this place he started farming."
"O Olopana hoi a me na kanaka ma Waianae kahi i noho ai. Ma keia noho ana a Olopana, aole hiki ia ia ke kii ia Kamapuaa no ke kahuna ole nana e hoakaka mai iaia i ka pono o ke kii ana a me ka lanakila maluna o Kamapuaa.

A no kekahi hewa i loaa ia Lonoaohi i mua o Olopana, nolaila, ua pau kona noho kahuna ana. [ ]","Olopana and his men settled at Waianae. In this stay of Olopana he could not proceed to the capture of Kamapuaa, because he had no advisory priest with him to direct him, to insure a victory over Kamapuaa, for Lonoaohi, who had been his priest since he became king of Oahu, was fastened with ropes and imprisoned until his death for some transgression before him, therefore he had been removed from his position as high priest. [ ]"
"Oia ke kahuna i kii ia ai ma ke kauoha a Olopana i Kauai. I kona hiki ana i Waianae a launa me Olopana, olelo aku ia ia Olopana ma kona ano kahuna: “E kuu haku, e ke ’lii e!

O kona nawaliwali no ia, alaila, pau ka ikaika.”","Malae was [the name of] the high priest who was summoned by Olopana; he belonged to Kauai. When he arrived at Waianae and met Olopana in his capacity as priest he said to Olopana: “My lord and king, your opponent Kamapuaa has the character of a god; you will never be able to overcome him; and you will not live if you fight him in a regular battle. There is but one way for you to deal with your opponent whereby you will overcome him, and it is this: Get a pig, a piece of awa, a chicken, a fish, a man and a banana all having the word or letters lau, l-a-u; then take these things and lay them before Kamapuaa. These things if offered him as a sacrifice will remove his strength and he will become as one very weak.”"
"Ma keia olelo a Malae ke kahuna, i hooko iho ai o Olopana. A makaukau keia mau mea, pii aku la ia me na kanaka a loaa o Kamapuaa, hahau aku la o Olopana i na mea a ke kahuna i olelo ai. Mahope o ka hahau ana a Olopana, nawaliwali loa o Kamapuaa a palupalu loa iho la. Ia wa, alako ia o Kamapuaa e na kanaka a hiki i Pahoa (he aina iai ma Waianae a hiki i keia la). Ilaila, maluhiluhi o Olopana a haalele ia Kamapuaa, a hoi aku la i ka hale. Koe iho la o na kanaka e kauo ana ia Kamapuaa.","Olopana then followed out the instructions of Malae and prepared all the different things ordered by the priest. After the things were ready Olopana and his men proceeded to the place where Kamapuaa was living. When Olopana found Kamapuaa the things were laid at the feet of Kamapuaa as directed by the priest. Upon doing this it was seen that the strength of Kamapuaa left him and he became weak and feeble. The men then took hold of Kamapuaa and dragged him to Pahoa, a place in Waianae, and it is known by this name to this day. When they arrived at this place Olopana became very tired from the excitement and hard work and returned to his house, leaving his men to bring Kamapuaa along."
Ua paa o Lonoaohi i ka pou a manu. (He pou no i waena o ka hale.) Ua paa hoi ko Olopana manao e kau pu me Kamapuaa i luna o ka heiau.,Lonoaohi was bound and fastened to a post in the center of a certain house. Before this Olopana had expressed his intention to sacrifice him with Kamapuaa on the altar of the temple.
"Ua ike o Lonoaohi ma kona aoao kahuna, i ko na kanaka manao e hana aku ai ia Kamapuaa, oia keia. I ka hiki ana o na kanaka a me Kamapuaa i Pahoa, hele aku la na kanaka e imi i pahoa, i mea kaha i ka opu o ka puaa, i pau ka naau a me ka loko, alaila mama ke amo ia Kamapuaa.

Ina ola ia, ola kakou, ina make ia, make kakou.”","Being gifted with all the power to tell the future and so on, the high priest Lonoaohi was able to know the intention of the men who had Kamapuaa in charge, which was this: When the men and Kamapuaa arrived at Pahoa [and Olopana had departed for home], the men sought instruments with which to cut the pig [Kamapuaa] open, and let the insides be taken out so as to make the carrying much easier. Lonoaohi knew that if Kamapuaa was killed he would be killed also. He therefore directed his sons, Kapuaaolomea and Kapuaahiwa, to go to the assistance of Kamapuaa, saying: “You two go to the men and tell them that the king has sent word by you not to cut the hog open. Let it be as it is till reaching the altar, or the king’s victim will be spoiled. There will be all the rest of this day and night until tomorrow; by that time the sacrifice of the king will surely get spoiled. Furthermore, the king has said, that the hog must not be dragged, for his skin will get cut and injured. It must be carried on the sticks and [ ] when the men get tired put the hog on the ground that the men may rest. Tell them that this is the wish of the king. This will be the only way of saving your master. If he lives we will all live; but if he dies we will all die.”"
"A hiki laua i mua o na kanaka ma Pahoa, e hookala ana na pahoa, e makaukau ana e kaha i ka opu o Kamapuaa. Hai aku la laua i na olelo a Lonoaohi i na kanaka a pau loa, a lohe lakou, haalele i na pahoa. (Nolaila, ka inoa o ia aina a hiki i keia la o Pahoa.) Lawe maikai ia aku la o Kamapuaa a hiki i ka heiau e kau ai.","When the two came up to the men at Pahoa, they found them sharpening their wooden daggers and getting ready to cut Kamapuaa open. The sons of Lonoaohi then spoke to the men using the words told them by their father. When the men heard this they gave up their daggers. It was because of this fact that this place was called Pahoa and it is so known to this day. The men therefore carefully carried Kamapuaa and placed him in the temple."
"Ia po ana iho, moe iho la o Lonoaohi ma kona wahi me na keiki, me ka paa o waho i ke kiai ia. O Kamapuaa hoi me kona kiai ia.

No ka mea, a ao ae kau laua i ka lele me Kamapuaa.","That night Lonoaohi slept at the post to which he was tied, his sons with him, while the guards kept watch around the house; and Kamapuaa slept in the temple, with his guards. Late that night when the Milky Way could be plainly seen, Lonoaohi was awakened by his god. Lonoaohi then on bended knees invoked his divine help and at the close of his prayer the ropes which held him fell from his body and he rose and walked out of the house, where he found the guards all asleep. When he arrived at the place where Kamapuaa was held bound, he found that his guards had also fallen asleep and no one was watching. Lonoaohi then placed his hand along the nostrils of Kamapuaa and found that he was still breathing; he was not dead. Lonoaohi then said: “Saved. I thought that you were dead, but I see that you are not. These bones will now be cared for.” After a while he again said to Kamapuaa: “Say, I want the wai lands of Oahu.” Kamapuaa answered: “Hu.” The meaning of the request was this: that Lonoaohi was to get the lands containing the word or letters w-a-i, such as, Waianae, Waialua and so on. Lonoaohi was aware, through his great powers, that Olopana was to be killed in the contest that was yet to come, and that Kamapuaa would come in possession of Oahu. This was the reason he made this request. After this meeting between Lonoaohi and Kamapuaa, the priest returned to his place and sat down and for the rest of the night confined himself to praying to his god, for at daylight the next morning he was to be placed on the altar with Kamapuaa."
"A olowalu ka moa o ke kakahiaka nui, hele mai la o Olopana me ka kahuna o Malae, e kai ka aha a maikai, no ke kau ana o ke kanaka i ka lele ke ao ae.

Kahea aku o Kamapuaa i ke kahuna ia Lonoaohi : [ ]","When the crowing of the cocks became general, that early morning, Olopana and the priest Malae came to begin the ceremonies generally performed before human sacrifices were to be offered; this was, to prepare for the offering of the two prisoners. While the two were approaching the steps leading to the altar, Kamapuaa was unwound and placed on the anuu. Behold he was above Olopana and the priest. At this particular time, as the two were facing each other, both naked, reciting the prayer, and while in the midst of it, Kamapuaa opened his eyes wide, when he was seen by Malae and Olopana, standing above them. At sight of him they became possessed of a great fear, so much so that they could not run. Kamapuaa then, while on the platform, prayed, invoking his several supernatural bodies and all his gods to come to his aid. At the close of the prayer the outside of the temple was filled with the gods and hogs. Kamapuaa then called out to the priest, Lonoaohi, saying: [ ]"
"Ia wa, oili ae la o Lonoaohi a waho kukulu i ka lepa. O ka poe i komo maloko o ka lepa, pakele i ka make. Mahope o laila, aohe ahailono hookahi i pakele aku ia Kamapuaa, o Makalii. No kona komo ana maloko o na uha o Kamaunuaniho. Pela ka make ana o Olopana ia Kamapuaa, a pela no hoi i lilo ai o Oahu nei ia Kamapuaa.","At this call Lonoaohi came out of the house where he was held, and stood up a flag; a sign that those who came under its protection would be saved from death. Shortly after this the slaughter began and everybody was killed by Kamapuaa, excepting Makalii, who ran and got in between the legs of Kamaunuaniho. This was how Olopana was killed by Kamapuaa, and how Oahu came into his possession."
"O Kahiki ka aina o Lonokaeho, ke ’lii ma kekahi aoao, a o Kowea ma kekahi aoao. He mau alii paonioni laua o ka noho ana, he kaua ma waena o laua i na la a pau loa.

Aole i ala ka hiamoe, kahea iho o Kamapuaa:","Kahiki was the land in which Lonokaeho lived, and he was king of one side of the island while Kowea was the king on the other. These two kings were at war with each other all the time and battles were fought every day. Kowea was the father-in-law of Kamapuaa, for Kamapuaa, upon his arrival in Kahiki, took the daughters of Kowea to be his wives. One day Kamapuaa said to Kowea: “I am going to meet Lonokaeho in battle and I want you to watch the fire when it is lit. If the smoke rises and leans toward the sea, I have killed Lonokaeho; but if the smoke should lean toward the upland, then I have been killed by him.” That night Kamapuaa slept till daylight the next morning, when he arose and proceeded to the place where Lonokaeho was living. He arrived before Lonokaeho was up, so he called out:"
"E moe e Kahiki e! E moe e Kahiki e! E moe e Kahiki e!

"A lohe o Lonokaeho i keia leo o Kamapuaa, olelo mai la ia: “Ia oe ka haawi o ko’u aina e na kanaka? Nohea oe?

Why don’t you come and meet me face to face and then let us fight? If I am killed then my land shall be taken away [ ] from me.” Kamapuaa consented to this, saying: “Yes.” Kamapuaa then approached nearer to Lonokaeho and when he was up to him, Lonokaeho showed Kamapuaa his method of attack."

Penei:","Lonokaeho had eight foreheads which were very sharp and could come down like so many axes. These foreheads were up in the heaven called Kuanuenue and Leleianaha. Lonokaeho had entertained the idea that at sight of his foreheads Kamapuaa would be frightened away, but instead of showing fear Kamapuaa called out to his gods by their names, as follows:"

[ ]","When Kamapuaa ceased calling for his gods, he and Lonokaeho began a hand to hand fight. Lonokaeho then let his eight foreheads fall on Kamapuaa, thinking they would chop him to death. When Kamapuaa saw the foreheads coming down to strike him, he called out to his gods, Kuliaikekaua and others, to turn the foreheads of Lonokaeho [from him] and let them strike on the lava rocks, which call was obeyed and the foreheads came down on the lava rocks where they kept striking until they were made dull; furthermore, after a time the foreheads were unable to get up again to resume their former place, because they were held down by the power of Kuliaikekaua and the others. At this time Kamapuaa requested of his supernatural bodies to grow over the foreheads of Lonokaeho, and at once the puaakukui , puaauhaloa and puaamaumau , began to grow all over the eight foreheads, thus removing all the power and strength from Lonokaeho. After this the two fought with their human forms, until Kamapuaa requested of his hog forms to eat up Lonokaeho and all his men. In this way was Lonokaeho killed by Kamapuaa. [ ]"
"Haalele o Kamapuaa i ka aina me kona makuahunowai me Kowea, hele aku la ia a loaa o Kuilioloa.","After the conquest of Kahiki by Kamapuaa, he left his father-in-law, Kowea, in charge of the country, while he went on his way to meet Kuilioloa."
"No Kuilioloa. He ilio ia, he ano kanaka a he ano akua. He kupu a he koa no hoi no kona aina, aohe mea pakele ia ia i ka make.",Kuilioloa was a dog which had a human body and had also supernatural powers. He was a great soldier and a famous warrior. He was the strongest man in his country and no one was found who would face him.

Because of their fear they requested of Kamapuaa to kill their husband and in that way free them from him; and for this service the two were willing to become the wives of Kamapuaa should he succeed in killing Kuilioloa."

When Kamapuaa saw the features of Kuilioloa, he chanted the following mele:"
"Kunahihi e— Kunahihi. Ano huhu e, Ano huhu. Helu ka manea, Wili ka huelo, Aa ka maka, Keke hoi ka niho, Aneane nanahu mai, Moku au la, Moku au la.

The hogs then entered the mouth of Kuilioloa and ate his inwards until he was killed."

When Kamapuaa arrived at Kilauea he went and stood on a point of land called Akanikolea, looking down into the pit, a place kapued by Pele for her own use. It was on this point [ ] that Kamapuaa made his stand and looked down into the pit, where he saw the Hiiakas. They were Hiiaka, Hiiakaikapuaaneane and Hiiakaikapoliopele, the sisters of Pele, sitting there below on the floor of the pit of Kilauea stringing leis. When Kamapuaa saw them, he chanted these words:"
"A ka luna i Puuonioni, Noho ke anaina a ka wahine, I ka luna o Wahinekapu, He oioina Kilauea, He noho ana o Papalauahi, Ke lauahi wale la no o Pele ia Puna.

She knew all the time that it was Kamapuaa that was chanting up there on Akanikolea. Kamapuaa after a pause chanted again:"
"Mai Puna hoi au i hele mai nei, Ua ike mai nei hoi au i na wahine kohi noni, Wauwau noni, Pakuikui noni, Kakau noni, O Kapunaiki kanaka loa, Ka loa o kanaka, i ka hele ana, Make i ka oopa, I ka maloeloe, E ala, aloha e!","It is from Puna that I have come And I have seen the women gathering noni, Scratching noni , Pounding noni, Marking with noni, Kapunaiki the long man, It was a long way for him to travel, He was lame, He was stiff.

The real meaning being that Pele had red eyes. This was the real meaning of the chant of Kamapuaa.
"I aku o Kamapuaa i na ’kua: “Ea! ua ike ia mai la paha wau, ke olelo mai la, he puaa ka wau.” Olelo mai na akua: “Oli ia aku.”","After this chant Kamapuaa asked of his gods: “Say, didn’t she recognize me, for she said that I was a hog?” The gods replied: “Chant again.” Kamapuaa then chanted:"

Take a look at him, for you can tell on sight whether it is a big man, a small man, a long man, a short man, a good man or a sinful man.” Pele made reply: “That hog that you are mistaking for a man is not a man; that is Kamapuaa the hog grandson of Kamaunuaniho, the son of Kahikiula and Hina.” The sisters again said: “That handsome man standing there on Akanikolea, that you say is a hog? You are an adept in lying. We have seen hogs in the lowlands of Puna, having the body of a hog, feet of a hog, head of a hog, eyes of a hog, ears of a hog, snout of a hog and everything else that belongs to a hog; but nothing like that fellow with a human form standing there.” Pele replied: “That is a hog; that is not a human being which you see standing there on Akanikolea.”"

A ike o Kamapuaa i ke ahi a Pele e a mai ana, oli aku la ia penei:","With this chant of Kamapuaa Pele became furious and she ordered her sisters and brothers to start the fire. Pele next ordered her brothers that one of them climb above Kamapuaa, the one called Hiiakaluna and the other, Hiiakalalo, to get under Kamapuaa. When the two were getting near Kamapuaa, in obedience to the command of Pele, Kamapuaa asked of his gods: “Who are these, coming?” “They are the brothers of Pele, Hiiakaluna and Hiiakalalo. If they ever come together we will be killed.” Upon hearing this reply from the gods, Kamapuaa sent his love making god, Lonoikiaweawealoha, to go and make love with the brothers of Pele. When this god met the brothers of Pele he cunningly made love to them and they immediately forgot the [ ] orders of Pele. The two proceeded to the lowlands of Puna, in Malamanui, and lived there. When the brothers decided to do this Pele was aware of their action, so she ordered Lonomakua to start the fire. When Kamapuaa saw the fire burning, he chanted these words:"
"O ke ahi a Lonomakua la, A ka wahine a Pele, Ke a ala i uka o Puna, I ka hau aiai o Maunakea, I ka uwahi po i ka lani, A ka wahine leo nui i Pohakea, Ke halawai la me ka lani, He akua kino lau, Kino pahaohao, O Lono ka maka, Owau la ke kino, Ke kii mai nei Hawaii ia’u, I ke kaula waimaka nui, Hiolo ka lae o ka pohaku, Io io ka leo o ka ala, Kui ke koi aweaweula, Uwe ka leo o ka manu, Ka leo waimaka nui o Hilo e! Pau Kilauea i ke ahi e! Kunia aku la wela ke one, Ho’a ke ahi lele i luna, I ka ai inoino a ke ’kua wahine, Po Puna i ka ua a ka awaawa, Pakui i ka uwahi a ka lua, Hauna i ka uahi a Pele la e, Aloha ka wahine o ka lua.","The fire by Lonomakua Of the woman, Pele. It is burning in the uplands of Puna, By the white snow of Maunakea, The smoke darkens the heaven, Caused by the loud voiced woman at Pohakea. It meets there in the heaven, It is a goddess of many forms, Of changeable forms. The eyes are of Lono, Like unto me the body. Hawaii is coming for me, The prophet with many tears. The forehead of stones is falling, The sound of the round stones is heard. The axe with the red binding is striking, The cry of the birds is heard, The voice of many tears of Hilo. Kilauea is consumed by fire, The sand takes on heat, It ignites and flies upward, By the devastation of the goddess. Puna is darkened by the bitter rain, Stifling is the smoke from the pit, The strong offensive smoke of Pele. My greetings, woman of the pit."
"Olelo mai o Pele: “Ae he oiaio ia, ina oe i hele mai nei me ka maikai, alaila he maikai ko onei, nolaila, ma ka ikaika e loaa ai o Pele.” Kena ae la o Pele ia Lonomakua i ke ahi, na Hiiaka, na Kahoalii, na makuakane, na ’kua a pau loa. Lele ka pohaku i ka lani, paihi luna, owela ka la, kau ao ole ka lewa. Hele ka wela a ke alo o Kamapuaa, puni mai la kona kino i ke ahi a Pele. Aka, o Kamapuaa, ua puni oia i kona mau akua ia Kuliaikekaua. Nolaila, aohe he wela o Kamapuaa i ke ahi a Pele. Aka, ua pouli ka la i ka uwahi a ka wahine, ua nalo wale Kilauea i loko o ke ahi enaena, ua holo ka wela me ka hahana i na moku.","Pele made reply: “Yes, that would have been all right, had you come in peace, then I would have treated you peaceably; but since you have come otherwise, it is only by strength that you can get Pele.” Pele then ordered Lonomakua to keep up with the fire; she also ordered the Hiiakas, the Kahoaliis, her uncles and all the gods to keep the fire going. Molten rocks then flew up to heaven; the heaven was as though in flames; the sun looked red and the sky was cloudless. The heat from the fire reached the breast of Kamapuaa and his whole body was encompassed by the fire of Pele; but Kamapuaa was surrounded by his gods, Kuliaikekaua and others, so he was protected and was not consumed by the fire of Pele. The sun was, however, darkened by the smoke of the woman, and Kilauea was entirely lost from view through the great heat; and this heat extended to the other islands of the group."
"Nolaila, manao o Pele ua make o Kamapuaa, hoopau i ka a ana o ke ahi, a pio iho la ke ahi o Kilauea, koe iho la na momoku i lalo o Halemaumau. [ ]","Therefore Pele thought that Kamapuaa must be dead, so she caused the fire to be put out, and the fire in Kilauea ceased burning; nothing remained but a few burning spots in the bottom of Halemaumau. [ ]"
"I nana mai ko Pele hana, e ku aku ana no o Kamapuaa i luna o Akanikolea, aole i make. Kena hou o Pele e hoa ke ahi. Ia wa, kahea o Kamapuaa i ke kaikuahine ona ia Keliiomakahanaloa, he wahi ao uuku, e pii mai ana ma Kona mai. O ka hele ia a kupono i luna o Kilauea, o ka iliki iho la no ia o ka ua, piha o Kilauea a hanini, pio ke ahi a Pele. A koe i ka aunaki me ka aulima. Iho na kino puaa o Kama, piha o Kilauea. O ko Kamapuaa kino maoli. Hamana ka waha, keke na niho, komo o Halemaumau i loko o ka waha, komo o Pele me na kaikaina, na kaikunane i loko, kokoke e make o Pele ma.

Nolaila, haalele o Kamapuaa ia Halemaumau. Kena ae la o Pele ia Lonomakua, ke ahi. Hi’a iho la ke ahi a a no loko o ka aunaki, pulupulu iho la a a, hoa ia iho la a piha hou o Kilauea; pii mai la ke ahi a loaa o Kamapuaa i luna o Akanikolea.

Mahope o keia kaua ana, noho a kane, a wahine iho la laua. Iloko o ia noho ana, ua mahele ia o Hawaii no laua, penei ke ano: Ekolu ia Pele, o Puna, o Kau, o Kona, he mau aina a loa lakou. O Kohala, o Hamakua, o Hilo, no Kamapuaa ia, aohe aa o keia mau aina ekolu. Pela i pau ai ke kaua ana.","When at last Pele looked, there stood Kamapuaa on Akanikolea, still alive. Again Pele ordered that the fire be rekindled. As soon as Kamapuaa saw the fire was again burning, he called out for his sister, Keliiomakahanaloa, who came up in the form of a small cloud from the south, and when it was directly over the pit of Kilauea, a heavy rain fell which filled the pit until it overflowed, putting out the fire of Pele; and the only things that were saved were the fire making sticks. The hog forms of Kama then descended into the pit of Kilauea until the whole place was overrun with hogs. Kamapuaa then changed himself into the form of a hog, opened wide its mouth, showing its tusks, and swallowed Halemaumau, taking in Pele, her sisters and brothers, and they were kept within his stomach until Pele and the others were almost dead. But when Lonoikiawewaealoha, the fickle god, the love making and unstable god, saw this he put compassion in the heart of Kamapuaa and his gods and Pele and the others were saved, otherwise Pele would have been killed. Shortly after this, Kamapuaa left Halemaumau, whereupon Pele ordered Lonomakua to again start the fire. Lonomakua then took up the two pieces of wood and began rubbing them together and in time the fire was started and the kindling wood was put on, and after a while the pit of Kilauea was again filled. The fire came up until it reached Kamapuaa, who was standing on Akanikolea. He then called for his different supernatural bodies, such as the trees, olomea , hala , the uhaloa and amaumau , and these different things began to grow, shutting off the fire. This battle was maintained for some time, no one gaining a single advantage. After the battle had been maintained for some days Pele and Kamapuaa lived as husband and wife. During this union the two made a compact, dividing Hawaii into two parts; Pele taking three districts, Puna, Kau and Kona, the districts having the most lava rocks; while Kohala, Hamakua and Hilo went to Kamapuaa; these districts being the ones free of rocks. This ended the war between the two."
"Mahope o ke kaua ana o Kamapuaa me Pele, holo mai la ia mai Hawaii mai a Maui, a Molokai, a Oahu nei. Mai Oahu aku a pae ma Kipu, i Kauai. Halawai mai la me ia o Limaloa, e hele ana i kahi o Kaneiki, he ’lii, a he aimoku, ia ia kekahi mau ahupuaa o Kauai. O ke kumu o ko Limaloa hele ana i laila, o na kaikuahine o Kaneiki.

Ia laua e hele ana ma ke ala loa, i aku o Limaloa ia Kamapuaa: “O oe ka mea e loaa ai a’u wahine, nokamea, ua pau loa kuu waiwai ia laua, aohe nae he loaa iki.”","After the battle between Pele and Kamapuaa had been fought he sailed from Hawaii for Maui; then to Molokai and from there to Oahu. After a short stay in Oahu he continued his journey to Kauai and landed at Kipu. On his way inland he met Limaloa who was proceeding to the home of Kaneiki, a chief and ruler of one of the districts of Kauai, he having in charge several of the ahupuaas of that island. The reason of Limaloa’s visit to the home of Kaneiki was to court his two daughters. In this journey Kamapuaa had changed himself back to his human form, handsome and pleasant to look upon. Therefore Limaloa adopted him in reciprocal friendship. While on their way Limaloa said to Kamapuaa: “With your efforts I shall win the two girls as my wives, for I have given them all my possessions, but still I have not been able to win them.”"
"Ma keia hele ana, hiki aku la laua i luna o Kemamo he punawai e inu ia, ua paa [ ] nae i ka wahine ka waha i ke pani. Ninau aku o Kamapuaa i ka wai e inu, hoole mai ka wahine, aohe wai.

I aku o Kamapuaa: “E Limaloa ! O au wahine paha keia?” “Ae,” pela mai o Limaloa. Kau aku la o Kamapuaa i ke oli, penei:","On this journey the two reached Kemano, a spring of good drinking water, and [ ] there found a woman sitting over the spring covering it up. Kamapuaa asked for a chance to get a drink, but the woman refused, saying there was no water. At this Kamapuaa took up the woman and threw her over the cliff and the two then quenched their thirst. From this place they continued on until they arrived at Kilohana. Just below this place was a valley overgrown with kukui trees and in this valley two girls were gathering kukui nuts; these were the Limaloa girls. Kamapuaa said to his companion: “Say, Limaloa, are not those girls your sweethearts?” “Yes,” answered Limaloa. Kamapuaa then chanted this mele:"
"He wahi pali iki hoi o Kipu e hele ia nei, Aole i anana ia ka loa o Makuaiki, Aole hoi au i hele i ka loa, Aole hoi i hele i ka laula, He pali kui, e hono, e waha, I Mauea la e! aia i luna, Aia i luna ka leo o ke kanaka, Aia i lalo ka leo o Kaiwikui, Ke ualo la i ka pali o Mahukona.

It is a double cliff, high and lofty, To Mauea that is at the top. The voice of man is at the top, The voice of Kaiwikui is at the bottom. Where it is pleading to the cliff of Mahukona, For such is Kona. Kona the small, Kona the large. For such is man when in love, He is overcome with love, he is ill at ease, Ill at ease, as the women by the cliff, Kukuiahinahina together with Kukuiahalua. The red bosom and the white bosom, The daughters of Kaneiki, What are the two doing here? Whiling away time in the uplands, Making love. Our greetings to you two."
"I mai na wahine: “Aia hoi ke aloha a ua noho pu.” Kahea mai la na wahine ia laua nei. Iho aku la laua a hiki, noho pu iho la me na wahine. Hoouna aku la na wahine i ke kanaka, e hai aku ia Kaneiki i ko laua makemake i keia kanaka i kane na laua.","The two girls replied: “How can there be any love when we have not lived together?” The two, however, invited Kamapuaa and Limaloa to come and sit with them. Shortly after this the two girls sent a man to tell Kaneiki of their wish to make this man [Kamapuaa] their husband."
"A lohe o Kaneiki, olelo mai la i ke kanaka, e hoi oe a olelo aku i na ’lii wahine: “Ua hoohiki ke kaikunane o olua o Kamapuaa ka olua kane, aka, ina nae o Kamapuaa ia, moe ia.” Kauoha aku la o Kaneiki i ke kanaka: “E hoi oe a hiki, e alakai mai i ka hale nei e ai ai.” A hala ke kanaka, hoomakaukau iho la o Kaneiki i ka ai a me ka ia na Kamapuaa.

Mahope o laila, noho iho la lakou he mau la.","When Kaneiki heard the wish of his daughters, he said to the man: “You go back and tell the young chiefesses that their brother has made an oath that they shall marry no other husband except Kamapuaa. If, however, this man is Kamapuaa himself then they can marry him.” Continuing, Kaneiki said to the man: “You go back to where they are and bring them all here that they may partake of food.” After the man had gone on his way, Kaneiki prepared food and meat for the strangers. When Kamapuaa and Limaloa arrived, they were invited to sit down and partake of some food. Limaloa ate as any other human being, but Kamapuaa ate like a hog. After these events they lived together for several days."
"Hele o Kaneiki e kaua me Makalii, hee mai la o Kaneiki ia Makalii. Elua kaua [ ] ana me Kaneiki, hee ia Makalii. Nolaila, uwe na wahine a Kamapuaa i ka make ia Makalii. O Kamapuaa hoi, e moe ana no i ka hale, aole hele, aohe hana, o ka moe ka hana.","Kaneiki at this time was at war with Makalii and on setting out to battle one day, he was defeated. Kaneiki went forth the second time to war but he was again [ ] beaten by the forces of Makalii. At these repeated defeats of their father, the two girls of Kamapuaa wept at the prospect of their coming death by Makalii. Kamapuaa, however, did nothing but sleep in the house; he never went about anywhere, nor did any work; all he did was sleep."
"Oia no kela Makalii i holo ai mai Oahu aku nei, iloko o ke kaua a Olopana me Kamapuaa, i olelo ia ma ke kaua ana a Olopana a me Kamapuaa ma Waianae. Eia nae, ua lilo ia i alii no Kauai ia wa, a malalo mai ona na kanaka o Kauai, pela i alii ai o Makalii.","This Makalii was none other than the Makalii who escaped from Oahu and ran to Kauai, during the battle between Olopana and Kamapuaa, that took place at Waianae, as already spoken of. Upon the arrival of Makalii on Kauai, he became the king of that island and all the people of Kauai served under him."
"A ala o Kamapuaa, olelo aku na wahine: “Kupanaha oe, o ka moe no kau, a o ka makuakane o kakou mai make, o maua no hoi mai make, ina la aole oe e ike.” I aku o Kamapuaa: “Owau ke hele e kaua me Makalii, a o oukou hoi e noho, mai hele oukou.” Ae mai o Kaneiki: “Ae, o oe ke hele.” Ninau aku o Kamapuaa ia Kaneiki: “Aohe au laau nui i ike ai, a i ole, i lohe ai?” “He laau no aia ia i uka o Kahikikolo.” Kii aku la na kanaka he lehulehu, a ooki a moku, lawe mai la me ke kauo a hiki i kai.

Here you do nothing but sleep while our father and ourselves were almost slain today, and you would not have known of it.” Kamapuaa replied: “Let me go out and fight this Makalii, while you people remain at home. You must not follow me.” Kaneiki answered: “Yes, you can go.” Kamapuaa then asked of Kaneiki: “Have you seen a large stick of wood anywhere, or heard of the whereabouts of one?” Kaneiki replied: “There is a large stick, it is in the uplands of Kahikikolo.” Several men were then sent to cut and bring the log home. As soon as it was brought home, Kamapuaa took it up and went off to do battle with Makalii, while Kaneiki and Limaloa followed behind. When Kamapuaa arrived on the heights of Kahoaea, he met Ahuli, one of Makalii’s warriors. Upon meeting this man, Kamapuaa challenged him to strike. Ahuli then lifted his war club and aimed a blow at Kamapuaa, but Kamapuaa warded off the blow with the point of his log, Kahikikolo, sending the club of Ahuli flying from his hands. When Ahuli saw that he was without his club, he turned and started to run off; but Kamapuaa struck at him with his club and killed him."
"A make o Ahuli, ku ana o Kanakea, he koa no, hele mai la a hahau i kana laau i luna o Kamapuaa, e peku ae ana o Kamapuaa i ke kumu o Kahikikolo, lele ka laau i kahi e.

He came on up and struck at Kamapuaa with his war club; but before the club struck Kamapuaa, Kamapuaa warded it off with the butt end of the log, sending the club of his opponent flying from his hands. At this Kanakea ran to hide under the aalii. Kamapuaa then took up his club and struck at Kanakea, killing him on the spot."
"Mahope ona o Omaumaukioe, a me Owalawalaheekio, he mau koa akamai i ka oo ihe.

Both of these men were skillful in the art of throwing the spear. Kamapuaa challenged them saying: “Throw your spears at me.” The two then threw their spears at Kamapuaa, who dodged, both spears missing their mark. The two then started to run off and before Kamapuaa could get at them they were out of sight."
"Mahope o laua ku ana o Makalii. I aku o Kamapuaa ia Kaneiki laua o Limaloa, he kanaka holo wale keia o Makalii. I aku o Kaneiki me Limaloa: “He koa o Makalii, aole holo ana.” Olelo aku o Kamapuaa: “Holo no, i kuu mele no auanei la holo o Makalii.” Oli aku la o Kamapuaa.","After these two, Makalii came. When Kamapuaa saw him coming, he said to Kaneiki and Limaloa: “This fellow Makalii will simply run away.” Kaneiki and Limaloa replied: “Makalii is a brave soldier and will not run away.” Kamapuaa repeated: “He will run away. Just by my chant alone he will run.” Kamapuaa then chanted:"
"Nani kua ka pali, Me he mea ala i kalai ia a nihoniho, Ka pali o Kualele la e! Lele, lele paha e! [ ]","How beautiful is the face of the cliff! Looking as though hewed into ridges, The cliff of Kualele Flies, perchance it will fly. [ ]"
"Oli mai o Makalii ma ke mele, me kona hai mai ia ia he koa no Kauai, a me kona ike ole ia Kamapuaa:","Makalii then chanted back, stating that he was a warrior of Kauai and that he did not know Kamapuaa, saying:"
"O Makaliikuakawaiea au He kaha ku wau no keia aina, Ia’u o uka, ia’u o kai, Ia’u o nae, ia’u o lalo, No’u ka hele no ke koa, Hele ka oha mahope, Ka hele au a ke koa nui, O Kauai nei la e!

If I kill Kaneiki this day, I will save you.” At these words Kamapuaa was made very angry, so he chanted of the several opponents met by him in battle, at the same time giving their names."
"A lohe o Makalii i keia oli a Kamapuaa, mihi iho la ia i kona make. Maopopo iho la ia ia o Kamapuaa keia, nolaila, ninau mai la ia ia Kamapuaa ma ke oli penei:","When Makalii heard this chant by Kamapuaa, he repented within him, because of his coming fate. He was made certain now that this person was none other than Kamapuaa; so he humbly questioned Kamapuaa in a chant, saying:"
"O oe no ka na e Haunuu, E Haulani, ka mano nui, E Kaalokuloku, e ui e? O kou inoa ia? E o mai.","Are you then, Haunuu, Haulani, the great shark, Kaalokuloku, a question? Is this your name? Make answer."
"I aku o Makalii i mua o Kamapuaa: “Make, aohe wahi e ola ai, aohe uka, aohe kai, aohe nae, aohe lalo, aohe opu weuweu e pee iho ai, ua make ia oe e Kama.” I aku o Kama: “Aole oe e make, ke loaa kekahi mele o’u ia oe.” No ka huhu o Kama ke kumu o keia olelo ana i mele, no kela huaolelo a Makalii, i pane kikoi mai ai, penei: “Lea maoli kuu inoa ia oe, ina i make o Kaneiki ia’u i keia la, o oe ka’u e hoola.”","Makalii said to Kamapuaa: “Defeated, there is no way of escape; no place in the uplands, no place in the lowlands, no place toward the east, no place underneath, not even a bunch of grass for me to hide in. I am your captive, Kama.” Kama made answer : “You will not be killed if you are able to chant one of the meles in my honor.” The reason why Kama requested a mele was because he was angry at Makalii on account of the haughty expression used: “How handsomely you chant my name! If I kill Kaneiki this day, I will save you.”"
Pane aku o Makalii: “Iloko paha o ka opu o ka makuahine loaa ke mele.” Olelo aku o Kamapuaa me ka huhu: “Aole no ka e noonoo iho kou opu?”,Makalii replied: “It is when a person is still in his mother’s womb that he should know how to chant a mele.” Kamapuaa said with some heat: “Can’t you think of one?”

Hoi aku la ia me kona mau kanaka i ke kauhiwi e noho ai. [ ]","Because of this persistency, Lonoikiaweawealoha (one of Kamapuaa’s deities) took compassion on Makalii and taught him one of the chants in honor of Kamapuaa. After learning the mele, Makalii chanted it to Kamapuaa, and at the conclusion Makalii asked: “What of me?” Kamapuaa replied: “You shall not be saved because of this one mele; you must chant another one.” Makalii again chanted, giving all the meles of Kamapuaa, at the conclusion of which Makalii was spared by Kamapuaa. By this release of Makalii he requested of Kamapuaa that he be given a piece of land for himself and his people. Kamapuaa then said to him: “You must go to Kahiki and live with Koea.” Makalii replied, saying: “No, I will never live there, for I will have to cross so many seas.” “Go to Hawaii then and live with Pele.” “I will not be able to live with her.” “Go to Oahu and live with Kekeleiaiku and Kamaunuaniho.” “I will never be able to live there.” “Go up to the mountains then and live where the ti , the pala , the mau , and hapuu are plentiful.” Makalii then replied: “Yes.” He then proceeded to the mountains and there he made his home and lived with all his people.

When Kamapuaa saw his father his love for him began to well up within him and so he said to Kaneiki: “There is your man.” Kaneiki replied: “He is a powerful man and a great warrior.” Kamapuaa said: “If he is such a great warrior he would have retained possession of his own land, Oahu, and some one else would not have acquired it.”"

As he fell Kaneiki jumped on him to make sure of his death, but Kamapuaa spoke up: “Let me finish him, you go on forward.” Kamapuaa then said to Kahikiula: “Say, you are almost dead.” “Yes, I am almost dead; the young man struck me but once and I am laid low.” Kamapuaa again said: “You look as though you were my father and that I was your son.” Kahikiula replied: “I have no other child, but one, that is Kahikihonuakele.” Kamapuaa said to him: “Crawl from here until you meet Makalii and the others in the mountains and there make your home.”"
"A hala o Kahikiula, ku ana o Kahikihonuakele, ka mua loa o Kamapuaa ma.

At sight of the new arrival, Kamapuaa said to Limaloa: “There is your man.” Limaloa replied: “I shall be killed for he is a young man.” Kamapuaa replied: “It is because I know he is not strong is the reason why I ask that you take him.” Limaloa then stood up facing Kahikihonuakele and struck him with his club, felling him to the ground. Limaloa then jumped on his opponent to make sure that he was dead, but Kamapuaa spoke up: “Go on forward, I will finish him.” After Limaloa had departed, Kamapuaa took hold of Kahikihonuakele and worked over him until he was restored to consciousness, when Kamapuaa said to him: “You are helpless; one stroke of the young man’s club laid you low. You look as though you were my older brother, and I your younger brother.” Kahikihonuakele replied: “I have no other younger brother. My two younger brothers are dead. One was killed by Pele and the other hung himself.” Kamapuaa said to Kahikihonuakele: “Crawl from here until you find Makalii and the others.” After this Kaneiki and Limaloa returned, when Kamapuaa said to them: “There is one great conflict yet to be had; it will be against a woman, so we must therefore run away and save ourselves.” The woman spoken of by Kamapuaa was Hina, their own [ ] mother. Kaneiki and Limaloa then started to run off. The reason why Kamapuaa ordered these two to run was because he took pity on his mother, Hina."
"No ka lawe ana o Kamapuaa ia Kahikikolo i laau kaua nana, kapa ia ai kona inoa. “O ke kaikoeke laau nui a Kaneiki.”","Because Kamapuaa made use of the stick of wood called Kahikikolo as his war club, he was named “Kaneiki’s-son-in-law-with-the-great-club.”"
"A haalele o Kamapuaa i na wahine a me kona makuahunowai o Kaneiki, hele aku la ia e ike i na makua ona e noho ana ma Kalalau, nokamea, e noho alii ana o Kahikiula me Hina no Kauai a puni, a e kuu ana ka ia o Kalalau, a e noho lawaia ana o Wailinuu na laua.

Fish had been caught at Kalalau; Wailinuu was their head fisherman. When Kamapuaa was nearing his parents’ place of abode, he tarried at a woman’s home. While living there, news of plentiful fish reached him."
"A hiki o Kamapuaa ia Wailinuu, ka lawaia a na makua. Kalele iho la keia i ka moo o ka waa ia, a olelo aku la: “Na’u kekahi ia, aua no make.

If you withhold it you will be killed. Death shall be your portion today and maggots tomorrow.” Wailinuu made reply: “ You are asking for two things: the request for some fish and my death.” Kamapuaa again asked: “Give me some fish.” Wailinuu replied: “Why don’t you dive down into the sea for some.” Kamapuaa then ordered one of his companions to proceed to Hina and say: “Here comes your son. He has come for some fish for himself.” When Hina heard this from the messenger, she refused, saying: “I have no other son. One was killed by Pele, one hung himself and Kahikihonuakele is the only one that is left. I don’t know where that fellow comes from. Perhaps it is some one who has heard that we have caught a large quantity of fish and has come with deception to get him some fish.” The messenger was sent back to Hina by Kamapuaa five different times and the messenger returned empty handed to Kamapuaa as many times. Kamapuaa then came to Hina, and when she saw him she turned away her face. Kamapuaa, upon seeing this, said to Hina: “Is your back then to be the one to converse with me?” Kamapuaa then chanted to Hina as follows:"
"Nani kuu noho ana i uka o Waiahulu, Hiki ana ka pihe ia o kai nei, O ui au o ninau aku, Nawai la ka i’a o kai nei?

To Hina, to Kahikiula. All that fish shall be mine, were I to get there. Say, Hina, let me have some fish? Say, Hina, don’t be hard hearted. Kahikimauolina dwells in happiness, The sands that face the Isles. [ ] He faced about to come in search, In search of the parents. The mother was without feeling, The father was mean, The older brother was unkind. They pointed to the sea for fish. In the long feeding grounds, in the short feeding grounds. In the feeding grounds where the fish dwell, In the feeding grounds known to Hina. Say, Hina, I have come for some fish for myself. Say, Hina, don’t be unkind, for I greet you. The top of the ridge was seen to appear on Waiawaawa. It was my hog form. I thought that when I came The parents would remember. Say, Hina, don’t be hard hearted."
"I mai na wahine a Kahikihonuakele: “E Hina e, malama he keiki no keia nau.” I aku o Hina: “Aohe a’u keiki e ae o Kauai nei. Ina no he manao ko olua e haawi i ka i’a, e haawi no olua.” Ma keia olelo a Hina ia laua, haawi mai la laua la ia Kamapuaa i ka i’a. Kena ae la o Kamapuaa i na hoahele i ka i’a, e amo.","The wives of Kahikihonuakele upon hearing this chant said to Hina: “Say, Hina, perchance this is your son?” Hina made reply: “I have no other son on Kauai. If you two wish to give him some fish you may do so.” When the two girls heard this from Hina, they gave Kamapuaa some of the fish. Kamapuaa then ordered his companions to take and carry away the fish."
"Mahope o laila, oli o Kamapuaa ia Hina me ka hai pololei i kona pili ana mai ke kumu mai:",Shortly after this Kamapuaa again chanted to Hina; and in the chant he informed her of his connection from the very first.
"Ma Kona hoi au i hele mai nei, Ua ike mai nei au i ka ahui maia, I aina a kiko ia e ka manu, Ke kea mua o ka maia, I kupono i ka lau o ka maia.

I saw the bunch of bananas That was eaten and pecked by the birds; The first hand of the bunch Was directly under the leaf. In the path that leads up, Hina, In the path where one searches for the water of Kekelani; The water of Waialamihi On the heights of Kaula, That water for which I long. Say, Hina, give me some fish. Say, Hina, don’t be unkind, For it was by way of Kona that I came. I have seen the light At the bottom of a valley. Waawaaiki is foolish. The inside is rolling like a raging sea. Where is thy sympathy? I am from Kohala, For the cold wind, the Apaa is of Kohala. The mouth is covered, it is the sign of refusal. Say, Hina, give me some fish. Say, my older brother, My older brother of the cliff that is held to the bosom, The double cliff of Kaliuwaa, [ ] The cliff that fed us, the cliff where we roamed, The cliff that is carried at the back, That appears as though carried on the back when one’s back is turned toward it. O, let us weep. Here is my greeting. Say, Hina, give me some of the fish, Say, Hina, don’t be unkind. Thou art from Kalihi. I am from Kalihi. The woman that fished for crabs was from Kalihi. The rope was pulled and broken, The covering floated away with the calabash. The woman went in pursuit of the calabash. The sea of Kalihi that breaks the strings of the calabash. Kalihi is immovable. Say, Hina, give me some fish. Say, Hina, make answer. Give me some of the fish."
"Ma keia oli ana a Kamapuaa, noonoo o Hina, o Kamapuaa keia. Makau iho la, nokamea o Hina no ka wahine i hele i Kalihi, a lilo ai ka ipu papai.","By this chant recited by Kamapuaa, Hina began to think that this must be Kamapuaa himself, and so she became afraid, because it was she who went to Kalihi and there lost her calabash of crabs."
"Nolaila, wahi aku ana o Hina i ke kua o ka hale, i wahi e puka ai i waho, no ka mea, ua paa ka puka ia Kamapuaa. A hemo o Hina i waho o ka hale, holokiki aku la ia e olelo ia Kahikiula a me Kahikihonuakele. E mama awa ana nae laua. I aku o Hina: “E!

After Hina had made her escape from the house, she ran and told Kahikiula and Kahikihonuakele, who were preparing awa in another house, and said to them: “Say, Kamapuaa is coming; he has arrived.” At this they all went out to greet and to humble themselves before him. Hina then chanted a mele that was composed in his honor, in order to please him:"
"I luna kukui o Hanunanuna, I ke kaha o Waimalu, Kuu kane ua—e! Aohe makana i ko inaina e! Eia ka lani poko la, He waimaka ke ua iho nei, Ke ua iho nei a pulu la, Pulu kuu kino i ka manao la, Kuu keiki o ka pali hii e!","In the top of the kukui on Hanunanuna, On the shores of Waimalu, My sire, it is raining. I have no gifts to offer so as to appease your anger, For there is but the insufficient heavens, For the tears are coming down as rain. It is raining; I am wet; My body is wet with the rain, My son of the cliffs carried on the bosom."
"Hele aku la o Hina a moe malalo o Kamapuaa, noho iho la o Kamapuaa i luna o Hina. Oli mai la o Kahikiula i ka inoa o Kamapuaa:","Hina then approached Kamapuaa and laid down at his feet, and Kamapuaa sat on her. Kahikiula then chanted a mele in honor of Kamapuaa, saying:"
"I luna kukui o Hanunanuna, I ke kaha o Waimea, Kuu kane ua—e! Aohe a’u makana i ko huhu, Hookahi makana o ka waimaka, Ke ua iho nei e, a pulu la. [ ]","In the top of the kukui on Hanunanuna, On the shores of Waimea, My sire, it is raining. I have no gifts to offer so as to appease your anger, The only gift is my tears. It is raining; I am wet. [ ]"
"Hele aku la o Kahikiula a moe iho la malalo o Kamapuaa, e like me Hina. O Kahikihonuakele, kau mai la i kana mele ia Kamapuaa:","Kahikiula then approached Kamapuaa and laid down at his feet like Hina. Kahikihonuakele then chanted his mele in honor of Kamapuaa, saying:"
"Hanau ae no apopo ka olua keiki, O kou inoa no ka hoi keia, O iliala i ka hau anu o Kaala, Ko ili mahuna i ka awa, I noho i uka o Kaliupeapea, O ka ua kilinoe hau o Keke, I uka hoi ka hala me ka lehua, I kupu i uka o Kaliuwaa, O kou inoa ia e o mai.","Your son was born a bundle. This is indeed your name, The fragrant skin of the cold dew of Kaala, Your skin that is become scaly from awa Which grew in the uplands of Kaliupeapea, The fine rain of Keke, The hala and the lehua were in the uplands, Which sprouted in the uplands of Kaliuwaa. This is your name; make answer."
"A pau ke oli ana o Kahikihonuakele, hele aku la ia a moe i mua o Kamapuaa. Ku ae la o Kamapuaa a hehi ia lakou a hele aku la, nokamea, ua huhu loa o Kamapuaa ia lakou.

[ ]","At the conclusion of the chant by Kahikihonuakele, he approached Kamapuaa and laid in his presence. Kamapuaa then stood up and stepped on them all and proceeded on his way, for he was very angry with them all. At this Hina began to chant all the meles composed in honor of Kamapuaa, trying to please him and in that way save themselves; but all her meles and pleadings were in vain, for Kamapuaa would not listen. When Hina saw that all her efforts to appease the anger of Kamapuaa were in vain, she disrobed and went naked, following him. When Kamapuaa saw Hina following after him, entirely nude, he turned and abandoned his angry feelings, and said: “Your fisherman shall die, however, because of the words he spoke to me, that I must dive down into the sea to get my fish.” To this request Hina gave her consent. The hog then started in and in a very short time the fisherman was completely consumed. Kamapuaa then said to his parents: “Why did you two not recognize me?” The parents replied: “Because we knew that you had the form of a hog and did not have the form of a human being.” At this Kamapuaa showed them all his different forms; and after this he returned to Kahiki with Koea.

His father was Kukaohialaka. At the birth of Kaulu, he was in the form of a piece of cord. He had two older brothers. Kaholeha was the name of the brother who loved him, while the other brother did not like him at all, in fact he hated him. Some time after this the brother that thought a good deal of Kaulu was taken away by Kane and Kanaloa, to the island of Kuaihelani, where he was kept. Being attached to this brother, because of his great kindness, Kaulu concluded that he would go to Kuaihelani in search of him. On the voyage Kaulu encountered several obstacles. First he encountered large and terrible waves; secondly, he encountered the long waves; thirdly, he encountered Kuilioloa; fourthly he encountered Keaumiki and Keauka, and fifthly he encountered the gods or ghosts."
"A hiki o Kaulu i Kuaihelani, hele aku la ia a loko o ka ao loulu hou e owili ana, pee iho la ia. A ahiahi, hemo mai la kona kaikuaana i waho, hele aku la o Kaulu e launa pu.

That evening he saw his brother coming out of the house, so he went to meet him. Kaulu then asked him: “How are you getting along?” Kaholeha replied: “I am not happy.” Kaulu again asked him: “What do you all do in the evening?” The brother replied: “We drink awa.” “Yes,” said Kaulu, “when it is time to drink awa, you tell the gods that they can go ahead and drink their’s and that you will take your’s later. When it comes to your turn to drink awa, you order the gods not to talk, and when they are quiet then you call out to me as follows: ‘Say, my god, here is our awa.’ I will then answer back: ‘Drink it. I will take the intoxicating portion.’ ” The brother returned into the house and in time carried out the orders given him. When the gods heard the reply from without, they said: “What a loud voiced god you have. It even calls differently.” This was continued so often that Kane and Kanaloa became vexed and so they sent their messengers to fly up to Makalii and inquire of him of the nature of this thing, whether it is a human being or a god."
"A hiki ua elele i o Makalii la, olelo aku la ia ia, a lohe ia, olelo mai la: “Aohe akua, he kanaka, o Kaulu ka inoa.” A hiki na elele i mua o Kane laua o Kanaloa.

He replied: “The voice is not the voice of a god; it is the voice of a man, Kaulu by name.” When the messengers arrived back in the presence of Kane and Kanaloa, they reported what they had been told by Makalii. When the two [ ] heard the report, they became very angry with the brother of Kaulu, and so the two devised a way of getting Kaholeha into trouble. After they had thought out a plan they tempted Kaholeha to go down with them into the sea for a bath and to ride the surf. When they came to the place where the surf was breaking Kaholeha was caught by a shark and eaten. Therefore Kaulu went down to the seashore [in search of him]."
"Wehe ae la o Kaulu i ka waha ona, omo ia ke kai a pau i loko a maloo iho la ke kai, ahuwale na ia a pau loa. Noke o Kaulu i ka luku i ka mano, a me na i’a e ae.

Kaulu then proceeded to kill all the sharks and other kinds of fish. In this search for Kaholeha, Kaulu killed several fish without being able to find him, so he flew up to Makalii and asked him. When Kaulu arrived at the home of Makalii, he found him asleep with his face turned up, for Makalii was a very old man, but possessed of great powers and was very strong. When Kaulu saw him, he went up to him and pinched his leg, causing Makalii to wake up and cry out in pain."
"Oia ke kaikaina huhu o Makalii, ike mai la ia ia Kaulu. Amo mai la ia i ka pohaku nui, o Ikuwa ka inoa, ua like me Maui ka nui o ka pohaku. Nana aku la o Kaulu a ike.

When he saw Kaulu he took up a large rock called Ikuwa, being about as large as the island of Maui. When Kaulu saw this, he asked of Makalii: “Who is this man holding a large rock?” Makalii replied: “It is my ill tempered younger brother.” When Kaaona came up to Kaulu, he hurled the rock at Kaulu, thinking to crush him with it. Kaulu then stuck up his poi finger and held the rock up. Kaulu then said: “Say, the rock from the strong man is held up. When is it to fall down?” At seeing this Kaaona ran off fearful of being put to death by Kaulu."
"A mahope o keia, ninau aku o Kaulu ia Makalii: “Auhea kuu kaikuaana, e hai mai oe i ka mea nana i pepehi i ike au.” Olelo aku o Makalii: “Aia ko kaikuaana i loko o ke ’lii o na mano a pau loa.” Ninau aku o Kaulu: “E hai pono mai oe i ka mea nana i ai kuu kaikuaana?” Wahi a Makalii: “Aia i ka pukoa nui, e hamama ana o luna, he mano ia.”","Sometime after this Kaulu inquired of Makalii, saying: “Where is my older brother? Tell me who killed him, that I may know the person.” Makalii replied: “Your older brother is within the king of all the sharks.” Kaulu again asked him: “Tell me clearly who eat my brother.” Makalii replied: “He is in the great mound of coral rock which has an opening at the top, which is in reality a shark.”"
"He mano nui ia, oia ke ’lii o na mano a pau loa o loko o ke kai, a nana i moni ola ke kaikuaana o Kaulu. A pau ka Makalii olelo ana ia Kaulu, hoi mai la o Kaulu a hiki i mua o Kalakeenuiakane.

Mahope o laila, hoi mai la o Kaulu me ke kaikuaana.","Kalakeenuiakane was a very large shark; he was the king of all the sharks in the sea, and it was this shark that swallowed alive the brother of Kaulu. At the conclusion of the conversation between Makalii and Kaulu, Kaulu returned and proceeded to the presence of Kalakeenuiakane and asked him: “Say, have you seen my brother?” “Yes, I have seen him; he is no more; he has turned into hair and into filth.” Kaulu then asked him: “Are you strong?” “Yes,” said the shark. “What is your strength?” Kalakeenuiakane replied: “If I open my mouth my upper jaw can reach the heaven while my lower jaw rests at the bottom of the earth.” Kaulu then asked of his own hands: “Say, Limakaukahi and Limapaihala, is he really strong?” The hands replied: [ ] “No.” The shark then opened its mouth and Kaulu stepped in and held the jaws open. He then called those in the belly of the shark to come out, and Kaholeha came forth; his hair was all gone, but he was still alive. Shortly after this Kaulu and his brother returned home."
"I aku o Kaulu i ke kaikuaana: “Mamua aku oe, mahope aku nei au.” Ia wa mimi o Kaulu i ke kai, a hoi hou ke kai e like me mamua. Eia nae, ua hohono a awaawa ke kai a hiki i keia la, aole pela mamua.","When they were ready to come away, Kaulu said to his brother: “You go on ahead, I will follow behind.” Kaulu then urinated and the sea was restored to its former condition. But it was salty and has smelled bad to this day; it was not so before."
"Hoi mai la o Kaulu ma mai Kuaihelani mai me kona kaikuaana a hiki i Moanalua. Hoonoho o Kaulu i ke kaikuaana i laila, hele mai la oia i ka makaikai a hiki i Niuhelewai, Kapalama, e noho ana o Haumea i laila.","Kaulu and his brother then returned from Kuaihelani and stopped at Moanalua, where Kaholeha remained, while Kaulu went off to Niuhelewai to see the place. Niuhelewai is a place at Kapalama, where Haumea lived."
"He ’kua o Haumea, aohe mea koe ia ia i ka ai ia, he wahine. A hiki o Kaulu, e moe ana o Haumea, hoala ae la o Kaulu a ala o Haumea. Ninau mai la o Haumea: “E hele ana oe i hea?” I aku o Kaulu: “I ka makaikai.” “Aole pono ke hele, he kapu keia wahi ia’u, he make.” I aku o Kaulu: “He ikaika no oe?” “Ae!” pela mai o Haumea. I aku o Kaulu: “Ae, e hoi au, a popo hiki mai au, hakaka kaua.” Ae mai o Haumea.","Haumea was a ghost [or akua] and no one who fell in its way was saved; all would be eaten up. Haumea was a woman. When Kaulu came to the home of Haumea, he found the ghost asleep, so Kaulu woke her up. Haumea then asked Kaulu: “Where are you going?” Kaulu replied: “Sightseeing.” “You cannot go any further; this place is sacred to me and death shall meet those who disobey.” Kaulu then asked the ghost: “Are you strong?” Haumea replied: “Yes.” Kaulu again said: “Yes, I will return and tomorrow I will come again, when we will fight.” Haumea assented to this."
"Eia ko Kaulu manao ia Haumea ma laila i loaa ona koko e paa ai o Haumea, oia na koko a Makalii, o Maoleha ma. Lele aku la o Kaulu a hiki ia Makalii, nonoi aku la i na koko.

Kahea aku la o Kaulu me ka leo nui:","The reason why Kaulu deferred the fight with Haumea was because he wished to get some nets (koko) to catch Haumea with. These were the nets of Makalii, called “Maoleha” and its mate. Kaulu then flew up to Makalii and asked for the nets. Makalii allowed him to take them, and Kaulu returned with the nets and he again found Haumea asleep. Kaulu then surrounded the house with four thicknesses of real fish nets and two thicknesses of the nets of Makalii, Maoleha and its mate. When Kaulu saw that the house of Haumea was completely encompassed with nets, he called out in a loud voice:"
"E ala e Haumea! Ua ao, ua kani ka moa, Ua lele ka okai o ke ao, Aia i luna ka Huhui, Eia au la o Kaulu, Ko hoa hakaka. E ala oe.","Wake up Haumea, It is daylight, the cock has crowed, Darkness has fled, Pleiades has risen. Here I am, Kaulu, Your opponent. You must wake up."
"A lohe o Haumea, ala mai la. I nana ae ka hana, ua paa o waho i ka upena. E noke aku ana i ke aki i ka upena, o ka hele ia a pau na upena eha, koe o na koko a Makalii, o Maoleha ma.

[ ]","When Haumea heard the call, she woke up and looking about saw that she was entirely surrounded with nets. She then began to tear them with her teeth. After cutting through the four thickness of fish nets she came to the nets of Makalii, Maoleha and its mate. At these nets Haumea was unable to cut them, and became so entangled and exhausted that she went to sleep. While asleep Kaulu set the house on fire, which consumed Haumea, killing her. [ ]"
"A make o Haumea, pii aku la o Kaulu mai Niuhelewai aku a hiki i Nuuanu, mai laila aku a hiki i Koolau. E noho ana o Lonokaeho, ia ia o Koolau ia wa.

At this time Lonokaeho had charge of Koolau. This man had eight foreheads which were all sharp and very powerful. When Kaulu came in the presence of Lonokaeho, Lonokaeho asked him: “Where are you from?” Kaulu replied: “I came along this way.” Lonokaeho said: “No person is allowed to come this way, for the place is sacred and death will result, for I have placed a kapu over it, and because of this people fear me to this very time. If you are strong you shall live, but if not I will kill you.” Kaulu replied: “It is because I am strong that I am able to reach here.” Lonokaeho then exposed his eight foreheads, one was of stone, another of sharp edged rock, another of wood, another of ohia, another of certain weeds, another of maile vines, another of ieie , another of hala. On each of these foreheads grew lehua trees. When Kaulu saw the foreheads of Lonokaeho, he asked of his two hands, Limakaukahi and Limapaihala: “How about the eight foreheads of Lonokaeho?” The hands made reply: “They will not escape us.” Kaulu then said to Lonokaeho: “Then why don’t your eight foreheads go ahead and cut me?” Lonokaeho replied: “If they cut you, you will be dead, you will not be saved.” The first forehead then came down, the one of sharp rock, but Kaulu dodged, missing him and the forehead struck the ground. The ieie and the maile vines crawled over and covered it, which prevented it from getting up again. When the forehead tried to get up it was unable to move. Thus were all of the eight foreheads of Lonokaeho overcome, and Kaulu thereby became possessed of all Koolau. Kaulu then proceeded on to Kualoa at the Kaoio point, where Mokolii was living, a wizard in the form of a rat."
"He kupua ino keia, aohe kanaka koe ia ia i ka ai ia, aohe wahine koe. He mea mau ia ia ka noho i ke alanui e kiai ai, a e hoopunipuni ai me na olelo maalea. A hiki o Kaulu, ninau mai la o Mokolii: “Mahea mai oe?” I aku o Kaulu: “Maanei mai nei no.” “Ae, he mea ai oe na’u no keia la.” I aku o Kaulu: “Aia no hoi paha i ka ikaika.” E hao mai ana o Mokolii ia Kaulu, paa i na niho.

[ ]","This wizard was a very evil person and no one, man or woman, was saved who came within its reach; all would be eaten. It was customary with this wizard to sit and watch by the wayside for people to cunningly coax and deceive them to come nearer. When Kaulu arrived at the place, Mokolii inquired of him: “Where are you from?” Kaulu replied: “I came along this way.” “Yes, you will become my food for this day.” Kaulu made reply: “You can have me if you are strong.” Mokolii then jumped on Kaulu and held him with its teeth. Kaulu then flew up with Mokolii, and when they got into the blue sky Mokolii came falling down, breaking every bone in its body, killing it. The place thus became the property of Kaulu. [ ]"

He belonged to Alanapo, in Humuula, at Koloa, Kauai. Alanapo was a kapued temple sacred to the gods from the time of darkness, and it was in this temple that Palila was brought up by the gods, and while here he received his instruction in all the arts of warfare."
"O Kaluaopalena ka makuakane o Palila, o Mahinui ka makuahine, o Hina ke kupunawahine o Palila, nana i lawe i loko o Alanapo e noho ai. O Namakaokalani ke ’lii o kekahi aoao o Kauai, o Kaluaopalena, ko kekahi aoao.

Hina was the grandmother of Palila and it was she that took him to Alanapo to be brought up by the gods. Namakaokalani was the king of one side of Kauai, while Kaluaopalena ruled the other side. These two were at war with one another constantly; and Kaluaopalena was seen to be losing and it became apparent that in a short time he would be defeated when Namakaokalani would have in his possession the whole of Kauai."
"O kahi a na kanaka e kaua ana, o Paa ka inoa o ka aina, malaila na ’lii me na koa, a me na kanaka he lehulehu loa.

While the battle was at its height, Palila rose and came out of Alanapo, took up his war club, Huliamahi by name, and went out until he came to a rise looking down on the lowlands of Paa. The name of this rise is Komoikeanu. While he stood meditating, looking at the battle that was raging below him, he concluded that it was a battle being fought against his father; so he twirled his club and threw it. The club flew through the air, traveling at such speed that the earth shook and the trees were thrown down. It was by means of the falling trees that the warriors of Namakaokalani were destroyed until there were none left. This destruction of the army of Namakaokalani caused his defeat and Kaluaopalena, the father of Palila, became the ruler of the whole of Kauai."
"A hiki o Palila i Ewa, ma Waikele, e noho ana o Kamaikaahui, he mano kanaka, elua ona ano, he kanaka a he mano.","Upon the arrival of Palila in Ewa, at Waikele, there he met Kamaikaahui, a human shark of two natures, that of a human being and that of a shark."
"No Mualea i Hana, Maui o Kamaikaahui, he kanaka ai kanaka. Aia ma ke kua kona waha, a me na niho mano, a mai laila mai kona hele ana mai a noho ma Waikele. E like me kona hana i Maui, pela kona hana i Oahu nei. Ka ai i ke kanaka, a ke nahu. [ ] Nolaila, makau ke ’lii o Oahu nei, o Ahuapau, a me na kanaka.

His mouth was at his back containing several rows of teeth like the shark. It was from Mualea that he came and made his home at Waikele. As was his practice while living on Maui, so did he indulge on Oahu. Every time he got a chance he would secretly kill men and eat them up. When Ahuapau, who was [ ] king of Oahu at this time, saw this, he and his people became afraid of the man. He therefore made a decree, that the man who could drive Kamaikaahui away from Oahu would be made king and given the privilege of first entering the temple of Kanelaauli, built at Kahehuna, below Punchbowl."
"Ma keia olelo a ke ’lii, ua lohe o Palila. Nolaila, olelo o Palila: “Ina e ike aku au iaia, alaila, holo.” Ia wa, hoike o Palila me ka laau palau ana o Huliamahi, holo o Kamaikaahui a lele i loko o ke kai. Hahau aku o Palila i ka laau palau, lele hou i uka, pela ka hana ana a make o Kamaikaahui, ia Palila.","When Palila heard the king’s decree, he made the remark, saying: “If I look at him once he will run away.” Soon after this Palila met Kamaikaahui who, upon seeing Palila with the war club, Huliamahi, ran and tried to jump into the sea. Palila then struck at the man preventing him from falling into the sea, and every time he tried to jump Palila would strike him. This was continued until Kamaikaahui was killed."
"He koa kaulana o Olomana, i ka loihi a me ka ikaika. Ua makau o Ahuapau ke ’lii o Oahu nei ia ia. A nolaila, aole e hele aku ma Koolau, mai ka lae o Makapuu a ka lae o Kaoio ma Kualoa, ua kapu ia Olomana.","Olomana was a noted warrior, famous for his great strength and his enormous height. Ahuapau, the king of Oahu, was in fear of this man and because of this he never traveled to Koolau. From the Makapuu point to the Kaoio point, at Kualoa, was kapued and sacred to Olomana."
"He umikumamalua kaha-ku o Olomana, ma ke kua, ke ku pololei a kaha mai ke poo mai a na wawae. Penei nae ke ano, akolu kapuai ma ke kaha hookahi, ua like me kanakolukumamaono na kaha he umikumamalua.

When Palila arrived at the top of the Nuuanu cliff he laid down his club and sped on till he reached Kaelepulu, the place where Olomana was standing. In this flight of the club, Palila seized hold of the end and was carried by it until he lit on the shoulder of Olomana, whereupon Olomana asked Palila: “Where are you from, you most conceited boy? for my shoulder has never been stepped on by anybody, and here you have gone and done it.” Palila replied: “I am from the kapued temple; from Alanapo in Humuula, Kauai. My name is Palila and I am a soldier.” When Olomana heard this he was sore afraid and begged of Palila that he be saved. Palila, however, refused , saying: “You shall not live.” Palila then slapped him cutting away one half, being that mountain which is Mahinui and leaving one half, the hill of Olomana, which stands at the same place to this day."
"Pela i make ai o Olomana ia Palila, a pela i puni ai o Oahu nei ia Ahuapau, ka makuahunowai o Palila.","This was the way Olomana was killed by Palila, and in this way Ahuapau, the father-in-law of Palila, came in possession of the whole of Oahu."

At the time of his arrival a battle was being fought between Kulukulua the king of Hilo and Wanua the king of Hamakua; and Kulukulua was about to be beaten by Wanua, for Wanua had three famous warriors with him who were noted for their great strength; they were Moanonuikalehua, Kumuonuiaiake and Puupuukaamai. When they came together, Palila swung his club but once so strong that the earth shook to its very foundation and the club was buried deep into the ground and all three were killed. He after this began the slaughter of the men and went as far as Kukaiau in Hamakua, making the victory complete. [ ]"

"O ke kumu o keia kaua ana, o ka miko ana o na maka o Kihapiilani i ke kai paakai a kona kaikuaana, ke ’lii ia ia o Maui.

The cause of the battle that was fought sometime after this was because the salt water from a dish of fish was thrown into the eyes of Kihapiilani by his older brother, the king who was then reigning over Maui. When Kihapiilani arrived on Hawaii, Keawenuiaumi asked him: “What is the cause of this journey?” “I am after some one to be my avenger. My older brother has thrown the salt water from a dish of fish into my eyes.” Shortly after this the officers were sent out to make a circuit of Hawaii with the order to call the people to come together, hew out canoes, make spears, the long and the short ones, and to go in search of shark’s teeth. At the end of about six months everything was in readiness."
"Mahope o laila, holo mai la na waa he nui loa, mai Hawaii a Maui. Ua paa ka moana i na waa, a ua lilo i alanui hele, no na kanaka. A ua kapaia ma ka moolelo o Hawaii nei, oia ka waa nui o ka helu mua ia.",After the preparations were completed they set sail for Maui. The canoes on this expedition were so many that it covered the ocean from Hawaii to Maui and the people used them as a road to cross over on. It is said in Hawaiian history that the number of canoes used in this expedition was the greatest known.
"A hiki lakou i Kauiki ma Maui, i luna o laila ke ’lii kahi i noho ai me kona poe koa, i ke ao kaua maoli, i ka po, he kii ke ku mai i ka ulili, e iho mai ai i lalo o Kapueokahi.","When the army arrived at Kauiki, Maui, it was found that the king had moved and was living or encamped with his warriors on the hill itself. In the daytime regular battles were fought, but at night a large image was stood up at the top end of the ladder used for climbing up and down the hill; it was the only way by which one could get to Kapueokahi."
"O ia ka inoa o ua kii la; he kii nui, i ke ahiahi poeleele, lawe ia mai la a ku i ka puka e pii aku ai, a e iho mai ai mai ka puu o Kauiki mai. Alaila, ku ua kii nei me ka [ ] laau palau.

In the evening, just about dusk, the image would be brought up and made [ ] to stand at the top end of the ladder. This ladder was the only means of getting up this hill. The image was then made to stand with a war club in hand. On the first night, some of the warriors of Keawenuiaumi, Omaukamau and others, tried to get up the hill, but when they came in sight of something standing at the top end of the ladder, believing it to be a real person, they became afraid and returned. This attempt to get to the top of the hill was kept up for three nights."
"A kokoke o Piimaiwaa, halalo aku la ia me ka hookaa i kana laau palau, aole o iala hookaa, hoi keia ma ke hema hookaa, aole o iala hookaa.","At last Piimaiwaa decided to make an attempt to see this big man for himself. When he came near the man he took his war club and began twirling it, but the man refused to respond. Piimaiwaa then took the club in his left hand and again twirled it, but the man would not so much as move his club."
"Nolaila, hele keia a kokoke, hoopa keia i ka laau palau koele ana.

At last he reached a position where he could touch him with his club, so he tapped the man a light blow and he heard the sound as of wood. At this he was made certain that this was a wooden man put up there to deceive them. He then took the image and threw it down the cliff and he climbed up to the top of the hill, where he met and killed all the people with the exception of the king who managed to escape."
"Nolaila, puni o Maui ia Kihapiilani, a noho alii iho la, a nana i hana kela alanui kaulana maloko o ka nahele o Oopuola, a me ke alanui pupu i Molokai, a hiki i keia la.","This victory gave Maui completely into the hands of Kihapiilani and he became its king. It was by him that the famous roadway, which is seen going through the forest of Oopuola, was built, as well as the shell road which was built around Molokai, traces of which can be seen to this day."
"Imaikalani, he ’lii makapo ia, aohe ona mau maka, aka, he kanaka kona maka, a he manu, aka he ’lii akamai loa ma ke kaua ana, a ma ke kaka laau ana me ka hoapaio.","Imaikalani was a blind chief; he was without sight, but he had other men to serve him and to act as his eyes. He also had some birds who helped see things for him. He was a chief who was very skillful in the use of all weapons of warfare and particularly so in the use of the war club."
"Kena aku la o Umi ia Omaokamau, e hele e kaua me Imaikalani, a lohe o Omaokamau, hele aku la ia a hiki i kahi o Imaikalani.

Alaila, hoi aku la o Omaokamau, a hiki i mua o ke ’lii o Umi, ninau mai la o Umi: “Pehea kau hele ana aku nei i kahi o Imaikalani?” I aku o Omaokamau: “Pehea auanei kau, he makapo na maka o Imaikalani, aka, o ka noonoo he pololei, hana mai nei maua, a no koiala akamai, makau mai nei au a hoi mai la.”","When the capture of the hill was completed, Umi ordered Omaokamau to go and fight Imaikalani. When Omaokamau heard this he proceeded to the home of Imaikalani. When Omaokamau was drawing near the home of Imaikalani the birds sounded a note. At this note of warning from the birds Imaikalani said to his men: “Say, there is a man.” The men said: “There is nobody.” Imaikalani remarked: “Watch out.” While the two men were watching, Omaokamau soon after appeared. The men then said to Imaikalani: “Yes, there is a man, he is coming, and he carries a war club in his hand.” Imaikalani said: “That is Omaokamau, one of the warriors of Umi; he is well versed in the art of throwing the spear; his main strength is in his right arm, his left is weak; watch him and see when he twirls his war club.” When Omaokamau came up to the men he stood and twirled his war club. When the two men saw this, they said to Imaikalani: “Say, the man is twirling his club.” [ ] When Imaikalani heard the report of his two men, he stood up and began twirling his club. The two men kept on twirling their clubs all the time until they struck at each other. Omaokamau struck his club to his right, but somehow Imaikalani warded off the blow by the use of his club and the first blow aimed by Omaokamau missed. They again twirled their clubs and after a time Omaokamau struck to his left, but again his blow was warded off and he again missed Imaikalani. After this second miss Omaokamau turned around and returned to Umi. When he came up to Umi, Umi asked him: “How was your trip to the home of Imaikalani?” Omaokamau replied: “I don’t know what to say. The eyes of Imaikalani are both sightless but his thinking powers are faultless. I fought him for a time, but he warded off my blows so skilfully that I was afraid of him and so I came back.”"
"Ia Omaokamau e olelo ana ia Umi, pane mai la o Koi: “Aole no paha e make o Imaikalani ia oe, no ka mea, aole oe i helu ia mai Hawaii mai nei a kakou i holo mai nei. Owau no ka i helu ia.” Alaila, hele aku la o Koi a kahi a na manu e kau ana, kani ae la na manu, lohe no o Imaikalani, kena aku la i na kanaka e nana aku, a ike laua. Olelo aku la laua ia Imaikalani: “He kanaka nui, ili kou, he piipii ka lauoho o ke poo.” I aku o Imaikalani: “O Koi na, he kanaka akamai no i ka pana laau, he ikaika hema kona, a he nawaliwali ka akau. Ua like no laua me Omaokamau.”","While Omaokamau was reporting to Umi, Koi spoke up: “Of course you could not kill Imaikalani; you were not counted of any consequence while we were in Hawaii any way. I am the one that is of consequence.” Koi then started off and went as far as the place where the birds were stationed. When he heard the birds give the note of warning, which was also heard by Imaikalani, he was puzzled to know what this meant. When Imaikalani heard the notes of the birds he sent his two men to go and see who it was. When the men came out they saw a man, so they reported to Imaikalani: “It is a large man with dark skin and the hair on his head is curly.” Imaikalani replied: “That is Koi; he is also very skillful in the use of the war club, but he is strong in the left arm and weak in the right; he is just like Omaokamau.”"
"A hiki o Koi, kaa ae la ia i kana laau palau. Ku ae la no hoi o Imaikalani, a kaa i kana laau. Hahau iho la o Koi i kana laau palau me ka ikaika loa, he mea ole ia ia Imaikalani, a pela no hoi ma ka akau. Mahope o laila, hoi aku la o Koi a hiki i mua o Umi, ninau mai o Umi: “Pehea kau hele ana aku nei i o Imaikalani la?” I aku o Koi: “Aohe koa e hele aku i mua o Imaikalani, ua ike pono aku nei au, ua like no me ka Omaokamau olelo a kakou i lohe ai, pela no ka’u ike ana aku nei. Hookahi a’u kaa laau ana, i ka lua, hahau au ia Imaikalani, he mea ole ia i ka’u ike aku. A pau ia, hoi hou no wau, he mea ole no ia Imaikalani.

Ua like no ka Piimaiwaa olelo me ka Omaokamau ma.","When Koi came up to his opponents he began twirling his war club and as he came within striking distance he raised his club and let it come down with all his might on Imaikalani, but it was warded off by Imaikalani as though it was nothing. Again Koi raised his club and let it come down on his left, but again he was foiled. When Koi saw that he could not get the best of Imaikalani, he turned around and returned to Umi. When he came in the presence of Umi, Umi asked him: “How did you get along with your trip to Imaikalani?” Koi replied: “No warrior can stand before Imaikalani, for I have seen him with my own eyes. What Omaokamau has said and all the things which we have heard are perfectly true, and I must therefore give the same report. After I had twirled my club once on the second time I struck at Imaikalani, but from what I could see it was as nothing to him. After the first blow I gave him another one but that, too, was as nothing to Imaikalani. I therefore became afraid and returned.” While Koi was giving his account of the encounter, Piimaiwaa spoke up to Koi: “The bones of a youngster like you could not be old enough; here are the bones that are well matured.” Piimaiwaa then stood up, took up his club and started off. When he came up with Imaikalani, he heard the birds. His appearance was then reported by the men to Imaikalani, that another warrior was coming. As Piimaiwaa stood in the presence of Imaikalani, Imaikalani stood up ready to defend himself. After trying his skill against Imaikalani Piimaiwaa saw that he was unable to best his opponent, so he too returned to the king and told him of what he had done, which was the same thing reported by Omaokamau and Koi."
"Ma keia mau mea a pau loa a lakou i hana ai, ua makau loa ia o Imaikalani, a ua manao lakou e haalele i ke kaua ana ia ia. [ ]","On account of the failure on the part of Umi to kill Imaikalani, Imaikalani was greatly feared and they all but decided to abandon the fight and leave Imaikalani alone. [ ]"
"He mau anahulu i hala ma keia noho ana, launa aku la o Omaokamau me kekahi kanaka kamaaina. I mai la ke kamaaina: “Heaha ka mea e make ole nei o Imaikalani ia oukou?” I aku o Omaokamau: “Heaha hoi.” I mai kela: “Ua make, he wahi iki wale no, aole i mahuahua.” Alaila, nonoi aku la o Omaokamau ia ia: “E hai mai i kahi e make ai, o Imaikalani,” a ae mai la kela.

It will not take much of an exertion.” Omaokamau then asked him: “Will you tell me how it can be done?” The man then said to Omaokamau: “Say, if you obey what I will tell you, then I will do what you want.” Omaokamau then again asked him: “What do you want me to do?” The man said: “Don’t speak a word about me and never repeat to any one that I told you how to get the best of Imaikalani, because I am his own immediate servant, a backbone; I am one of his kahili bearers.” Omaokamau then gave his promise, that he would not tell any one, not to the king, not to his own brothers nor to any other person. “If you should hear or know that I have broken my promise, then my life shall be forfeited,” continued Omaokamau. Because of this promise made by Omaokamau, the man said: “The birds which sit on the outside are his eyes, and it is by them that he is warned of the approach of any person. On hearing this warning he prepared himself for the conflict. The men with him are also his eyes; they are the ones who tell him when the enemy is near and this gives him a chance to use his wits and to defend himself. But if the birds and the men are first killed then Imaikalani can be slain, he will not escape.”"
"A lohe o Omaokamau i keia mau olelo a ke kamaaina, ku ae ia a hele, a hiki i kahi e kau ana na manu, hili ae la ia i na manu i kana laau palau, a haule iho la i lalo, a make iho la na manu.

When he came up to the place where the birds generally sat he crept up cautiously and struck them with his club, killing them. But before Omaokamau had the chance to kill the birds, they gave their warning note and Imaikalani heard it; so he asked his men to look and see if a man was coming. The men then looked and saw that it was Omaokamau. When Omaokamau came up to the guards, they thought he had come to do battle with Imaikalani, and that he would come to the battle ground and there make his stand, when Imaikalani would get ready to fight him; but in this they were mistaken, for Omaokamau did not go to the battle ground but came right along fearlessly with his war club in his hand. As soon as he came up to the two men he struck them with his war club, killing them. He then turned to Imaikalani and poked him in the stomach with the point of his club, killing him."
"Hoi aku la o Omaokamau a hiki i mau o ke ’lii o Umi, olelo aku la i ka make ana o Imaikalani ia ia, a lohe o Umi a me na mea a pau loa, ninau mai la lakou i ke kumu o ka make ana.

When Umi and the rest of the people heard this, they asked him how he was able to kill the great and famous Imaikalani. Omaokamau then said to them: “This is how I was able to slay Imaikalani: Yesterday on going down to the stream of Mauoni for a bath, I met a Maui man who asked me: ‘Have you people killed Imaikalani?’ I said, ‘No.’ Then he said to me: ‘Yes, it is only a small thing to kill him.’ When I heard this, I asked him to tell me how it could be done, while I promised him at the same time that I would keep his name and identity a secret. He then told me how I was to do it; said he, ‘Here is the way to kill Imaikalani: You must first kill the birds and the two watchmen, who are Imaikalani’s guards and who give him warning of the approach of any person. Kill the birds and the men, then you will be able to kill Imaikalani.’ That is how I was able to kill him.” [ ]"

He was so fearless and strong that he fought against multitudes who opposed him and won out in all his battles. Kepakailiula was from a hen’s egg. The land of his birth was Keaau, Puna, Hawaii. The father was Ku and the mother Hina. Kiinoho and Kiihele were the adopted parents of Kepakailiula and he was brought up in the land of Paliuli."
"A hiki kona mau makahiki i ka iwakalua, he kanaka maikai loa o Kepakailiula ma kona kino. Aohe ona kina mai ka manea o kona wawae a kona piko poo.

He was without blemish; he was perfect from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. Because of this great beauty, Kiinoho sent Kiihele to travel around Hawaii in search of a wife for Kepakailiula."

O keia hele ana, eia no i ka la hookahi.","Kiihele was a very fast runner and could make three complete circuits of the island of Hawaii in one day. Starting from Paliuli he went first through the district of Hilo, where he found Kukuilauania, a very beautiful woman, but her eyes bulged out, so he left her and continued on his way to Hamakua; then on to Waimea and then to Kohala. From this point he retraced his steps and returned to Paliuli in Puna. When he arrived home his older brother, Kiinoho, asked him: “How was your journey? Have you not found a wife in all your journey?” “No, not one,” said Kiihele. Kiinoho then said to him: “You go toward the rising of the sun, toward Puna.” Kiihele assented to this and started out. All this was on the same day."

She was indeed beautiful; her eyes were beautiful and her form was beautiful to look upon; but she had one fault, her posterior was covered with large lumps, like the kind of hala seeds seen today. Kiihele left Puna and entered into the district of Kau where he found Manienie, another beautiful woman; but her one defect was that her hips were deformed so that she crawled about on her hands and feet, like the manienie [grass] that is now growing. Kiihele then left Kau and entered into Kona, where he found Makolea, a very beautiful woman and very pleasant to look upon. She was without blemish and was so beautiful that she was like the full moon."

The father’s name was Keauhou and the mother was Kahaluu. Makolea [ ] was engaged to marry Kakaalaneo, the king of Maui, because Kakaalaneo was greatly feared by all the chiefs in those days, he being a very powerful man and was very skilful in the use of the spear."
"Oia ke ’lii oi o Maui, i ke akamai loa ma ka oo ihe ana, aole e hala kana ihe i ka mea nui a me ka mea liilii.",Kakaalaneo was the king of Maui and was acknowledged as the most skilful man in the use of the spear. He was never known to miss the large things or the small things.

It was because of Makolea that Kepakailiula and Kakaalaneo shortly after this fought each other. Kepakailiula, also because of her, had to fight Kaikipaananea, the king of Kauai."

He is not to be compared with me.” When Makolea heard this, she said to Kiihele: “You go home and bring the husband. ” Kiihele assented to this. Makolea again asked: “What day are you to arrive?” Kiihele answered: “I am going home and shall be gone about two days, on the third day I will arrive with your husband.” Makolea agreed to this."

It is said that he is so skilful that he never misses a grass blade, a flea or an ant.” They remained at home until the next morning when they wept and wailed because of their great love for Paliuli. They wept for the trees, the plants they raised and everything they labored for. After the weeping they dedicated the land to their god and the land has been in his keeping to this day."

When Makolea saw how handsome [ ] Kepakailiula was she was made very happy and took him into her home. As Kepakailiula was entering the house he said to his two foster fathers, Kiinoho and Kiihele: “Here, take her maid for your wife; for you two, one wife. You may go wherever you wish. If you should hear that I am dead, then arise and continue on your way.” After his two foster parents had departed, Kepakailiula and Makolea lived on together as husband and wife."

When he came to the beach he found a small canoe lying on the dry sand; he took and dragged it to the sea and set out for Maui making a landing at Kapueokahi, in Hana. When he stepped ashore he went in search of the king’s house. As he came up to it behold there he saw Kakaalaneo under the influence of awa, and he also heard him calling for his wife: “Say, Makolea. Say, Makolea, take our mats and spread them outside of the out house, and after you have done that come and help me to the place.” After he had given this order, Makolea and her maids came to the outside of the out house with the mats and spread them out. After this was done the women went in to get Kakaalaneo. After they were gone on their errand Kepakailiula went up to the place where the mats were spread and excremented and urinated on the mats and then went and hid himself. When Kakaalaneo was brought to the mats he stepped on the filth and fell, making him very angry with Makolea and the women. He then called out to move the mats over to the stern of the canoes. Makolea did as she was told and had the mats moved to the stern of the canoes, where they went and slept for the night. After a time Kakaalaneo became so overcome with the influence of awa that he fell asleep. Kepakailiula then came and took Makolea into some bushes and spent the night there together. After sleeping for some time, Makolea awoke and began to weep, believing that Kepakailiula would be killed by Kakaalaneo. Kepakailiula upon hearing Makolea [ ] weeping asked her: “Why are you weeping?” Makolea replied: “I am weeping for you, for I am afraid my husband will kill you. His spear is never known to miss. He can hit a blade of grass, an ant or a flea. How can he miss you, your shadow being much larger?” Kepakailiula then said boastingly:"
"He hua kona, he hua ko’u, He laho kona, he laho ko’u, He kane ia, he kane au, Aole i ike ia na ai a maua, Nana paha na’u paha.","He has fruit, I have fruit, He has testes, I have testes, He is a male person, I am a male person. No one can tell of the outcome, Whether he will win or I will win."
"Momoe iho la laua, a kani ka moa mua. Olelo aku o Kepakailiula i ka wahine. “Ke hoi nei au a Hawaii, noho a hala ekolu la, alaila, hiki hou mai au. Nolaila, e kukulu oe i lepa nou, a o kau poe e aloha ai e lawe mai oe maloko o ka lepa.”","After this they again fell asleep. At the first crow of the cock, Kepakailiula said to Makolea: “I am returning to Hawaii and at the end of three days I will come again. I want you, therefore, to stand a flag wherever you are and within its sacred precincts gather all whom you love and wish to be saved.”"
"Hoi aku la o Kepakailiula a pae i Kohala. Komo aku la i loko o ka hale a moe iho la, a ao ae la lakou paina a pau loa.","Early that morning Kepakailiula boarded his canoe and set out on his journey back to Kohala, where he arrived in good time and went to sleep."
"A pau ka paina ana, olelo aku la ia i kahi wahine uuku ana, ia Kapuaokeonaona. “Ea! he wahi olelo ka’u ia oe, o kaua wale no. He punahele no anei oe i ko makuakane?” “Ae, he punahele au.

At the end of the meal he said to his young wife, Kapuaokeonaona: “Say, I have a word for you and it must be between ourselves only. Are you a favorite with your father?” “Yes,” said she. “I am a favorite. Everything I will ask he will do.” “Yes? Then tell your father to bring all the canoes of Kohala together, gather all the people, leaving no one behind, from the largest to the smallest, and then let the people accompany me to Maui on a journey of sightseeing, after which we will return.” When Kukuipahu heard the wish of his daughter, the officers and runners were sent out all over Kohala, from one end to the other carrying the orders of the king. On the third day everything was ready. On the fourth day, the whole army set out for Maui."
"A kokoke e lele i uka, olelo mai o Kepakailiula i na mea a pau loa: “E, i kai no oukou e lana ai. Owau ke lele ae iuka, i nana ae oukou ia’u a i make au, o ke ala no nei hoi ia Hawaii.

It was said that they covered the whole distance from the Upolu point to the point of Kauiki. On the trip across the canoes headed for the harbor of Hana where the king, Kakaalaneo, was then living with the chiefs and people. When the canoes came close to land, Kepakailiula said to his followers: “Say, I want you all to float here out at sea and I will go ashore alone. If you look and see that I am killed, you can turn around where you are and return to Hawaii. But if I should live, then come ashore.” Kepakailiula then went ashore taking his war club along with him. When he landed he stepped first over the wet sand, then the dry sand, then over the pohuehue vines and then over the alaalapuloa. Kakaalaneo came out to meet him, carrying two small spears, one in his right hand and one in his left. From the time Kepakailiula came ashore until he was met by Kakaalaneo, the people kept on shouting in admiration of the good looks of Kepakailiula. Some of the people pitied him so much, for fear that he would be killed by Kakaalaneo that they wept. [ ]"
"Olelo mai o Kakaalaneo me ka hookano ia Kepakailiula: “I keia la, ai kuu ihe i ko io, no ka mea, aole e hala ana kau ihe. I ka pua mauu, i ka naonao, i ka uku lele.” Pane mai o Kakaalaneo: “Ia wai mua, i ke kamaaina paha, i ka malihini paha?” I aku o Kepakailiula: “I ke kamaaina mua, he hope ka ka malihini. Pahu mai la o Kakaalaneo i ka ihe ma ka lima akau ia Kepakailiula. A kokoke wehe ae la o Kepakailiula i ka poaeae, a komo aku la ka ihe mawaena, a puliki ae la ka lima, paa ka ihe ma waena konu o ke kino. He oi ka ikaika o ka makani o ka ihe, a me ke kolili o ka maka i ka lele ana mai.","When Kakaalaneo was almost up to Kepakailiula, he said in a haughty and insulting manner: “My spear shall eat of your flesh this day, for my spear never misses a grass blade, an ant or a flea.” After this Kakaalaneo asked: “Who shall have the first chance? Shall it be the son of the soil or the stranger?” Kepakailiula replied: “Let the son of the soil take the first chance and the stranger the last.” Kakaalaneo then threw the spear that was in his right hand at Kepakailiula. When the spear came near Kepakailiula, he opened out his elbow and allowed the spear to enter in between the arm and the body, and when it was half way through he brought his arm to his body and held the spear. The spear came at such speed that when it was held it quivered for some time."
"Ma keia lele ana o ka ihe, paha mai o Kakaalaneo me ka manao ua ku o Kepakailiula , penei:","After the spear had left his hand, Kakaalaneo, thinking that Kepakailiula had been struck, chanted these words:"
"Aole no paha oe e pakele i kuu ihe, no ka mea Ua ku ka’u ihe i ka pua mauu, i ka naonao, i ka uku lele, A pehea hoi oe e pakele ai he aka nui.","You will not escape my spear, because My spear can pierce a blade of grass, an ant, a flea. How can you escape, you having a large shadow?"
"Ma keia paa ana o Kepakailiula i ka ihe, a maalili, kuu aku la ia i kiona, kahi hooleina moka.","After Kepakailiula had held the spear until its quivering had ceased, he took it and threw it to the dung heap."
"A ike o Kakaalaneo, olelo mai la: “Heaha la ka mea i loli ai ka maka o kuu ihe, he pa paha na ke Kona, ka makani kulai hale, he loaa paha i ka makani lau awa o Hana, nolaila oni ka maka o kuu ihe. Hala ae la oe i ka ihe a kuu lima akau, o ka ihe koe a kuu lima hema, loaa aku oe ai kuu ihe i ko io.” Pahu mai la o Kakaalaneo i ka ihe ma ka lima hema, a hiki ia Kepakailiula. Wehe ae la ia i ka poaeae hema, a komo mai la ka ihe malaila, a maalili iho la ka ikaika o ka ihe, kuu aku la o Kepakailiula i kiona e like me ka ihe mua. Olelo mai o Kakaalaneo: “U! ua noho ae nei au a he make koe i ka aina, aohe hala o ka’u ihe, a ia oe ae nei hala kuu ihe kuku.”","When Kakaalaneo saw this, he said: “What is it that has caused the point of my spear to depart from the spot aimed at? Was it because of the south wind, the wind that blows down houses? Or was it the awa leaf wind of Hana? for my spear has indeed missed its mark. That spear from my right hand has missed; there yet remains the spear in my left; it will pierce you and will yet eat your flesh.” Kakaalaneo then threw the spear that was in his left hand, and as it came flying toward Kepakailiula, he opened out the left elbow a little bit causing the spear to enter between the arm and body, and when it was half way through, he closed in his arm and held the spear there quivering, after which he took and threw it on the dung heap like the other one. Kakaalaneo then said: “Yes, here I have lived on the land and am now well on in years and my spear has never missed before this: but here you have caused them to miss the mark.”"
"A pau ka olelo ana, eu aku o Kakaalaneo e holo. Kahea aku o Kepakailiula mahope. “E holo ana ka hoi ua koa i ke aha?” Ia wa, hualepo o Kepakailiula i kana laau palau. Mai ka lepo ka pii ana ae a loaa o Kakaalaneo, mai ka miona lemu, a ke poo ka nahae. Hookahi a Kakaalaneo huaolelo i pane ae a make loa, penei. “E na ’lii o Maui.

Hookahi kanaka, hookahi lima, a pela kahi lima, o ka mea holo aku ka mea pakele. O ka mea ku mai e hakaka, pau loa i ka make.","At the close of these remarks, Kakaalaneo attempted to run away. Kepakailiula then called out to him: “Why is the great soldier running away?” Before he could get very far, however, Kepakailiula caught up with him and swung his war club up from the ground, catching Kakaalaneo between the legs, splitting him clear to the head. Kakaalaneo made but one appeal before he died, saying: “Say, chiefs of Maui, are you then to look on unconcernedly at my death?” At this appeal the chiefs and the people jumped on Kepakailiula with the intention of killing him in payment for the death of their king, believing that they would be able to conquer Kepakailiula, but in this they were mistaken, for Kepakailiula took those who came within his reach and broke them up like [ ] small twigs before the people. This breaking of the bodies was heard at considerable distance away. He took up his opponents in his hands as though they were nothing to him. Those who faced him were killed outright and those who ran away were the only ones spared."
"A ike o Kiinoho a me Kiihele ia Kepakailiula , e kaua ana me ka lehulehu. Lele aku la laua, a haihai pu i na kanaka me Kepakailiula, hui akolu lakou.","When Kiinoho and Kiihele saw that Kepakailiula was fighting the vast multitude they came ashore and joined in the slaughter of the enemy, helping their foster son Kepakailiula, thus making three on their side."
"A ike o Kukuipahu ka makuahunowai, i ka pau loa o na kanaka o ka aina i ka make. Lalau oia ia Kapuaokeonaona, kahi wahine uuku a Kepakailiula, a holo-kiki aku la a mamua o Kepakailiula, kukulu. A hiki o Kepakailiula i kahi a Kapuaokeonaona e ku ana, lalau aku la ia i ka wahine a amo ae la, a hoi mai la i na waa, pela i pau ai ka luku ana. Haawi aku la o Kepakailiula i ka aina no Kukuipahu, oia ke ’lii nui o Maui, ma ko Kakaalaneo wahi.","When Kukuipahu, the father-in-law, saw the great destruction of the people, which meant the depopulation of the land, he took up Kapuaokeonaona, the girl wife of Kepakailiula and went ashore, then ran with all his might and stood her up in front of Kepakailiula. When Kepakailiula came up to the place where Kapuaokeonaona was standing, he took her up and carried her on his shoulders and returned to the canoes. This ended the slaughter. Kepakailiula gave the island of Maui to Kukuipahu, and made him king in place of Kakaalaneo."
"Ma keia make ana o Kakaalaneo ia Kepakailiula, ua kaulana aku la ia mea a lohe o Kakuhihewa ke ’lii o Oahu. Nolaila, makau iho la o Kakuhihewa, ia Kepakailiula.

A kau lakou i luna o na waa, holo mai la.","The news of the death of Kakaalaneo by Kepakailiula was in time carried to the hearing of Kakuhihewa, the king of Oahu, and he began to entertain fears of Kepakailiula, and in order to avoid any conflict he thought he would send his own canoes in charge of his own personal servants to Maui, to invite Kepakailiula to come to Oahu, and also to adopt him as his son and to offer to him the possession of the island of Oahu. In time the canoes set out from Oahu on their way to Maui. On account of contrary winds and a storm that came up soon after they set out, they landed at Kaunolu. That same evening, however, the wind subsided and the canoes were once more launched and they got as far as Keanapou in Kahoolawe, where they landed and spent the night. From this last place they again set sail, landing at Kapueokahi in Hana, Maui, where Kepakailiula was staying. As soon as the canoes effected a landing the voyagers went in search and inquired as to the whereabouts of Kepakailiula; they were told that his house was on the east side of the Kauiki hill. When the people from Oahu arrived at the house, they met Kepakailiula, who greeted them and they in turn extended theirs. After resting awhile they told Kepakailiula the object of their mission, saying: “We have come for you to sail for Oahu. Your father, Kakuhihewa, requests you go to Oahu and take possession of that island. The canoes are here; all you have to do is to board them and we will set sail.” Kepakailiula assented to this; whereupon he and his company, consisting of his foster fathers, Kiihele and Kiinoho, with their wife, and Makolea and Kapuaokeonaona, the wives of Kepakailiula, boarded the canoes and set sail for Oahu."
"Ma keia holo ana, punia lakou e ka ino, a haule malalo hikina o Mokuhooniki, i [ ] Molokai. Malaila aku a Kalaupapa, moe iho la a owakawaka ke kakahiaka nui. Holo mai la a pae i Waikiki ma Oahu, i laila o Kakuhihewa kahi i noho ai.","On this voyage to Oahu they were overtaken by a terrible storm and their canoes were forced to the east of Molokai, off the land known as Mokuhooniki. After a while [ ] they managed to make Kalaupapa, where they rested until dawn of the next morning, when they continued on their way and in due time landed at Waikiki, Oahu."
"Haawi mai la o Kakuhihewa ia Oahu a puni, no Kepakailiula. Haawi ae la o Kepakailiula i na makuakane, ia Kiinoho a me Kiihele ia Oahu nei. A lilo iho la laua he mau alii no Oahu a puni, noho mai la o Kakuhihewa malalo o laua.","Upon meeting Kakuhihewa gave Kepakailiula the whole of the island of Oahu to be disposed of as he saw fit. Kepakailiula then in turn gave the island over to his foster parents, Kiinoho and Kiihele; and the two became the joint rulers of Oahu, Kakuhihewa serving under them."
"Ekolu la i hala ia lakou i ka noho ana ma Waikiki, he mea mau no laila, ka heenalu ana i na la a pau loa. O Makolea kekahi ma keia heenalu ana.

During these days Makolea also joined in the sport and went out to enjoy the surf. On the fourth day Makolea went in again, but went beyond the usual place and took the surf at Kalehuawehe. The surf at this place was the most noted in those days and it is so to this day. While she was surfing, a couple of messengers from the king of Kauai arrived; they were Keaumiki and Keauka. These two were the body or personal servants of Kaikipaananea, the king of Kauai, who were on a search for a wife for their foster son, Kaikipaananea. While they were coming past Leahi, just adjoining the Mamala channel, they saw Makolea surf riding. When they first saw her they were so attracted by her good looks that they could not keep their eyes from her; on coming nearer they saw that she was indeed beautiful, having no equal. Therefore they came and took her off to Kauai to be the wife of Kaikipaananea."
"Ma keia lilo ana o Makolea i Kauai, kupu ae la ko Kepakailiula manao, e holo e imi i kana wahine i Kauai. Nolaila, nonoi aku la ia ia Kakuhihewa i waa nona e holo ai.

He therefore requested of Kakuhihewa that he be given a canoe to make the voyage. Upon hearing the wish of Kepakailiula, Kakuhihewa gave him a double canoe and some men; but Kepakailiula refused to take the men, saying: “I do not want to travel in state, for my wife has been taken away from me secretly, so I want to travel in secret. All I want from you is a small canoe.” Kakuhihewa therefore gave him a small canoe, as requested. Kepakailiula then set sail for Kauai, and on the morning of the next day he reached Waimea. As soon as he landed he took his canoe and broke it into pieces, then after this was done he went to the first house he saw, where lived one of the chiefs of Kauai, Kaunalewa by name, a very rich and honored man. When Kaunalewa saw the goodly appearance of Kepakailiula he called him, and when he arrived before him he urged that they become friends, saying: “I want you to become my friend and whatever you request of me I will grant it.”"
"Noho iho la laua a hala ekolu la, lohe ia aku la ka hauwawa o ka leo o na kanaka a me ke ’lii, nolaila, ninau aku la o Kepakailiula i ke aikane ana ia Kaunalewa: “Heaha keia hauwawa o uka?” I mai o Kaunalewa: “O ko makou alii o Kaikipaananea, e honuhonu ana, e mokomoko ana, e kui ana, a hina iho la kekahi, uwa ae la.” I aku o Kepakailiula: “Aole e pii ia aku ia wahi?” I mai ke aikane: “I ke aha hoi.” Pii aku la laua [ ] a hiki i mua o Kaikipaananea, e paapu ana na kanaka, a me na mea a pau loa. Ike mai la na mea a pau ia Kepakailiula, uwa mai la i ke kanaka maikai, a minamina iho la no ka make ia Kaikipaananea.","After they had been living together for about three days, the voices of the people and the king were heard shouting and yelling. Kepakailiula therefore asked his friend Kaunalewa: “What is this shouting up above here?” Kaunalewa replied: “It is our King Kaikipaananea playing honuhonu, also wrestling, boxing and such other games. Some one must have been thrown, hence the shouting.” Kepakailiula then said: “Can’t the place be visited?” The friend answered: “And why not?” They then went up to the place and to the very presence of Kaikipaananea surrounded by a vast multitude. When [ ] the people saw Kepakailiula they all shouted their admiration, for he was such a handsome looking fellow. After the shouting the people began to take pity on him for they were sure he would be killed by Kaikipaananea."
"Oia ko Kauai alii a puni, he ’lii ikaika loa ia i ka hakaka, a me ke kui. Aole ona mea e hina ai, oia ka oi o Kauai a puni, aohe alii, aohe koa oi ae mamua ona, nana wale no ka hina a me ke eo.

No one on the whole Island of Kauai was found who could knock him down; no chief or common warrior was found who could beat him, and in all the contests that were held he always won. Because of this fact Kaikipaananea was known as the champion of Kauai and was classed with Kakaalaneo, the king of Maui. These two kings were the most feared by the people from Hawaii to Niihau in those days, and because of this fact, chiefs and kings submissively gave their daughters to these two kings, for they feared death."
"Ike mai la o Kaikipaananea ia Kepakailiula, kahea mai la: “E! maanei ka malihini e papa wahi lealea ai me kamaaina, eia no hoi na lealea o anei. He honuhonu, he mokomoko, he kui no hoi.” I aku o Kepakailiula: “Aole au i ike i ka honuhonu,” wahi a Kaikipaananea, “ole ae la oe ia, i ka mokomoko hoi.” “Aole no wau i ike ia.” “I ke kui hoi.” “Ae, e aho au ia, ua ao iki, aole nae i ai lolo, aka, e hoao no me ke kamaaina.”","When Kaikipaananea saw Kepakailiula, he called out to him: “Say, stranger, come this way and join in the games with the sons of the soil; the honuhonu, the mokomoko, wrestling and boxing.” Kepakailiula replied: “I don’t know anything about the game of honuhonu.” Kaikipaananea said: “Not knowing that game, let it be the game of wrestling then.” “I don’t know that game even.” “Let it be boxing then.” “Yes, I believe that I can do a little of that, for I have acquired a little learning in that game, but I never was declared an expert at it. I am willing to try conclusions with the son of the soil in that game, however.”"
"No ka honuhonu: Eia ke ano o ia, he noho i lalo, a hookomo ka wawae maloko o kekahi wawae, a hoopili i ka uha. Pela na wawae a elua, ua kapa ia ia, he honuhonu.","The game of honuhonu is played by the different contestants sitting down, each facing the other, the feet are then locked and they try to throw each other over. That is called honuhonu."
"Ku ae la laua i luna. Olelo mai o Kaikipaananea: “Ia wai mua, i kamaaina i ka malihini.” I aku o Kepakailiula: “I kamaaina mua, he hope ka ka malihini.” Mahope o keia olelo ana, kui mai la o Kaikipaananea ia Kepakailiula, a kunewa, ona iho la, me ka aneane e haule ilalo.

Mahope o laila, ala mai o Kaikipaananea a olelo kaena: “Ka akahi ka ka walea, lealea, eia ka o oe ka mea e mikomiko iho ai keia kino!” [ ]","At the acceptance of the challenge to box, they both stood up facing each other. Kaikipaananea then asked of his opponent: “Who shall have the first chance? Shall it be the son of the soil or the stranger?” Kepakailiula answered: “Let the son of the soil have the first chance and the stranger the last.” As soon as this point was settled, Kaikipaananea struck at Kepakailiula, hitting him and causing him to stagger from dizziness and he almost fell to the ground. With the exception of the staggering Kepakailiula was otherwise unaffected. He then with one great effort braced himself up and in a moment he was himself again. He then struck at Kaikipaananea, hitting him and knocking him down, causing him to make water, to twist his feet and to become unconscious for a period of time sufficient for the cooking of two umus. After lying down for this length of time, Kaikipaananea came to and said boastingly: “Say, but it was fine fun! Here you have made it worth while at last.” [ ]"
"Eia nae, i ka wa i hina ai o Kaikipaananea ia Kepakailiula, uwa ka aha, a mahalo mai ia Kepakailiula i ka ikaika. Wahi a lakou: “Aohe kanaka ikaika e hina ai o Kaikipaananea, a ia oe ae nei hina.”","When Kaikipaananea was knocked down, however, the people shouted and yelled of the great strength exhibited by Kepakailiula, and all said: “No man was ever found strong enough to knock Kaikipaananea down and here you have gone and done it.”"
"Mahope o laila, hoi aku la o Kepakailiula me ke aikane, me Kaunalewa, a hiki hou i kekahi la. Pii aku la laua, hakoko no, haina lima o Kaikipaananea. Pela no ka hana ana a hala ekolu la, hoouna o Kaikipaananea i kona kanaka ia Kukaea, e hele e kukala i na mea a pau loa, e hui ma kahi hookahi e koho i ka nane a ke ’lii.","After this Kepakailiula and his friend, Kaunalewa, proceeded home. On the next day the two again went up to the grounds where the games were being held, and this time they had a wrestling match in which both arms of Kaikipaananea were broken. Three days after this encounter, Kaikipaananea sent out his servant Kukaea, to go and notify everybody to come together at the king’s palace to find the king’s riddle."
"Oia ko Kaikipaananea kanaka ponoi, o kana ai, o ka hana lepo o Kaikipaananea, a me kona hana wai, ka Kukaea ai. A nolaila, mai kona inoa o Kukaea, o kana ai no ia, a hiki i ka la i hele ai e kukala ma Kauai a puni.","Kukaea was the personal servant of Kaikipaananea; his food was the excrement of Kaikipaananea and the water he drank was the king’s urine. Because of his living on these things he was called Kukaea. This was the only food he ever tasted from his birth until the day when he was sent out to make a circuit of Kauai, to make known the king’s decree."
"Penei kana olelo kukala: “E hele na mea a pau ma kahi o ke ’lii e koho i ka nane. Ina loaa, pakele i ka umu, ina loaa ole, make i ka umu. Aohe kane e noho, aohe wahine, aohe keiki, aohe palupalu.

E hele ana e kukala i na mea a pau, e hele ma kahi o ke ’lii e koho ai i ka nane. Ina loaa, pakele ia i ka enaena o ka umu, ina loaa ole make ia i ka umu.”","The proclamation was called out in the following manner: “All the people are commanded to come to the king’s palace and solve the king’s riddle. If it is found he will be saved from the oven of hot stones; if it is not found he will be thrown to his death into the oven. No man, woman, child or those weak from old age shall remain at home; only those who do not wink when you poke your finger at their eyes . If any one remains at home on that day, his house shall be burned down and the king’s punishment shall be meted out to him, from the parents to the children, relations, and to the last connection and even to a friend. This will be the punishment meted out to any person who remains at home this day.” In the course of the journey taken by Kukaea, to issue the king’s decree, he came to the house where Kepakailiula was living, still calling out the king’s proclamation at the top of his voice. When Kepakailiula heard the call he asked his friend: “Who is this man that is making that call?” The friend replied: “It is Kukaea, the personal servant of Kaikipaananea. He is on his way calling everybody to come to the king’s palace to solve the king’s riddle. If a person gives the right answer he will be saved, but if he makes a mistake he will be thrown to his death into the oven of hot stones.”"
"A lohe o Kepakailiula i keia olelo, i aku ia i ke aikane: “Hea ia aku hoi ha, e hele mai maanei?” “Ka he kanaka ino, he pilo, no ka mea, he kukae kana ai.” Wahi a Kepakailiula: “E kahea aku oe, he makemake au e ike ia ia.” No keia olelo a Kepakailiula, kahea aku la o Kaunalewa ia ia. “Hele mai maanei.” Hele mai la o Kukaea a kokoke, [ ] i mai la: “Aole au e pono ke hele aku i laila, he ino au e ku aku la, he pilo, no ka mea, he kukae ka’u ai a hiki i keia la.” Kahea mai o Kepakailiula: “Hele mai, mai makau oe, a hopohopo.” A hiki o Kukaea, i aku o Kepakailiula: “E hamama ko waha.” A hamama ka waha o Kukaea a ninini iho la o Kepakailiula i ka wai, maloko a ma waho o ke kino, a pau iho la ke pilo o kona kino.

Eia ua nane la, elua nane, elua haina.”","When Kepakailiula heard this, he said to his friend: “Then call him to come this way.” “But he is unfit to be seen; he smells bad, for he eats nothing but the king’s excrement.” Kepakailiula, however, insisted, telling his friend: “You call him to come here, for I wish to see him.” Because of this wish Kaunalewa called out to Kukaea to come. Kukaea then turned toward them and when at some distance away, he said: “It [ ] is not proper for me to come any nearer, for I am not fit for your company; I smell bad, for I have had nothing else for food except the king’s excrement, to this day.” Kepakailiula, however, called out to him: “Come here, don’t be afraid or have any fear.” When Kukaea came up Kepakailiula asked him: “Open your mouth?” Kukaea then opened his mouth and Kepakailiula poured water into his mouth and on his body and told him to wash himself and be rid of the foul odor of his body. Kepakailiula then gave him some kapas and a loin cloth, and set food and meat before him. Kukaea then sat down and ate until he was satisfied. When he finished his meal, he turned and said to Kepakailiula: “What shall I give you as payment for this great kindness? Here I have lived from my birth to this day with my king and have just completed the circuit of Kauai, but no one has ever given me food to eat. I have at last found that food and meat are indeed pleasant to the taste. Therefore here is what I shall give you in return for your kindness. I will give you the answer to the king’s riddle, for I am the only person that knows the answer. The riddle is this: it is divided into two parts and therefore has two answers:"
"Kai a puni, Kai a lalo, Koe koena. O kanaka i ku, O kanaka i moe, O kanaka i pelupelu ia.","Plaited all around, Plaited to the bottom, Leaving an opening. The men that stand, The men that lie down, The men that are folded."
"Eia ka haina o ka nane mua. “He hale. Ako ia a puni o luna me lalo, a koe ka puka. Eia ka lua o ka haina o ka nane. He hale no.

A pau ka hai ana, alaila, lalau aku au ia Kaikipaananea a kiola i loko o ka umu.” I aku o Kepakailiula: “E hoi oe a i pololi, iho mai ianei e ai ai.” A hiki i ka ha o ka la, akoakoa na mea a pau loa ma kahi o ke ’lii, ia manawa, hiki o Kepakailiula ma kahi o Kaikipaananea.","“The answer to the first part is ‘house.’ The house is plaited all around and from top to bottom and an opening is left, the door. The answer to the second half is also ‘house.’ The sticks are made to stand, the battens are laid down and the grass and cords are folded. This is the answer to the king’s riddle. On the approach of that day, however, you come and stand in the presence of the people and when you see that the oven is sufficiently heated, for I shall be the one who shall attend to it, when you see that it is well heated, you give the answer to the first half. And when you see that the stones are being flattened out and some are taken out and placed on the edge, you give the answer to the second half, and then you take hold of Kaikipaananea and throw him into the oven.” Kepakailiula then said to the man: “You go home now, and when you get hungry come down here and have something to eat.” On the fourth day after the incidents related above, the people all gathered together at the king’s palace, when Kepakailiula also came."
"Ike mai la o Kaikipaananea, kahea mai la: “E ka malihini, maanei e walea ai. Eia ka lealea o keia la, he nanenane.

Ina i loaa, a ina i loaa ole. Ua maopopo no ka hoopai, he kalua i ka umu. Eia a’u nane. Nane akahi:","When Kaikipaananea saw Kepakailiula, he called out to him, saying: “Say, stranger, come here and join the contest. The sport today consists in the giving and answering of riddles. Whoever shall find my riddle shall be spared from the oven of heated stones; but if the answer shall be wrong, he shall be thrown to his death into the oven.” Kepakailiula then said: “Let the king give his riddle so that the people will know what [ ] it is. If it is not answered correctly the punishment is already known, that is, it will be death in the oven.” The king then answered: “Here is the first half of my riddle:"
"Nana aku la o Kepakailiula i ka enaena o ka umu. A enaena. Hai aku la ia i ka nane mua. “He hale. Ako ia ka hale a puni, a koe koena, he puka.” Nana hou o Kepakailiula, o ka ulu o ka umu.

Lele o Kukaea haihai pu i na kanaka, pela no hoi o Kaunalewa ke aikane a Kepakailiula, akolu lakou.","All this time Kepakailiula had his eye on the oven and when he saw that it was sufficiently heated, he gave the answer to the first half, saying: “It is a ‘house.’ The house is plaited all around from top to bottom and an opening is left for the door.” Kepakailiula again looked at the oven, and when he saw that the stones were being placed on the edge, he gave the answer to the second half, saying: “The answer to the second half is also ‘house.’ The posts of a house are first made to stand up, then the battens are laid down and then the grass and cords are folded and fastened down.” At this Kaikipaananea asked him: “Who has informed you of the answer to my riddle?” While he was asking the question, he was caught and thrown into the oven and Kukaea held him down. While he was being held in the umu, he called out to the chiefs and warriors of Kauai, saying: “Say, are you then to look on unconcernedly while I am being put to death?” The chiefs and warriors of Kauai then jumped on Kepakailiula and attempted to kill him, Kepakailiula then took them as they came and broke them like twigs. Kukaea and Kaunalewa also jumped in and helped Kepakailiula, thus making three on their side."
"Ma keia pepehi ana, aohe alii koe, aohe kanaka pakele i ka make. O ka poe wale no i holo ke pakele.",In this slaughter not a single chief or warrior who opposed the three was spared; all were killed. Those who ran away were the only ones who escaped.
"Loaa aku la o Makolea, lawe mai la o Kepakailiula a noho iho la i kahi o ke aikane o Kaunalewa. Olelo aku la o Kepakailiula ia Kaunalewa: “O oe ke ’lii o Kauai a puni, o oe maluna a ma lalo, mauka, a makai, ka moa a me ka maka. O ka noho alii wale no kau maluna o ka aina. A o Kukaea, malalo mai ia ou, o oe maluna.”","After the fight Makolea was found and Kepakailiula took her to the home of his friend. Kepakailiula then said to his friend, Kaunalewa: “You shall be the king of the whole of Kauai. You shall be the king of the things above it and the things below it, the things in the uplands and the lowlands, the things that are cooked and uncooked. You shall be the ruler of the land and Kukaea shall rule under you.”"
"A pau ae la ke kauoha a Kepakailiula, hoi mai laua i Oahu nei me Makolea. [ ]","After giving these orders, Kepakailiula and Makolea returned to Oahu. [ ]"
"He kanaka ikaika o Aiohikupua i ke kui a me ka mokomoko. Ia ia i holo ai mai Maui aku a pae ma Kauhola i Kohala, e mokomoko ana o Hinakahua. Kahi o na kanaka a pau e piha ana. Ilaila o Ihuanu, he kanaka ikaika no Kohala i ke kui.","Aiohikupua was a very strong man, both in boxing and wrestling. When he set sail from Maui and landed at Kauhola, in Kohala, he found the people gathered at Hinakahua, where they were holding their customary games of boxing, wrestling and other manly exhibitions of strength. At this place he met Ihuanu, a very expert and strong boxer who belonged to that district, Kohala."
"A pae o Aiohikupua ma Kohala, pii aku la lakou e ike i ka mokomoko.

He keu oe o ke kanaka wahahee, heaha la oe i kuu manao.”","When Aiohikupua and his companions came ashore in Kohala they proceeded up to see the wrestling. When they arrived at the grounds, Ihuanu came out and challenged: “Who is to come from that side and meet me, wrestling?” No one was seen to come and accept the challenge because they were all afraid of him. After this Ihuanu turned to Aiohikupua and said: “Say, stranger, you had better join in the fun.” When Aiohikupua heard the invitation he went up to Ihuanu and said: “Say, son of the soil, you have asked me to join you in the fun, and this is what I wish to say to you: Get two others beside yourself on your side, making three of you. With that number the stranger will feel it worth while to join you.” When Ihuanu heard this from Aiohikupua, he made reply: “You are a very conceited man. I am the best man among all the people of Kohala, and here you have asked that there must be three of us on one side to meet you alone on your side. You are the most conceited man that I have ever seen. What are you to me?”"
"I aku o Aiohikupua i kana olelo kaena i mua o Ihuanu: “Aole au e ku aku ana e kui me oe, ke ku ole mai oukou ekolu i mua o’u.

And what do I care for you and the people that have gathered here? I can turn this crowd into nothing with my left hand.” Because of these words of Aiohikupua, one of the strong men in Kohala who had come to witness the games came up behind Aiohikupua and said to him: “Say, don’t get Ihuanu angry, for he is the strongest man in Kohala; there is nothing kept away from him when he asks.” At this Aiohikupua pushed him to one side whereby the man was killed. Upon seeing this, one of the warriors came up behind Ihuanu and said to him: “Say, Ihuanu, we see that our side will not be victorious this day. I am sure the stranger will win out, because one of our companions is killed by just receiving a mere push. Therefore I beg of you that the crowd be dispersed and the games brought to an end and you withdraw your challenge and meet the stranger in a kindly way and shake hands, and in that way save yourself.” By these words the hot anger in Ihuanu was [ ] rekindled, and so he replied: “Say, my men, don’t be afraid because of the death of that man from the push he received. Did I not do the very same thing some few days ago? Then why should you all be afraid? But if you are afraid, then go and hide your faces in the sky; and if you should hear that Ihuanu is victorious, remember it was by the blow known as Kanikapihe, the blow the teacher has not instructed you of, for I see he will not be able to overcome me, for I hear the end of my loin cloth snap behind me.” His companions then said to him: “We have nothing more to say to you, we have done our part. Stand up then and face your opponent; perhaps you will be saved by means of the blow your teacher has not instructed us of, and perhaps the end of your loin cloth did tell you the truth.” With this the companions of Ihuanu retired to the outer edge of the crowd."
"Ia Ihuanu e olelo kaena ana i mua o ka aha, oili mai la o Aiohikupua a ma ke alo o Ihuanu ku iho la, a upoipoi na lima, me ka olelo aku ia Ihuanu: “E Ihuanu, kui ia i kuu piko a pololei, i eha kauna kui.” (Ua like me umikumamaono puupuu.)

I will therefore at this time say, that my god is able to give me the victory over your strong man this day and to make his head a plaything for my canoe men.” After making the above remarks, he prayed to his god as follows:"
"Lanipipili, Lanioaka, Lanikahuliomealani, E Hekilikaakaa, E Nakolowailani, E ike i ka oukou pulapula, E nana i ka oukou Kama, E haawi mai ke poo o Ihuanu I ike keia aha apau loa, Owau ka lanakila maluna, Amama, ua noa.","Lanipipili, Lanioaka, Lanikahuliomealani.

I want you to strike at me.” When the boxing teacher of Ihuanu heard what his pupil had answered he came up to his side and said to him: “If he should again ask you to strike him do it, because this is the proper time.” Shortly after this Aiohikupua again requested of Ihuanu to strike him. At this request, Ihuanu let drive at his opponent but did not hit him, for [ ] Aiohikupua was on his guard and dodged. After dodging this blow from Ihuanu, Aiohikupua struck at his opponent, hitting him just below the chest so strong that the fist of Aiohikupua went clear through and came out at the back. Aiohikupua then raised up his arm, with the body of Ihuanu on it, twirled the body around over his head and then threw it outside of the rows of people that were standing around. At sight of this great strength a mighty shout came from the people and after this they began to disperse. After this Aiohikupua went over to the place where the body of Ihuanu was lying and cut off his head and took it to his canoe men , and they all returned to their double canoe, which they boarded and set sail for Hamakua, landing at Paauhau."
"O ko Paauhau kanaka oi ia i ke kui a me ka mokomoko, he kanaka ikaika loa ma ia hana. A ua laha ae kona kaulana a puni o Hamakua.","Haunaka was the strongest man, in boxing and wrestling, in the whole of Paauhau and he was at this time very famous. In fact his fame had traversed over the whole district of Hamakua."
"Ia lakou e piha ana ma Paauhau, lele aku la o Aiohikupua a pae i uka.

As soon as he arrived, Haunaka called out to him: “Come here.” When Aiohikupua came in the presence of Haunaka, he said: “You will never be able to hurt the boy from Kauai for he is like the branch of a tree that stands on the side of a cliff.” While Aiohikupua was saying this one of the men who had seen him in Kohala came up and said to Haunaka: “Say, Haunaka and the company gathered here, this is the very man who struck Ihuanu, in Kohala, and killed him. This man’s blow is sharp like the point of a spear; you people will therefore have no chance against him.” When Haunaka heard this he came up to Aiohikupua and extended his greetings. At the conclusion of the games Aiohikupua returned to his canoe and set sail for Hilo, on his way in search of his lover, Laieikawai."
"O Kihanuilulumoku, he ’kua ia no Kahalaomapuana ma, i Paliuli kahi i noho ai. He oi kona waha i ka nui a me ke akea, e pa ka lehelehe luna i ka lani, a o ka lehelehe lalo i ka honua.

When opened the upper lip would touch the heaven while the lower lip touched the ground. This god was very powerful and nothing could overcome him. He was also very brave and he was placed as the watchman at Paliuli, where Laieikawai was residing."
"O ka nui o na waa o Aiohikupua ma keia holo ana, he iwakalua kaulua, elua kanaha [ ] kaukahi, he kanaha waa peleleu nui, a he mau waa ohua ka nui.

"A mahope o ka pae ana o na waa o Aiohikupua ma Keaau, pii aku la ia me kona kuhina i Paliuli e nana ia Laieikawai. A hiki o Aiohikupua me kona kuhina i Paliuli, e noho ana na kaikuahine o Aiohikupua, he mau kiai no Laieikawai.","The number of canoes on this expedition under the command of Aiohikupua, was [ ] twenty double canoes, eighty single canoes and forty large war canoes, besides several single ones carrying the servants. Aiohikupua had a large army with him on this expedition and with him were several chiefs. These warriors were all well armed and Aiohikupua had with him his man-eating dog, called Kalahumoku."
"Olelo mai la lakou: “E Aiohikupua, e hoi oe ano, he kapu o uka nei.” Hoopaa aku o Aiohikupua.

When they arrived at Paliuli, they saw the sisters of Aiohikupua guarding Laieikawai. When the sisters saw their brother, they said to him: “Say, Aiohikupua, you must go back at once for a kapu has been placed over this place.” Aiohikupua would not listen to this order, but insisted on staying. Kahalaomapuana then said to him: “If you insist on remaining here you will be killed.” When Aiohikupua heard this he turned and went back, filled with bitter anger. When he reached Keaau he ordered ten men to go up and put his sisters to death."
"Ia Aiohikupua e olelo ana i na kanaka e pii, ike mai la o Waka, ke kupunawahine o Laieikawai i keia hana a Aiohikupua. Hai aku la o Waka ia Kahalaomapuana, ko Laieikawai kuhina nui, a lohe ia, pule aku la ia ia Kihanuilulumoku, penei:","While Aiohikupua was giving his orders to the men, Waka, the grandmother of Laieikawai, by her supernatural powers, was aware of what Aiohikupua was up to, so she told the facts to Kahalaomapuana, the chief adviser of Laieikawai. When she heard this she prayed to Kihanuilulumoku as follows:"
"E Kihanuilulumoku, Ko makou akua mana, Nana ia ke kupu, Ka eu o ka aina nei la, Pepehi ia a make, A holo ke olohelohe, E ao nae oe ia Kalahumoku, I ka ilio aikanaka a Aiohikupua, Hemahema oe pau kakou, Kulia ko ikaika a pau i luna, Amama, ua noa, lele wale.","Say, Kihanuilulumoku, Our all powerful god; Watch for the enemy, The mischievous people of the land, And put them to death Sparing none. Be watchful however of Kalahumoku, The man-eating dog of Aiohikupua. If you are careless we are lost; Let all your strength be at your command. It is ended, the kapu is removed."
"Ia po a wanaao, hiki na koa he umi i uka, me ke kuhina o Aiohikupua. Mahope o ko lakou hiki ana i Paliuli, nehe ana ka laau a me ka makani i ke alelo o Kihanuilulumoku.

After their arrival the trees were heard to be rustling and the wind began to moan, caused by the tongue of Kihanuilulumoku. After they had advanced along the way they got further and further into the middle of the mouth of the lizard [god, Kihanuilulumoku], the upper jaw then came down and the men were shut up in the mouth and were swallowed; no one escaped to carry the tidings to Aiohikupua."
"Elua la i hala o ke kali ana o Aiohikupua, aohe hoi mai o kela poe, nolaila, hoouna aku la ia he iwakalua poe koa loa ona, e pii e pepehi i na kaikuahine. Pii aku la, lakou a hiki, hamo mai la no ka moo pau i ka ai ia.","After waiting for two days for the return of his men, Aiohikupua again sent up more men, twenty of the best of his warriors, and orders were given them to go and put his sisters to death. When the men reached Paliuli the lizard caught and ate them all."
"Kakali hou ke ’lii, a hala hou he la, hoouna hou i na koa he kanaha ka nui, a hiki no i uka, pau no i ka make i ka moo. Ma keia hoi ole mai o na koa, kupu ae la ko Aiohikupua [ ] manao e hoouna i kana mau elele mama loa, i maopopo ke kumu o ka hoi ole ana mai i kai nei.","The chief waited until the expiration of one day, when he again sent up more men, forty warriors, and on their arrival at Paliuli, the lizard killed these also. Because [ ] of the continued absence of his men the thought entered Aiohikupua to dispatch his fleetest messengers to find out the cause of the non-return of his men."
"O laua na elele mama a Aiohikupua.

While they were going along the road they met a man who inquired: “Where are you two going?” They replied: “We are going up to see about our people, for they have not returned .” The man said: “They have been killed by the man-eating lizard who lives up here, called Kihanuilulumoku.” At the conclusion of this conversation, the two messengers continued on their way up. Not very long after this they heard the rustling of the leaves and the low murmuring of the wind, which reminded them of the conversation they just had with the man. The two messengers then changed themselves into the form of birds and flew up. When they reached a good ways up they looked about them and saw that the rays of the sun were hidden, and in looking to see the cause of this they saw it was the upper jaw of the mouth of the lizard. At sight of this they continued flying until they reached a point above the jaw. From this position they looked down and saw the trees and earth uprooted as though a large oo was tearing up the ground, causing them to tremble because of its terribleness. By what they saw they made sure that all their men had been killed by the lizard. The two then returned to Aiohikupua and related what they had seen. When Aiohikupua heard this he sent for Kalahumoku, his man-eating dog."
"He ilio ai kanaka o Kalahumoku no Kahiki mai. Elua ano, he ’kua, he kanaka. He ilio mana, he ilio ikaika loa ma ka hakaka ana.","Kalahumoku was a man-eating dog from Kahiki. He had two natures, that of a god and that of a human being. As a dog he had supernatural powers and was possessed of very great strength in fighting."
"I aku o Aiohikupua, e pii oe e pepehi i ka moo a make, alaila, luku oe i o’u mau kaikuahine a pau i ka make. A pau ka Aiohikupua olelo, hai aku ka ilio i kona manao, i na ’lii a me na kanaka a pau loa, penei:","When the dog came into his presence Aiohikupua said: “You go up and kill the lizard, and after that go and kill all my sisters.” After Aiohikupua had issued these orders the dog then turned and addressed the chiefs and all the men as follows:"
"E nana oukou i uka, I pii ka ohu a pololei i luna, A hina ka ohu ma ka lulu, Ua halawai au me Kihanuilulumoku, Manao ae oukou ua hoaikane maua, A i hina ka ohu i ka makani, Ua hakaka maua, Alaila, pule oukou i ke ’kua ia Lanipipili.

But if the fog should lean toward the windward Know that we are being engaged in battle; Then you must pray to the god Lanipipili. After that look again and if you should see the fog lean toward the sea, here, [ ] Know that the lizard has won out. But if, however, the fog should lean toward the mountain Know that I have defeated the lizard, And I have conquered over it. Therefore, you must continue praying for me."
"A hiki o Kalahumoku i uka o Paliuli, e moe ana ka moo, nolaila, hala ka moo mahope nei, kaa loa ka ilio i kahi o na kiai e noho ana.","When Kalahumoku arrived at Paliuli, he found the lizard sleeping, so he continued on up leaving the lizard behind him and after some time he came to the place where the guards were stationed."
"A no ka hohono o ka ilio puoho ae la o Kihanuilulumoku, a ala ae la, hanu aku la a loaa o Kalahumoku.

Pau na pepeiao a mumuku, moku ka huelo.","Shortly after this the lizard, Kihanuilulumoku, smelt the dog and so it awoke from its sleep and followed on after Kalahumoku until they met. Kihanuilulumoku then opened wide its mouth to bite, when Kalahumoku showed its sharp teeth. The two then jumped at each other and a terrible battle was fought, biting one another. Not very long after this the lizard conquered over Kalahumoku; his ears were cut off and his tail was bitten off short."
"Ia laua ala e kaua ana, he mea mau ia Aiohikupua ma, ka nana i ka ohu. Pii ae la ka ohu a pololei i luna, moe i kai, manao iho la no o Aiohikupua, ua pio o Kalahumoku.","While the two were engaged in this conflict, Aiohikupua and his men watched the fog. They saw it rise up straight, and after it had reached some distance in the sky, it leaned toward the sea, which caused Aiohikupua to think that Kalahumoku was defeated."
"Mahope o laila, hoi mai la ka ilio a hiki, i nana aku ka hana, ua mumuku na pepeiao, ua poomoku ka huelo. Pau ae la ka manao i ka noho, nolaila, hoi mai la lakou ma na waa i Kauai, me ka loaa ole o Laieikawai. Pela iho la ka make hewa o ko Aiohikupua manao pepehi i kona mau kaikuahine. [ ]","Sometime after this the dog arrived and when they looked at it they saw that its ears were cut off and the tail was cut off short. This ended the desire of Aiohikupua to stay in Puna and he and his men boarded their canoes and returned to Kauai, without obtaining Laieikawai. Thus was the plan of Aiohikupua to kill his sisters defeated. [ ]"
"Ua kaulana loa ia no kona maalea i ka hoopunipuni, a me kona lele ana. He ’kua o Wakaina, aohe kino maoli, a he olelo nahenahe loa kana mau olelo. Me he kanaka alelo pelu la, ke kamailio ana.

Wakaina was a ghost; he did not possess a real human body, but he could be very cunning and use words of deception in whispers. The sound of his voice was like that of a person whose tongue was twisted. It was in Waiapuka, in North Kohala, a place adjoining Niulii, where Wakaina sang and deceived the people."
"I ke kakahiaka nui, i ka wa a ka la i puka mai ai, lele ae la o Wakaina i luna me ka hulahula me kana mau olelo mele ma ka waha, penei: “I lea no ka hula i ka ahuula,” hookupu keia poe i ka ahuula.","Early one morning just as the sun was coming up, Wakaina flew up and began singing, using these words: “One can sing beautifully when one has a feather cloak.”"
"“I lea no ka hula i ka mahiole,” hookupu keia poe i ka mahiole.","The people who heard this brought out their feather cloaks and gave them to the ghost. The ghost then sang, saying: “One can sing beautifully when one has a feather helmet.”"
"“I lea no ka hula i ka hulili,” hookupu keia poe i ka hulili.",The people again brought out their feather helmets and gave them to the ghost. Again the ghost sang: “One can sing beautifully when one has a bambu flute.”
"“I lea no ka hula i ka pa-u,” hookupu keia poe i ka pa-u.",The people also gave their bambu flutes. The ghost then said: “One can sing beautifully when one has a pa-u (skirt).” The women gave the ghost their skirts.
"Pela no ka hookupu ana, a pau na mea a pau loa ia Wakaina; alaila, hoolelele ae la ia me ka hula. Nana ae la na mea a pau loa a akaaka iho la. Ia wa, lele loa o Wakaina a pane iho i nei huaolelo. “A lele au la, hokahoka wale iho.”","This was continued until everything had been given to Wakaina, who then hopped up and down dancing with delight. When the people saw this they were amused and laughed. When Wakaina saw the people laughing he flew away saying: “I will now fly away and you people will be ashamed of yourselves.”"
"He kanaka akamai loa o Kapunohu i ka pu a me ka nanenane. Ua kaapuni hele ia ia Hawaii a puni, a ua nui ka poe i eo ia ia.",Kapunohu was a very smart man in the giving and solving of riddles. It was said that he made several trips around Hawaii competing with others and many were the victories he gained.
"Hoi aku la o Kapunohu, noonoo hou iho la laua, a hana hou iho la i kekahi mea. I aku ke kaikuaana i ke kaikaina: “E!

After studying for a time the older brother said to the younger brother: “Say, if Kapunohu makes us another visit, we will then dip our fingers into the gravy of the fish-bowl, reach out for the food and eat.” The younger brother assented to this."
"A hele hou mai la o Kapunohu i kahi o laua nei. Ike laua nei, lalau i ka ipukai me ka ai, a ai iho la, me ka penu o na lima i loko o ke kai o ka ipukai.

When they saw him coming, they took up their calabashes and uncovered them and then began their meal, dipping their fingers into the gravy, licking their fingers and taking some poi. When Kapunohu saw this he said: “Here you are eating your food, but where is your fish?” The two replied: “We are eating the food and the fish is human flesh.” Kapunohu replied: “You two are deceiving yourselves. How can you make out that you are eating human flesh?” The two, however, insisted that what they said was indeed the truth. After much discussion wagers were made, and when this was settled one of the brothers said: “The food is of course plain enough; but the fish is our fingers, for we are dipping our fingers into the gravy without fish, therefore, the fish is human flesh.” Kapunohu admitted that he was indeed beaten, saying: “You two have won.” [ ]"
"O ka mua o Waawaaikinaauao, o ka muli o Waawaaikinaaupo. Hookahi o laua makuakane, hookahi makuahine. O ka laua hana o ke kawili manu.",Waawaaikinaauao was the elder and Waawaaikinaaupo was the younger. They were born of the same father and mother. Their occupation was the snaring of birds.
"Mamua ae o ko laua pii ana e kawili manu, olelo aku ke kaikuaana i ke kaikaina, penei: “Ina kaua e pii i ke kawili manu, a i loaa ka manu ia oe, ua puka ka ihu, o ka’u manu ia, mai lawe oe. Hoihoi mai oe na’u ia, o ka manu i puka ole ka ihu, o kau ia.” Ae aku ke kaikaina.","Once upon a time, just prior to their going up to the woods to snare birds, the older brother addressed the younger brother, saying: “When we get up into the woods today to snare birds and you should catch any of them having holes in their beaks, those are my birds; do not take them. You must give me those birds and the birds without holes in the beak are yours to keep for yourself.” The younger brother assented to this."
"Ia manawa, pii laua i ke kawili manu, a loaa ka manu, ua puka ka ihu, haawi no i ke kaikuaana. Pela no ko laua hana mau ana, a nele loa o Waawaaikinaaupo i ka manu, pau loa i kona kaikuaana lokoino, aloha ole.

Every time the younger brother caught birds he would examine their beak and finding the holes he would turn them over to his brother. This was kept up for the whole day, and not being able to catch any birds without holes in the beak, the younger brother, Waawaaikinaaupo, had to come home without any birds, while the unkind brother had them all. Therefore these names were given these boys as a result of their practices. Waawaaikinaauao meaning Waawaaiki-the-smart-one, and Waawaaiki-naaupo meaning the foolish one."
"He kanaka akamai o Lepe i ka hoopunipuni i ke ’kua, a he maalea loa ma ka olelo ana. No Hilo, Waiakea, o Lepe.","Lepe was a very deceiving fellow who once successfully deceived the ghosts. He was very quick-witted and cunning. Lepe belonged to Waiakea, Hilo."

This ghost happened to be baldheaded. When Lepe looked up and saw the baldheaded ghost, he called out: “As the drum was beating, up came a baldhead; had there only been two, what a beautiful sight it would be.” The ghost replied: “If that is what you want, Lepe, you can have two.” At this up came another baldheaded ghost. Lepe then repeated what he had said, adding another ghost, until ten baldheaded ghosts stood on the cliff. With this number, Lepe addressed them saying: “Say, you must be hungry?” “Yes, we are hungry.” Lepe again said: “Then wait here while I go home and bring the remnants of my last meal.” Lepe then returned to the house, took up the calabash and excreted into it, then he urinated into the calabash and stirred up the mixture with a stick. He then took up the coconut shell dish containing some salt and went back to the place where the ghosts were waiting for him, carrying the calabash and the salt dish. When Lepe came up to the ghosts, they took the calabash and stuck their fingers into it and ate the food, and said: “Oh, my, how bad this food does smell and how awfully bitter it is!” Lepe replied: “You see I am all alone by myself, and being alone, I eat my food from the time it is fresh and sweet until it turns sour on me, before I finish it. If I had such a large company as you are with me, why the food would be finished while it is still fresh, and it would not turn sour in the calabash.” With this the ghosts continued on eating until the whole mixture in the calabash was finished. After the mixture had been consumed, Lepe called out: “Serve you right, you have all eaten the dung of Lepe.” When the ghosts heard this, they all became angry with Lepe, and said: “We are going [ ] to kill you for this.” Lepe replied: “If you should kill me you will not have anybody to play with.”"
"I aku o Lepe: “E pee oukou, e huna wau.” Ae mai la ke ’kua. Nolaila, hele aku la o Lepe a ke one, kikio iho la, a hoopuupuu ae la i ke one, a hana aku la he mau awe he umi, a pau i ka hanaia.

Hoole aku o Lepe, ina wau e make ia oukou, aole oukou hoa paani.","[Some time after this] Lepe again conspired against the ghosts and upon meeting them said: “You fellows cover up your eyes while I go and hide something.” The ghosts assented to this, and Lepe proceeded to the sand, and after excreting on the sand he covered it up making a small hill of sand; then he led ten arms from the hill, after which he called to the ghosts, saying: “It is hidden.” The ghosts then all came and Lepe said to them: “The game is this: here are ten different arms leading to that hill; each of you take an arm and dig with all your might towards that hill; whoever gets there first, wins.” The ghosts began digging and when they reached the hill their hands were all besmeared with the filth. This made the ghosts more angry with Lepe and they all spoke of killing him. Again Lepe told them that if they were to put him to death they would be without a playmate."
"Nolaila, ohumu iho la ke ’kua, me ka manao e imi i mea e make ai o Lepe.

After some time they decided that they would kill a pig and give a feast, as a means of tempting Lepe to come to their house, where they would kill him. As soon as this was decided on, they immediately proceeded to carry out their plans."

Ei ae no nae mahope mai lakou, he hiki mai koe.”","While they were preparing the pig for the umu, Lepe saw them in their preparations and knew that a feast was about to be given; he therefore began to evolve a plan whereby he would be able to eat some of the pork. After hitting on a plan he went to work to carry it out and so procured some charcoal and began to blacken one side of his body from top to bottom, leaving one side. When this was completed he went up to the house where the ghosts made their home. As he was drawing near the house, one of the ghosts said: “Say, that fellow looks like Lepe, only this fellow is black on one side.” Another ghost said: “That fellow is not Lepe for he is black on one side, Lepe is different.” When Lepe arrived, the ghosts asked him: “Are you the only one who has come?” Lepe replied: “No, there are ten of us black fellows. I am the tenth, and the other nine fellows have not come yet, but they are coming later on, however; they will be here directly.”"
"A moa ka puaa, ai iho la lakou me Lepe, a pau ka ai ana, hele aku la o Lepe a mamao mai kahi mai o ke ’kua. Kahea aku la o Lepe: “Akola! pau ka puaa a oukou ia Lepe.

After the meal, Lepe got up and went away, and when he was at some distance from the house, he called out: “I have fooled you. Lepe has eaten of your pig. I am Lepe.” One of the ghosts then said to the others: “We have been deceived by Lepe. Here it turns out that this black man is Lepe after all.” The ghosts then began chasing Lepe with the idea of killing him because they were very angry. While they were chasing, Lepe ran to his house and began calling out in a loud voice: “Say, you people who are sleeping, you must wake up for here are some people coming who wish to kill us.” With this he reached and took hold of the end of a cord and pulled on it. To this cord several rattlers were fastened and when he gave a pull the rattlers made quite an uproar. When the ghosts heard this queer noise they all ran away calling out to themselves: “Say, we will be killed. Here, Lepe’s house is full of people all the time and we did not know it. What a narrow escape we have had. Let us get away from him.” And they kept on running. [ ]"

A nolaila mai keia inoa o Maiauhaalenalenaupena.","Maiauhaalenalenaupena was a very great deceiver and often deceived the peddlers and appropriated their goods without giving anything in return. The way he did this was as follows: In the winter, when the sea was very rough and the wind and rain lasted for months at a time, upon seeing the people from the uplands coming down to the beach with food, sugar-cane, bananas, gourds and other things, he would take up his fish nets and paddle and place them in his canoe, then push out the canoe, into the sea, and would then return and proceed to dry out the nets, making believe that he had just returned from fishing. This was how he came by the name of Maiauhaalenalenaupena."
"A ike ka maauauwa he ano lawaia, alaila, haawi aku la i ka ai a me ka ia, na mea a pau loa, a hoaie aku la, me ka manao e loaa mai ka ia mahope.

In this way the peddlers lost all their goods."
"Oia kekahi o na kanaka hoopunipuni i oi aku mamua o na hoopunipuni a pau loa. No Kawaihae i Kohala, Hawaii, o Kuauamoa. Ia ia i noho ai i Kawaihae kai, ua maa ia i ka olelo a na haole, a Aikake me Olohana.","Kuauamoa too was a very great deceiver, in fact he was the greatest of them all. Kuauamoa belonged to Kawaihae, in Kohala, Hawaii. While he was living on the beach at Kawaihae, he came in contact with some white men such as Isaac Davis and John Young, and in this way learned how to use certain English words."

Upon meeting the men Kuauamoa asked them: “What are you going to do with the rope?” “We are going to sell it to the white men.” Kuauamoa then asked them: “Do you know how to speak English so that you will be able to make good bargains?” “No.” “Well, I will teach you a few words of their language so that you will be able to effect a satisfactory sale. When you come to the place of the white men, Isaac and All Hands, and they should ask you what the rope is for, you tell them, ‘ Ko kame alaki, ko kahele ia paka. ’ If they should ask you another question, say to them, ‘ Kaukau ikeke i keke mea ai! ’ These are the words to effect a ready sale of the rope of you two if offered; keep them fast in mind lest you forget and suffer loss.”"

Upon seeing this, the men dropped the rope and ran away for they were sore afraid, until they reached Kohala, leaving their rope behind which was appropriated by the white men."

Hanaaumoe was a very cunning ghost. His duties consisted in the watching all the sea coast for the coming of canoes to Oahu. While he was on duty one day, Kahaookamoku, a chief of Kauai, was seen off shore with several canoes and men. When they arrived off Mamala, where Hanaaumoe was on the watch, he called out: “Where are your canoes sailing to?” Holoholopinaau, the prophet or seer, answered: “We are sailing to Hawaii on a trip of sightseeing.” Hanaaumoe said: “You must not go to Hawaii for that island is inhabited by ghosts."
Akua Hawaii. Akua ia Kanikaa. Akua Maui. Akua ia Kaahualii. Akua Lanai. Akua ia Pahulu. Akua Molokai. Akua ia Kahiole.,"Hawaii has ghosts, it is inhabited by Kanikaa. Maui has ghosts, it is inhabited by Kaahualii. Lanai has ghosts, it is inhabited by Pahulu. Molokai has ghosts, it is inhabited by Kahiole."
"“Eia no ka moku akua ole la o Oahu nei. O ka moku o Halalii. E pae he ai no o uka, he hale no, he wai auau no, he mau wahine no.

Come ashore, we have food ashore, we have houses, we have fresh water to bathe in and we also have women. The canoe men can have as many as two or three, while your chief, Kahaookamoku shall have five, therefore you must come ashore.” The chief Kahaookamoku gave his consent, and he and his men came ashore."
"He alii o Halalii no Oahu nei i loko o ia wa, he ’kua nae, a he ’kua wale no kanaka e noho ana ia wa. A he ’kua hoi o Hanaaumoe, nolaila, aohe kanaka ola ke pae mai ianei, pau i ka ai ia e Halalii ma. Nolaila, i noho ai o Hanaaumoe ma na Lae kahakai a pau o Oahu nei, e nana i kanaka ai na lakou.","Halalii was at this time the king of Oahu, but he was a ghost and all the inhabitants of the island at that time were ghosts. Hanaaumoe was also a ghost and because of this fact no human beings lived on the island because of the fear of Halalii and his followers. Those who knew of the conditions existing on this island could never be induced to come to it for they knew that no living person could live after landing, for the reason that Halalii and those under him would kill and eat them up. As the conditions relating to this island became better known less people came to it, and because of this fact Hanaaumoe was stationed on the coast, and with his cunning words he was to entice travelers ashore and in that way procure the ghosts their favorite food."
"Ma keia pae ana, kau na waa. Komo aku la lakou i loko o ka halau o ke ’kua, a waiho a olulo iho la no ka luhi i ka holo ana mai. Me ko lakou manao no nae i na mea a Hanaaumoe i olelo aku ai.

E!","After the Kauai people made a landing, the canoes were hauled up on the beach and the men all entered a long shed built by the ghosts, and all being tired out on account of the long sea voyage, laid down to rest, fully believing what Hanaaumoe had told them and they all waited for his return . Very late that evening when darkness was upon the land, Hanaaumoe came up to the house and called out:"
"I aku o Kaneopa. (He wahi oopa a.) Aole makou i moe, ke kali aku nei makou [ ] i ka ai i ka ia, i na wahine, pakahi, palua, pakolu a na hoewaa, palima hoi ka ke ’lii o makou ka Kahaookamoku. I mai o Hanaaumoe, ke pii mai nei no, he loihi o Ewa, he pali o Nuuanu, he kula o Kulaokahua, nolaila, he hiki koe.","Kaneopa, a lame fellow, answered: “We are not yet asleep; we are still waiting [ ] for the food, the fish and for the women you promised us; the canoe men for their share of one, two and three, and for the five you promised our chief, Kahaookamoku.” To this Hanaaumoe replied: “They are coming on up; Ewa is a long ways off, Nuuanu is quite a steep climb, and Kulaokahua is a long dry plain, but they will be arriving soon.” After Hanaaumoe had departed, Kaneopa began to entertain a belief that there was something wrong and that there were chances of their being killed, for he was almost sure that Hanaaumoe was deceiving them."
"A hoi o Hanaaumoe, noonoo iho la o Kaneopa, e make ana lakou. He hoopunipuni o Hanaaumoe. A aumoe, a huli ke kau o ka po, hiki hou mai la o Hanaaumoe, a olelo hou e like me mamua.

Kohi iho la ia, a loaa kona lua ma laila, pee iho la ia.","Just after midnight, Hanaaumoe again arrived and called out as at first, and again Kaneopa gave the same answer and the same reply was repeated by Hanaaumoe. With this last call Kaneopa made sure that they would be killed, so he thought of a way to save himself. After spending some time in study he hit upon the plan of concealing himself under the threshold, so he proceeded to dig a hole right under the door and after it was deep enough he got down into it and hid himself."
"A kokoke e kani ka moa mua, ku ana o Hanaaumoe, a kahea mai la penei:","When it was almost time for the crowing of the first cock, Hanaaumoe again came up to the house and called out:"
"Aohe walaau aku, aohe pane leo. Ia wa olelo iho o Hanaaumoe:","There was no reply, not a sound was heard. Hanaaumoe then said to himself:"
"A haha! Lawe ia mai ka moe a Oahu nei, I hea la ka moe, moe aku i Kauai, Lawe ia mai ka ka moe a ka moku akua, Make a o e ola ia Halalii. Pau ka io, pau ka iwi, a o e koe.","So we have you at last. Here you have come to Oahu to do your sleeping. Why didn’t you sleep in Kauai? You have brought yourselves here and are sleeping on the island of the ghosts. You shall all be killed by Halalii; none shall escape. The flesh will be consumed, the bones will be consumed, nothing will be left."
"A pau ka olelo ana a Hanaaumoe, hoi aku la ia, e kii ana ia Halalii a me na akua a pau loa. A hiki o Hanaaumoe, ninau mai la o Halalii, pehea ua moe? Ae mai la o Hanaaumoe.

No ka mea, ua noonoo o Kaneopa, oia kahi a ke ’lii e noho ai, a nolaila, manao iho la ia ma laila e pee ai, i loaa ole i ka poe akua e huli ana.","After making these remarks, Hanaaumoe returned to the king, Halalii, and the rest of the ghosts. When Hanaaumoe arrived, Halalii asked him: “What about the people, are they asleep?” Hanaaumoe answered that they were. With this all the ghosts came to the beach house where Kahaookamoku and his followers were all sound asleep. The ghosts then entered the house while Halalii sat down on the threshold, under which Kaneopa was hiding. Kaneopa had guessed that the king would sit on this very spot which was the reason why he had decided to make his hiding place there and was the means of his escape from the ghosts, later."
"Ia wa, pau loa o Kahaookamoku ma i ka ai ia e ke ’kua. A huli ia o loko o ka hale, a koe ka paepae o ka puka, kahi a Kaneopa e pee ana.","As soon as the ghosts entered the house, they began killing and eating the sleeping men. After eating all that had been killed, a search was made of the house to see that none had been overlooked. Every corner was searched and the house was almost turned up side down, but as the king was sitting on the threshold that place was not searched."
"A ao ae la, hoi aku la ke ’kua i ko lakou wahi, nolaila, nee aku la o Kaneopa a ka [ ] waa, panee aku la a lana i loko o ke kai, holo aku la. A ike o Hanaaumoe, kahea aku la: “E Kaneopa, e pae.” Hoole mai o Kaneopa.","At daylight the next day, the ghosts all returned to the uplands and Kaneopa crawled out of the house to the canoes, pushed one out into the sea, got into it and set [ ] out for Kauai. When Hanaaumoe saw him, he called out: “Say, Kaneopa, come ashore.” Kaneopa refused to do this."
"A hiki o Kaneopa i Kauai, a pae ma Hanalei, e noho ana ke ’lii o Kauai, ke aikane a Kahaookamoku. Hai aku la o Kaneopa i ko lakou poino a pau loa, a lohe ke ’lii, minamina iho la ia no ke aikane. Nolaila, ninau aku la ia i ke kahuna, ia Namalokama: “Pehea la e make ai ke ’kua.” Olelo mai o Namalokama: “Ua make. E olelo oe i na kanaka o Kauai nei a puni, e kalai i kii, a nui, a lau, a mano, a kini, a lehu, a e kalai i na waa, alaila, holo i Oahu, a pela e make ai ke ’kua.”","When Kaneopa arrived at Hanalei, Kauai, he found the king of Kauai at this place, who was the friend of Kahaookamoku, and he proceeded to tell him of how they had gotten into trouble. When the king heard this he expressed much regret at the death of Kahaookamoku, his friend. After a time he turned to his chief priest, Namalokama by name, and asked him: “How are we to go about and accomplish the destruction of these ghosts?” Namalokama replied: “We surely have a way. You give your order to the people of the whole of Kauai, to hew out images, a large number of them, so many that they could not be counted, and also to hew out canoes. After these things are ready, we will set sail for Oahu and we will then be able to kill them all.”"
"A hana iho la pela na kanaka o Kauai, a makaukau loa i na mea a pau loa. Holo mai la lakou.","At the command of the king, the people of Kauai to a man proceeded to carry out the orders and in time the images and canoes were completed and the start for Oahu was made."
"A pae mai la ke ’lii o Kauai i Oahu nei. Kahea ana o Hanaaumoe e like me kana mau hana mua. A komo lakou i ka halau, ahiahi poeleele. I aku ke kahuna o Namalokama i ke ’lii, e kohi ka hale a puni, e waiho i kekahi kii i lalo, a i luna kekahi kii e ahu ai. Ae mai la ke ’lii.","When the king of Kauai was nearing Oahu, Hanaaumoe greeted them as he did on all such occasions and invited them to come and share the hospitality of the island of Oahu. The canoes made for the shore and the people landed; by the time the people got into the shed it became quite dark."
"A pau ia mau mea i ka hana ia, hoi aku la lakou a na waa hiamoe iho la. Ia lakou e moe ana. Kahea ana o Hanaaumoe i ka puka o ka halau, penei:","While the Kauai people were in the shed, Namalokama, the priest, said to the king: “Let us dig up the inside of the house then place the images, some on the ground and some under.” The king assented to this and the people proceeded to dig up the inside of the house and to deposit the images as ordered. After this was done, they all returned to their canoes and waited for the coming of the ghosts. While they were waiting they heard Hanaaumoe calling at the door of the shed, saying:"
"Aohe walaau mai o loko, pane hou aku o Hanaaumoe, o ka lua ia. Aohe no he walaau hou mai, alaila, pane iho o Hanaaumoe, penei:","There being no reply from within, he again called out, and not receiving any response, Hanaaumoe said to himself:"
"Ahaha I hea la ka moe i Kauai, Lawe ia mai ka ka moe a ka moku o Halalii, Make, aohe wahi e ola ai.","So here you are. Why didn’t you sleep at Kauai? Here you have come to sleep on the island of Halalii. You shall all die, nothing will save you."
"Hoi aku la o Hanaaumoe a ka hale, olelo aku la ia Halalii a me na akua a pau loa: “Ua pau i ka hiamoe, e hele kakou e ai.” A lohe o Halalii, hele mai la lakou a pau loa. Komo aku la na akua, a o ke ’lii hoi o Halalii, noho iho la i ka paepae o ka puka.

The ghosts then took up the images and began chewing on them, but found them very hard. One of the ghosts said to the others: “What a tough fellow this is that I have picked up.” Another said: “So is mine, it is awfully hard.”"
"He mea mau i ke ’lii, o ke ka o na kanaka ka ke ’lii e ai, a pela ua poe kii nei. I [ ] ka lawe ana aku i mua o Halalii, olelo mai o Halalii, oolea hoi keia mau kanaka. Ia lakou e ai ana, ala mai la na mea a pau e puhi i ka hale i ke ahi. Hoopuni ae la lakou a puni, a pupuhi ae la i ke ahi. A ma ia puhi ana, pau loa iho la ke ’kua i ka make ia wa hookahi, aohe mea i koe.","It was customary at feasts of this kind for the common ghosts to reserve the choice portions of the different people they killed and present them to their king, and [ ] this was the rule at this feast. When the king was presented with a choice portion, he too made a remark relative to the toughness of the meat, saying: “These fellows are awfully tough and hard.” While the ghosts were busy eating the images, the people from Kauai rose and set the building on fire. They first surrounded the shed and then applied fire to it. In this way all the ghosts were killed, not one escaped."
"Ua kaulana loa ia no kona mama loa i ka hele, a he kukini ia na ke ’lii nui o Maui, na Kakaalaneo. I ka wa e makaukau ai o Kakaalaneo e ai, ka aina kakahiaka.

It was said that when Kakaalaneo was ready for his morning meal he would order Eleio to go to Hana, in East Maui, and bring him some awa. The king at this time lived in Lahaina. As soon as the order was given, Eleio would run off with great speed, all the way from Lahaina to Hana. The distance between these two places is about forty miles. It is said in the legend that Eleio could beat the wind in speed."
"Ma keia holo ana, ua loaa ia ia o Kaahualii, he ’kua ia, i loko o ka nahele o Oopuola. Nonoi mai la ia i ka awa ia Eleio. Olelo aku o Eleio, eia iho no ko huluhulu pili mai, o ka awa ia.","In one of his trips to Hana, he met Kaahualii, a ghost, who lived in the wilderness of Oopuola. When the ghost met him, he asked that he be given some of the awa, but Eleio insulted him by telling him to take the hairs of his body and use it for his awa."
"A lohe o Kaahualii i keia mau olelo inoino a Eleio, hahai mai la me ka mama loa, aole nae he loaa o Eleio no kona mama loa.","When Kaahualii heard this, he gave chase, believing that he could catch Eleio; but he was unable to catch him who ran much faster."
"A hiki mai la ia i mua o Kakaalaneo, e makaukau ana ka ai. Ma keia wa holo o Eleio i ke alanui, ua wali na mana awa i ka mama ia. A komo i ka hale, hoka iho la, a pau ka hoka ana, inu iho la o Kakaalaneo, a pau ai iho la.","When Eleio came to Kakaalaneo, he saw that the meal, the awa for which he was sent, was being served. On his return from Hana Eleio while running was preparing the awa at the same time, so when he entered the house, he placed the awa in the cup, strained it and placed the cup to the mouth of Kakaalaneo. Kakaalaneo was thus enabled to drink his awa before he began on his meal."
"Nolaila, ua kaulana loa o Eleio no kona mama loa a hiki i keia la, a pela no hoi ma kahi i laha kona kaao ana.",Because of this Eleio was noted for his great speed and the people of the present generation think the story to be true.
"Ua kaulana loa ia kanaka ma ka ikaika, a ma ka hana noonoo ole a hiki i keia la. A ua laha kona moolelo ma na wahi a pau loa o keia mau mokupuni. Ma Kona i Hawaii kahi i noho ai o Kanaiahuea, he wahine kana, a he mau makuahunowai.","Kanaiahuea was noted for being a very strong man and also for being a very thoughtless fellow, and his acts were known to the people in all the islands. Kanaiahuea made his home in Kona, Hawaii, was married and lived with his wife’s parents."
"I ke ahiahi, hoomakaukau iho la o Kanaiahuea, i na kiki uala. Oia hoi he mau kihene nunui, ua hana ia a paa. A komo ka waa, ahiahi ae la. Holo aku la o Kanaiahuea maluna o ka waa, oia wale no.

That same evening Kanaiahuea boarded his canoe and set out, all by himself. When the parents of his wife saw the great strength displayed by their son-in-law they were made quite happy."
"Holo aku la a kuia ma kela aoao o ka lae, a hoi no ma keia aoao o ka lae, kuia no. Haihai o mua a me hope o ka waa, aohe ihu, aohe hope.

[ ]","After pushing away in his canoe, he said: “Paddle for Kaupo, Kanaiahuea.” With this he headed for the point of land directly opposite the house and bumped into the rocks. He then turned about and after a time he again bumped into the rocks on that side. In this way the bow as well as the stern of his canoe were smashed. At daylight the next day, when the people woke up they saw that the canoe of Kanaiahuea was floating not very far from the landing, and the people made up their mind that it could not have reached its destination. Therefore Kanaiahuea’s fame has descended to the present time for not knowing how to paddle a canoe. [ ]"
"He Kaikaina o Pupukea no Lonoikamakahiki, ke ’lii nui o Hawaii, a he ’lii nohoi mai na makua mai. A pela nohoi o Pupukea, he ’lii no, no Hawaii. He kino poupou ko Pupukea, he puipui nae, aka, he koa kaulana loa ia. No kona koa ame kona ikaika ma ka hoouka kaua ana, nolaila, ua kaulana loa ia mai Hawaii a Niihau.","Pupukea was the younger brother of Lonoikamakahiki, the renowned king of Hawaii, who was of royal ancestry, consequently Pupukea was indeed a high chief of Hawaii. His body was stout, yet wiry and muscular. Notwithstanding, however, he was a very celebrated warrior. Because of his bravery and strength in battles, therefore he was famous from Hawaii to Niihau."
"No ke koa o Pupukea, haawi aku la o Lonoikamakahiki ia Hawaii a puni i loko o ko Pupukea lima. Iaia ka lilo, ka haawi i na ’lii, ka hana e like me kona makemake, a o Lonoikamakahiki, he noho alii wale iho no kana.","On account of Pupukea’s boldness, Lonoikamakahiki entrusted the whole of Hawaii into Pupukea’s hand. It was his to dispossess or to reinstate the chiefs, and to do with as he pleased; and as to Lonoikamakahiki, his was only to exercise royal authority."
"Ia Lonoikamakahiki i holo mai ai me Pupukea a hiki i Lele ma Maui, oia o Lahaina, e noho ana o Kamalalawalu, ke ’lii nui o Maui ma Keawaiki ma Lele me kona kaikaina o Makakuikalani.","When Lonoikamakahiki and Pupukea sailed and arrived at Lele, which is Lahaina, on Maui, Kamalalawalu, the great king of Maui, was living at Keawaiki, in Lele, with his younger brother Makakuikalani."
"He kaikaina o Makakuikalani no Kamalalawalu, ke ’lii nui o Maui, a he ’lii nohoi o Makakuikalani no Maui a puni. He kanaka koa loa o Makakuikalani, a he koa kaulana loa no Maui a puni. A no kona koa ame kona ikaika, haawi aku la o Kamalalawalu ia Maui a puni i loko o kona lima. Iaia ka lilo ame ka haawi e like me kona makemake; a o ka Kamalalawalu, o ka noho alii wale no maluna o Maui.","Makakuikalani was the younger brother of Kamalalawalu, the famous king of Maui, and Makakuikalani was, moreover, a chief throughout Maui. He was a very courageous soldier and a most distinguished warrior of all Maui. Owing to his dauntless spirit and his strength, Kamalalawalu assigned all of Maui to his control. It was his to disfavor and to award according to his desire; and concerning Kamalalawalu, he simply held kingly sway over Maui."
"Moe iho la lakou a ao ia po, olelo aku o Kamalalawalu ia Lonoikamahiki: “E au kakou i ka heenalu.” Ae mai la o Lonoikamakahiki. Au aku la lakou a ma waho o Keawaiki, heenalu iho la, a kupono ka la i ka lolo (oia ka ainaawakea), hoi aku la lakou i uka, auau ka wai a pau, kaulai ka malo pulu, hoi aku la a ka hale, noho iho la. [ ]","They slept until the night was passed, when Kamalalawalu said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Let us swim out for surf-riding.” Lonoikamakahiki consented. They swam out and, reaching outside of Keawaiki, they commenced to surf; and when the sun was directly overhead (which is the middle of the day) they returned to land, bathed in [fresh] water, then spread out the wet loin cloth to dry, and repaired to the house, and there remained. [ ]"
"Ma keia noho ana, ua makaukau ka Kamalalawalu mau aipuupuu i ka ai, i ka i’a, i ka awa, ame ke po’i wai holoi. Nolaila, ninau aku o Lonoikamakahiki ia Pupukea: “Auhea ka kaua ai a me ka i’a; a auhea ko kaua awa?” I aku o Pupukea : “ Ei ae no. He moa ka ia, aohe nae i moa. A o ka awa nohoi, aole i mama ia a wali.”","During this retirement, Kamalalawalu’s stewards prepared food, meat, awa, and a water basin. Wherefore, Lonoikamakahiki asked Pupukea: “Where is our food and fish; and where is our awa?” Pupukea answered: “They are near by. The meat is chicken, but it is not yet cooked. And as to the awa, it has not been masticated.”"
"Nolaila, huhu o Lonoikamakahiki ia Pupukea, lele aku la papai i ka papalina o Pupukea. Lalau iho la o Pupukea i ka awa a mama iho la. Lele hou aku o Lonoikamakahiki papai i ka papalina o Pupukea. Olelo mai o Pupukea ia Lonoikamakahiki: “Ka! o ka papai ka mamua? Kai no o ka olelo mai, a lohe na puka haiki o ka pepeiao, alaila, pono hoi ke pai ana.”","Whereat, Lonoikamakahiki, infuriated by Pupukea, sprang forward and slapped his cheek. Pupukea then took the awa and chewed it. Again Lonoikamakahiki sprang forward and struck Pupukea’s cheek. Pupukea said to Lonoikamakahiki: “What! is the striking first? Why not first speak, and when the narrow openings of the ear hear the charge, then it will be just to slap?”"
KA HIKIWAWAE LOA O PUPUKEA MA KA LAWELAWE ANA I KA MEA AI A LONOIKAMAKAHIKI.,PUPUKEA’S PROMPTNESS IN THE PREPARATION OF LONOIKAMAKAHIKI’S FOOD.
"Ia Pupukea e mama ana i ka awa i kona waha, lalau aku la kekahi lima ona i ka moa. (Oia moa, na Lonoikamakahiki no, no Oahu aku nei no.) A uhae ae la i ka uha, a kopi iho la i ka paakai, a kau aku la i luna o ke ahi nanahu, pela nohoi kekahi uha o ka moa a me ke kino a pau loa.

A pau ka inu ana, ai iho la i ka moa, a pau ka ai ana, ona aku la o Lonoikamakahiki a moe iho la.","While Pupukea was chewing the awa in his mouth, he reached forth one of his hands and seized the chicken (one that belonged to Lonoikamakahiki from Oahu here). He tore the leg apart, salted it, and placed it over a charcoal fire, as also the other leg of the chicken and the entire body. Pupukea baked the chicken with the feathers which had not been pulled off, but, when turned over the feathers were consumed by the fire. With the mastication of four mouthfuls of awa, the chicken was cooked. Pupukea squeezed out the awa juice into the awa cup and placed it before Lonoikamakahiki who drank it. Having finished drinking, he ate the chicken; and having completed the meal, Lonoikamakahiki was intoxicated and slept."
"Ma keia mau hana eleu a Pupukea, ua komo ka makemake a me ka iini i ko Kamalalawalu naau. No ka eleu ame ka hikiwawe loa o Pupukea ma ka hana ana i ka mea ai, no ka wa pokole loa o ka ai ana. Nolaila, nonoi aku o Kamalalawalu i ke ’lii o Hawaii penei: “E Kalani! e ke ’lii o Hawaii, e aho na’u ka kaua aipuupuu, akahi kuu makemake i ka eleu ame ka hikiwawe.” I aku o Lonoikamakahiki: “Aole e loaa ia oe, o ko’u hooilina aina no ia o Hawaii. Iaia ka lilo, ke koe, ka haawi i na ’lii ame ke kanaka, ka aua, ke kaua ame ke kaua ole, o ka noho alii wale iho no ka’u no Hawaii, o ka mea ia nona ka aina.”","At these wonderful performances of Pupukea, an appreciation and strong desire entered Kamalalawalu’s mind, because of the skill and promptness of Pupukea in the preparation of the food, and because of the very short time required by the meal; therefore, Kamalalawalu entreated of the king of Hawaii as follows: “O Kalani! King of Hawaii, it is better that I have our steward, for I highly value his efficiency and promptness.” Lonoikamakahiki replied: “You can not be favored, inasmuch as he is my property-holder of Hawaii. It is his to dispossess, to retain, and to favor the chiefs and the men; to withhold; to fight or not to fight. My part is simply to reign on Hawaii. He is the one that governs the land.”"
"Mahope iho o ka Lonoikamakahiki olelo ana ia Kamalalawalu, olelo mai o Makakuikalani no Pupukea, penei: “Haahaa, haka pau i ka iole.” I aku o Pupukea ia Makakuikalani, penei: [ ]","Following Lonoikamakahiki’s answer to Kamalalawalu, Makakuikalani remarked regarding Pupukea, as follows: “A low shelf is reached by the rat.” Pupukea answered Makakuikalani, saying: [ ]"
"O ka iki makua ia o ka ulu, Nana e kaa ke kahua e pau ai; He paa kokea no Kohala, E kole ai ko waha ke ai.","The short mature [one] is the sphere Who shall sweep the plain entirely; The resistant white sugar-cane of Kohala, That injures your mouth when eaten."

I mai o Pupukea i kana olelo kaena, penei:","After these words, Lonoikamakahiki inquired of Kamalalawalu: “Where is your land administrator?” Kamalalawalu responded: “There he is, Makakuikalani, the tall man standing yonder.” And when Kamalalawalu had finished speaking to Lonoikamakahiki, relative to his young brother, Makakuikalani, Pupukea answered his taunting words, as follows:"
"Lanalana, paia e ke kona, huli pu; He pumaia, loaa i ke kikio, hina.","A spider, struck by the kona wind, overturns; A banana bunch, attacked by a wind gust, falls."
"Ma keia olelo a Pupukea, pane mai o Makakuikalani i kana olelo kaena, penei:","By this speech of Pupukea’s, Makakuikalani retorted with his boasting words, as follows:"

Ilaila i hooko ia ai na olelo a Makakuikalani me Pupukea.","In this dialogue of theirs, one was claiming that he was the more powerful; as also the other. Furthermore, in this banter between them, the words were planted in their minds until the period wherein Kamalalawalu fought against Lonoikamakahiki at Waimea, on Hawaii. There the words of Makakuikalani and Pupukea were carried into effect."
"Ma keia wahi, e waiho i ka olelo no lakou, a e kamailio no Kauhiakama, ke keiki a Kamalalawalu, ka mea i hoouna ia i Hawaii e kiu ai.","At this point, let us discontinue their narrative and touch upon Kauhiakama, Kamalalawalu’s son, the one that was dispatched to Hawaii to spy."
"A hala aku o Lonoikamakahiki me Pupukea i Hawaii, noho iho la o Kamalalawalu me kana keiki o Kauhiakama, a liuliu.

Said Kamalalawalu to Kauhiakama: “You sail to Hawaii and make observations of the land, of the people, and the government thereof.” Upon finishing speaking, Kauhiakama set sail with his canoes and disembarked at Kawaihae."
"Mamua ae o ka pae ana, hele aku la o Kauhiakama a hiki i Puako, a Kapalaoa, Kaniku, Kiholo, Mahaiula, Kailua, Holualoa, Kahaluu, Keauhou, Kaawaloa.

At Kaawaloa, the route of travel was lost, because the slanting cliff and the crags barred them in the front. Wherefore, Kauhiakama had retraced his course and arrived at Kawaihae."
"Ma keia hele ana a Kauhiakama, ua mama loa, a no kona mama, ua hele no ia [ ] hookahi la, a hoi no ia la hookahi me ka po ole.

Tarrying two days at Kawaihae, they departed for Maui, and landed at Keawaiki, which was Lele, and which, at present, is Lahaina. There were Kamalalawalu and Makakuikalani."
"Mahope o ka pae ana o Kauhiakama i Lele, ninau aku o Kamalalawalu: “Pehea o Hawaii?” I aku o Kauhiakama, i kana olelo hooio, a hoole.","After Kauhiakama had disembarked at Lele, Kamalalawalu questioned him: “How is Hawaii?” Kauhiakama gave his reply, boasting and misleading:"
"Lei Kohala; eia i ka nuku na kanaka. Aohe kanaka o Hawaii a puni, Ua hele au mai Kawaihae, A hiki i Kaawaloa ma Kona, Aohe kanaka, o ke ku hale wale no.","Beautiful Kohala! The people’s height is to the nose. There are no men on the whole of Hawaii. I have voyaged from Kawaihae, To Kaawaloa, in Kona. There are no men; the houses stand empty."
"Ma keia mau olelo a Kauhiakama, ua puni o Kamalalawalu, a nolaila, hoomakaukau iho la ia e holo e kaua me Lonoikamakahiki.","On account of these words of Kauhiakama, Kamalalawalu was deceived; and therefore, he made preparations to sail away and fight with Lonoikamakahiki."
"E kamailio iki no Kauhiakama. He keu o Kauhiakama a ke kanaka manao ole ma ka nana i kana mau hana, a he kanaka hupo loa. Me he mea ala no hai kona opu ame ke poo i noonoo ole iho ai.

He was an exceedingly careless man regarding his proceedings, and was very ignorant. It seemed as if his stomach and head belonged to others that he could not be more thoughtless. While he had been cruising from Kawaihae to Kaawaloa, the seashore borders were completely covered with standing houses. Since he had approached in the early morning, the dwellers had ascended to the uplands to till the soil, while others had gone fishing, therefore, they were not found in the houses. It was at Kohala, the place he had seen that there were many men and numerous houses, and which was the only place, he thought, that was populated."

Ua olelo ia, ua paa ke kai o Alenuihaha, mai Maui aku a Kohala a Kawaihae, aole ike ia ka ale ame ke kai.","On this journey of Kamalalawalu’s with his Maui men to Hawaii to fight, there were very many canoes. (It is said that the Alenuihaha channel was so covered from Maui to Kohala and Kawaihae that the waves and the sea were invisible.)"
"A pae lakou i Kawaihae, papani ia na kahakai e na waa mai ka lae o Kanamee, ma Upolu, i Kohala, a hiki ma Kaelehuluhulu i Kona. Kona loihi, ua like ia me na mile he kanakolu.

Kii aku o Kamalalawalu e pepehi.","When they landed at Kawaihae, the seashores were blockaded by the canoes from the promontory of Kanamee, Upolu, to Kohala, and thence to Kaelehuluhulu, in Kona, and whose extent approximated thirty miles. The chief of Waimea and Kawaihae at that time was Kanaloauo. He gave battle to Kamalalawalu, and Kanaloauo was defeated by him. Kamalalawalu then went forth to slay him."
"Ia wa, e noho ana malaila elua kanaka, o Kumaikeau, o Kumakaia. He mau kanaka laua ua pili ia Lonoikamakahiki ame Kanaloauo. Olelo pahele aku laua ia Kamalalawalu, [ ] penei. “Ua make. Aole make pepehi, e kakau ka papalina i ka uhi.” No keia olelo, kakau ia iho la o Kanaloauo i ka uhi, a paele, kuu ia aku la.","At that time, two men, Kumaikeau and Kumakaia, were abiding there. They were men related to Lonoikamakahiki and Kanaloauo. Both cunningly addressed Kamalalawalu, saying: “He is conquered; it is not wise to kill, but let a veil conceal his [ ] face.” At this behest, Kanaloauo was covered with the veil until completely hidden, whereupon he was released."
"He keu keia o na kanaka maalea loa i loko oia kau, a he keu nohoi laua o ka noonoo i mea e make ai o Kamalalawalu ame na koa o Maui a puni. Ma keia pio ana o Kanaloauo ia Kamalalawalu, hele aku la o Kumaikeau ame Kumakaia a ke alo o Kamalalawalu, uwe aku la, penei:","These were unsurpassed and very crafty men of that period, and both were active in devising a plan that would lead to the defeat of Kamalalawalu and the entire Maui forces. At this capture of Kanaloauo by Kamalalawalu, Kumaikeau and Kumakaia went into the presence of Kamalalawalu and lamented as follows:"
"Auwe! Akahi no a pili ka maka. Akahi no a ono ka ai, Ua pio ke kolohe, A oe koe ka ai, ka i’a, Ka puaa, ke kapa, ka pa-u, Ka aina, ka hale e noho ai, He mea noho ia iho no ka ka hale la!

Aole e ola ia oe, ua make!","O! At last the eyes may close. Just now the food is desired, For the oppressor is captured. The food, the fish, remained not, Nor pig, nor raiment, nor skirt, Nor land, nor house wherein to dwell. Lo! The house is discovered to be fit to live in. By your coming, O Kamalalawalu, Sleep we in the house with the wife; Welcome is the food and the fish. The kapas are worn with warmth. You indeed are the one to deliver us; You indeed shall secrete these bones. O Kalani! We are defeated! We cannot be saved by you; we are defeated!"
"A pau ka laua uwe ana, olelo aku la laua ia Kamalalawalu:","When they had finished their lament, both said to Kamalalawalu:"
"E Kalani!

Destroy all the canoes, Sever the cord and the canoe rope, Chop the cross-piece and the out-rigger; Cut the canoe’s stern and bow till shortened; Lest when we give battle And shall defeat Lonoikamakahiki and men They will flee hither to the sea, Beholding the canoes afloat, will board them; Will flee to the ocean And land on Kahoolawe and Maui, Where the vanquished will be safe!"
"Ma keia mau olelo a Kumaikeau a me Kumakaia, he mea oluolu loa ia i ko Kamalalawalu manao. (E kuhi ana ia he oiaio, aole ka uanei.) I hou aku ua mau kanaka [ ] nei ia Kamalalawalu: “Ua make ia oe o Lonoikamakahiki. Aia kona wahi e make ai ia oe, o kela puu i uka o Waimea, o Hokuula ka inoa. I luna oe o laila me kou mau koa, hookahi au hana he olokaa i ka pohaku maluna iho.”","Because of these words of Kumaikeau and Kumakaia, the proposition was [ ] warmly welcomed by Kamalalawalu’s mind. (He thought it was the truth, but it was not so.) The men again said to Kamalalawalu: “Lonoikamakahiki is your sure prey. There is the place he may be killed by you; that hill upland of Waimea, Hokuula by name. Once you stand thereon with your warriors, your duty will be simply to roll the rocks from above.”"
"Aia no ia puu ma Waimea a hiki i keia la, ma ka hema o Kohala Akau. He puu kaulana loa ia, no ka hoouka kaua ana a Kamalalawalu maluna o laila, me kona koa kaulana o Makakuikalani.

It is a very famous eminence because of the battle fought by Kamalalawalu and his distinguished warrior Makakuikalani thereon. On that hill, there are no stones, nor trees, but grass and soil are thereon. Notwithstanding, however, according to the statement by Kumaikeau and Kumakaia, there were stones on the top."
"Ma ko laua olelo ana ia Kamalalawalu, oia kona puuhonua e ola ai, nana ka make. Aole e hiki i ka pohaku, ame ka ihe o lalo ke pii ae i luna, ame ke kanaka, nokamea, he puu kiekie loa, he hapalua mile paha kona kiekie mai ka ili o lalo a ka piko o luna loa.","In their report to Kamalalawalu , it was a refuge where he might be unmolested, and that his was the conquest. The stones, the javelins, and the men from below could not reach thereon; because, it was a very high bluff, about a half of a mile in height from the ground below to the very summit."
"A hiki o Kamalalawalu i luna o laila, i nana iho ka hana, aohe pohaku, aohe laau, he lepo wale no.

While they were engaged in a conversation with Kumaikeau together with Kumakaia, at that time the messengers were sent to summon Lonoikamakahiki and Pupukea. At Kealakekua, in Kona, was the place where Lonoikamakahiki lived. When the messenger appeared before him, he said to Lonoikamakahiki: “Kamalalawalu and Makakuikalani have come to give battle to you both; and have contended with Kanaloauo, who is a captive of Kamalalawalu.”"
"A lohe o Lonoikamakahiki, ninau mai la ia i ka elele: “Aia i hea e kaua ai?” I aku ka elele: “Aia i Waimea, i luna o kela puu o Hokuula, aia malaila o Kamalalawalu e noho la, me Maui a puni.” Ma keia lohe ana o Lonoikamakahiki, ia wa na luna i hele ai e houluulu i na kanaka o Kona a pau loa.

Ma keia hele ana, ua nui loa na kanaka, ua piha na alanui, ku ka ea o ka lepo i ka wawae o na kanaka.","When Lonoikamakahiki heard these things, he questioned the messenger: “Where is the battle to take place?” The messenger replied: “There, at Waimea, on top of that hill, Hokuula, where Kamalalawalu and all Maui are stationed.” Upon Lonoikamakahiki hearing this, instantly the overseers went forth to muster all the men of Kona. It is said that there were 32,000 men of Kona at that time. From thence the messenger traveled till he arrived at Kapapala, in Kau, where Pupukea was residing. When he heard [the tidings], he gathered together Kau, and marched forth between Maunakea and Hualalai. The herald journeyed on and touched at Puna, at Hilo, and Hamakua, to gather the people together at Kohala, and hearing, they came. At this sallying forth, there were very many men, the paths being overcrowded and the dust rising on account of the tread of the soldiers."
"Alanui Akahi. Ma Kaniku mai. (Oia ko Kona.) Elua lau mano kanaka. (Ua like me 32,000 tausani kanaka.) [ ]","First route: From Kaniku. (Kona’s.) Two lau mano men. (Equivalent to 32,000 men.) [ ]"

"Alanui Akolu. Ma Mahiki. He umi lau mano kanaka ka nui. Ekolu Moku, o Puna, o Hilo, o Hamakua.","Third route: From Mahiki, aggregated 160,000 men. There were three districts: Puna, Hilo and Hamakua."

Ina he aui la kau manawa i hele ai, loaa ia oe na kanaka i ka hale.”","While Kamalalawalu was on the hill of Hokuula, in Waimea, he beheld the dust rising above the stones of Kaniku, the stones being gradually reddened by the dirt. On account of the many men the darkness of the stones was covered by the dust. And when Kamalalawalu saw the men of Kaniku advancing, he inquired of Kauhiakama: “Where have you traveled on Hawaii that you failed to observe the people?” Kauhiakama answered: “From Kawaihae to Kaawaloa, in Kona, were the places I visited, but I encountered no person.” Kamalalawalu said to Kauhiakama: “Did you not see houses standing?” “There were houses indeed, but there were no occupants. There were pigs running about, and there were chickens crowing.” Whereupon, Kumaikeau and Kumakaia remarked: “You could not find the occupants at home, for they had gone upland to till the ground because it was morning, and they had gone out fishing. If it were in the afternoon you went there, you would have met the men at home.”"
"Ma keia lohe ana o Kamalalawalu, olelo mai la ia Kauhiakama: “Make kaua, aole e ola. E kuhi ana au i kau olelo he oiaio, aole ka! I ike no la oe ia wai, he mea ku wale ka hale aohe kanaka. Kai no o ka hale ku o ke kanaka noho. Aloha kaua i ka make mamuli o kau olelo, ehia ka mea aloha o ka wahine me na keiki, i ka ike ole mai i keia puu make, a i ka ike ole aku ia lakou.”","Kamalalawalu, on hearing this, said to Kauhiakama: “We shall perish; we can not be saved. I thought your report was true, but it is not so. By whom have you been taught that the house is a thing that stands without dwellers. Why! The house is erected, the men live therein. Woe betide us that we perish by your report. Alas! How great is the love of the wife and the children who will fail to see this corpse, or that [I] see them not.”"
"Ia Kamalalawalu e kamailio ana, hiki mai la o Lonoikamakahiki me Kona a pau loa. Makai o Puako a uka o Waimea ka paa i na kanaka, aole i ike ia ka lepo, ka pohaku, a me ka laau, no ka paa i na kanaka.

Ina i make o Pupukea ia Makakuikalani, alaila, pio o Hawaii; a ina hoi o Makakuikalani ke make ia Pupukea, alaila, pio o Maui. Ua hooholo ia keia mau olelo a laua e Makakuikalani ame Pupukea.","While Kamalalawalu was speaking, Lonoikamakahiki and all of Kona arrived. From the south of Puako to above Waimea, the men were so compact that the dirt, stones, the trees could not be detected because they were obscured by the men. Simultaneously, Pupukea appeared with the Kau, Mahiki, and Kohala contingents, and so completely blocked up Waimea as to allow no space. When Kamalalawalu met with Lonoikamakahiki, they resolved that Makakuikalani and Pupukea stand first to fight. Should Pupukea be vanquished by Makakuikalani, then Hawaii was conquered; but should Makakuikalani be defeated by Pupukea, then Maui was subdued. These words of theirs were agreed to by Makakuikalani and Pupukea."
"Ia wa ku o Makakuikalani me Pupukea me ka laua mau laau palau. Ia laua e ku ana, pane mai ke kumu a Pupukea, penei: “E Kalani! Haahaa ka laau.” I mai o [ ] Pupukea: “Io i ka hale, pau ke a’o ana a ke kumu.” Mahope o laila, hahau o Pupukea i kana laau palau, pa i ke kumu, waiho i lalo. A liuliu, ala mai la ke kumu a olelo mai ia Pupukea: “Pakele oe! E make au, make oe. Aole, ola ae nei au, ola oe. Nolaila e hue lepo ka laau.”","Immediately Makakuikalani and Pupukea went forward with their long spears. While they were standing, Pupukea’s instructor called out: “O Kalani! [ ] Strike low the stick.” Pupukea replied: “Whilst in the house, the tutor’s instruction is finished.” Thereafter, Pupukea struck with his long spear, falling on and knocking the teacher down. After a while, the instructor arose and said to Pupukea: “You are safe! Had I been killed, you would have perished. It is not so; I have been spared so you are saved. Wherefore, let the stick stir the dust.”"
"Ia Pupukea e olelo ana me ke kumu, hahau o Makakuikalani i kana laau palau i luna o ka ai o Pupukea (oia ka aa) a haule iho la o Pupukea i lalo o ka honua, a waiho iho la.

Lalau iho la ia i ke po’i a papale i ke poo.","While Pupukea was conversing with the tutor, Makakuikalani delivered a blow with his long spear on the neck (which is the vital spot), and Pupukea fell down on the ground and remained inert. Said one to Makakuikalani: “Your opponent is not dead. Strike once more.” Makakuikalani answered: “He is dead, for it is a blow of the powerful.” Makakuikalani implored of Kamalalawalu: “My ration of food, you give me for my breast is pierced.” Makakuikalani ate until satisfied, and the taro food in the calabash was exhausted. Then he reached for the container and covered it on his head."
"E pono e olelo maanei no Makakuikalani. O keia po’i a Makakuikalani i papale ai i kona poo, he po’i ipu laau. E ia kana olelo kaena: “He po’i laau ka’u e papale nei, he laau palau auanei kana na laua ia e kike laau.”","It is proper to speak here about Makakuikalani. Concerning this container Makakuikalani had donned on his head, it was a wooden calabash, and here is his boastful remark: “I am wearing a wooden receptacle; a long spear may be his; but let the two clash together as wood.”"
"A hiki o Makakuikalani i mua o Pupukea, ala ae la o Pupukea i luna. Ia laua e ku ana, lalau iho la o Pupukea i kana laau palau a hahau hualepo ae la ia Makakuikalani. Ma keia hahau ana, waiho o Makakuikalani i lalo . I aku ke kumu ia Pupukea: “E hoomoe hou ko laau palau i luna o ka hoapaio i make.” I aku o Pupukea: “Ua make, he laau na ka ui. Ke hele nei a kukai ka ila o Pupukea.”","When Makakuikalani appeared before Pupukea, Pupukea arose. While both were standing, Pupukea grabbed his long spear and vehemently struck at Makakuikalani. At the delivery of this blow, Makakuikalani sank down. Said the instructor to Pupukea: “Lay again your spear on the antagonist so as to kill.” Answered Pupukea: “He is dead, for it was a blow of the stalwart. The dark spot of Pupukea is confirmed.”"
"A make o Makakuikalani ia Pupukea, ia wa, luku o Hawaii ia Maui. Nolaila, hee mai la o Maui a ke awa, aohe waa e hoi ai i Maui. Nolaila kau aku la lakou maluna o Kepoiamalau a pau iho la i ke piho, a make iho la. Nolaila, luku iho la lakou a pau loa na kane o Maui i ka make.","Upon the death of Makakuikalani by Pupukea, instantly, Hawaii slaughtered Maui, whereupon, the Mauiites retreated towards the landing, but there were no canoes wherein to return to Maui. Therefore they boarded on Kepoiamalau and were all swamped and captured. In that predicament, they were slaughtered until all the Maui men were killed."
"Ma keia kaua ana, ua make o Kamalalawalu ame Makakuikalani ia Lonoikamakahiki ame Pupukea, a ua lanakila o Hawaii ma keia kaua ana. [ ]","In this battle, Kamalalawalu and Makakuikalani were slain by Lonoikamakahiki and Pupukea, and Hawaii was victorious in this strife. [ ]"

He excelled in courage and in skill. He could contend against the government and a countless number of men. Here is Kekuhaupio’s bravery as herein narrated: The spears were as bath water for Kekuhaupio, for he could dodge the spears, whether four hundred, or four thousand. Furthermore, he could escape being hit by the javelins, spear points, long spears, or stones within the same interval, for which fact, Kekuhaupio was much feared by every one of the chiefs and celebrated warriors of that period. His prowess even continued unto the days of Kalaiopuu and his reign. Likewise during Kamehameha’s rule."

Oulu is very widely known even to this day on all the islands of this Hawaii, because of his great skill in throwing the sling-stone. The stone of Oulu never missed man, pig, dog, chicken, or any bird. If Oulu should cast his sling-stone, the fire would ignite, and the soil would be furrowed when the ala fell. Oulu could contend with a collective body (that is, a very great number of men, and corresponds to six lau men and more). He could fight against a whole army. Since Oulu was very skillful in casting the sling-stone, therefore, he was much dreaded by the whole of Maui and all the district chiefs. For that reason, Oulu was highly esteemed by Kahekili up to the time of his death."

In this journey, Kekuhaupio had also accompanied Kalaiopuu to Maui. The place where the battle occurred was at Waikapu, in Maui. In this struggle, Kekuhaupio was not in the first engagement, because he was at Kalepolepo at that time. Only Kalaiopuu and the entire forces of Hawaii entered [ ] into the conflict. In this battle, all the Hawaii forces and the king, Kalaiopuu, were defeated."
"Ma keia hee ana, holo o Kalaiopuu ame na kanaka a pau loa i ke kula o Kamaomao, mawaena o Wailuku ame Kalepolepo. Ma keia holo ana, ua pau ko lakou aho i ke alualu ia e ko Maui poe koa.

On retreating, they were breathless because the Maui army gave chase. Their feet were becoming limp and not fleet in running; they were utterly exhausted."
"Ia lakou e holo ana, pii aku la o Kekuhaupio mai Kalepolepo aku, a hiki i ke kula o Kamaomao. Iaia i hiki ai ma ia kula halawai mai la o Kalaiopuu me ia.

On approaching the plain, Kalaiopuu met him, whereupon Kekuhaupio asked him: “What is this?” Kalaiopuu answered: “We are defeated.” Kekuhaupio said: “Stand there to rest while I combat.”"
"Maanei e ike ai kakou i ke koa lua ole o Kekuhaupio ame kona make ole i ka lehulehu. A pau ka olelo a Kekuhaupio ia Kalaiopuu, ku iho la o Kekuhaupio mawaena o Hawaii ame ko Maui poe.

When Kekuhaupio had finished speaking to Kalaiopuu, he planted himself between the Hawaii and the Maui forces. Whereupon the Mauiites fought against Kekuhaupio single-handed, but they were not victorious."
"Ma keia kaua ana, o o ka ihe a Maui ia Kekuhaupio, ka pololu, ka elau, ke kuia, ka laau palau, ame na mea eha a pau loa.

Nevertheless, those things were merely bathing water, for he was neither struck, nor hit by the stone. In this combat of Kekuhaupio with Maui, the javelin, spear point, lance, and stones were stacked up high on his side, and the Mauiites were without weapons."
"No keia nele o lakou i ka mea kaua ole, holo aku la lakou a ke alo o Kahekili, olelo aku la: “Kupanaha keia kanaka no Hawaii, he wai auau nona ka ihe ame na mea eha a pau loa. Aohe kanaka, he ’kua.

The javelin and all weapons are as mere bathing water to him. He is not a man, but a god. Kalaiopuu and all Hawaii were defeated by us, and we gave chase until reaching the plain of Kamaomao. When we looked, behold! this brave warrior was standing. That man was the one that contended against us; he wavered not, nor did he dodge. He stood there perfectly calm and confronted us with coolness; still he could not be struck by us.”"

Nolaila, he ’kua ka maa ame ka ala i kona manao.) Ia manawa, lalau o Oulu i ka maa ame na ala a hele e halawai me Kekuhaupio.","Here we shall notice the courage of Oulu and Kekuhaupio. When Kahekili heard all the men of Maui’s report relative to Kekuhaupio because of his superior bravery and skill, he then inquired of Oulu: “How is that?” Oulu answered: “He is your god’s.” (Here is the meaning of Oulu’s remark: His sling and missile never missed, when cast at a man, pig, bird or dog. For which fact, the sling and the stone were deified in his estimation.) Whereupon, Oulu took up his sling and missiles and went forth to meet Kekuhaupio."
"Ia laua e ku ana, he mau anana eono ke kowa mawaena o laua a elua, lalau iho la o Oulu i ka ala a hookomo iho la i loko o ka maa.

On casting the first shot, the wind blew furiously, fire ignited, and the dirt where it fell was deeply furrowed. It sped with tremendous force and fell under the feet of Kekuhaupio. The reason for [ ] this escape of Kekuhaupio was his skill in evading. As he raised his foot, that was the time the place where he had been standing became a deep furrow, and the spot was permeated with heat, as if it were a fire. Oulu’s first stone having missed Kekuhaupio, Oulu reached for another, and placed it in the sling, that being the second. He then shot at Kekuhaupio. At this missile of Oulu’s, fear and dread entered Kekuhaupio. Wherefore, Kekuhaupio offered that pebble to the god, Lono. This is the manner in which he petitioned the god, Lono:"
"E Lono e! E Lono e! Nau ka ala a Oulu, E lawe oe i ka pololei, I ka ikaika, i ka maa, E uli ma o, ma o, e hala, E nana i ke kahuna, I ke koa nui o ka hikina, E ola au! E ola au! Lele wale! Amama! Ua noa.","O Lono eh! O Lono eh! Yours is Oulu’s stone, Take you the unerring aim, The force of the sling stone. Turn it hither, thither; let it miss. Have compassion on the priest, On the great warrior of the east. Let me live! Let me live! The prayer is heard! Amen! ’Tis released!"
"Ia Kekuhaupio e kaumaha ana i ke ’kua ona ia Lono, lele mai la ka ala a Oulu, alo ae la o Kekuhaupio, hala. Alua ala a Oulu i hala. Alaila, lalau hou o Oulu i ka ala a hookomo i ka maa.

[ ]","Whilst Kekuhaupio was entreating his god Lono, Oulu’s stone came flying; Kekuhaupio dodged and it went astray. Two of Oulu’s stones had wandered off. Then, Oulu took another stone and placed it in the sling. Whereupon, Kekuhaupio besought Oulu, saying: “That is my stone.” Oulu consented. It was his third and last stone. In this contest of theirs, Kekuhaupio was victorious over Oulu; and on account of the defeat of Oulu on that occasion, Hawaii was successful that day. [ ]"

He was the son of Kahekilinui, the king of Maui, in consequence of which, Peapea was really a high chief. Peapea could seize and crush two, three, and even a greater number of men. They were trifles to him. While Kahahana, a king of the whole of Oahu here, was ruling, he ceded this island to Kahekili, the king of Maui, but afterwards rebelled and ignored that cession. Because of this renunciation by Kahahana, the report of which reached Kahekili, therefore, Kahekili sailed here with his war fleet and landed at Waikiki. He dispatched a messenger to summon Kahahana to come before him to consult relative to the truth or falsity of the rumor."
"A o kahi a Kahahana e noho ana, o Kaneohe, i Koolaupoko.

When the messenger appeared before him, he delivered Kahekili’s order. Kahahana on hearing this message questioned his priests: “How are these words of the king?” The priests answered: “O king! It is not wise that you comply and restore the land to him, because you are well prepared at this time; you have nothing lacking. Therefore, let there be strife and by the point of the spear and javelin will be decided your victory or your dispossession.”"
"A lohe o Kahahana i keia mau olelo a kana mau kahuna, paa iho la kona manao e kaua a e hoole i na olelo a Kahekili.

Two days had elapsed following the return of the courier that had been sent by Kahekili to Kahahana, when the report was made that war was the only alternative; then, battle preparations were made. These arrangements were made at Waikiki-kai. When the curtains of dawn parted, the ranks commenced to march up to Nuuanu. Whilst they were ascending, the rumor reached Peapea in the upland of Manoa, where he was residing, in the woman’s house. These were the words reported to him: “Say, Peapea! There is a struggle on the lowlands. When I left, the van was just beginning to move towards Kulaokahua.” Peapea inquired, “Whose is the battle?” The herald replied, “The battle is for Kahahana.”"
"A lohe o Peapea, haalele iho la ia i ka wahine a holo mai la ma uka mai o Ualakaa, a Makiki, Pauoa, Kaheiki, e pili la me Maemae. Ilaila loaa iaia ka maka mua o [ ] na kanaka o Kahekili.

There he met the van of the army of Kahekili. As to the forces of Kahahana, the main army was at Waolani; while the front was descending from Maemae. When Peapea arrived between Kahekili’s and Kahahana’s warriors, he stood to defy [the advance]."
"Ia Peapea e ku ana mawaena o ko Maui aoao ame ko Oahu aoao, hoomaka aku la ia e kaua.

He pursued the numerous warriors of Kahahana, and when they were caught by him, they were crushed (breaking in his hands as a brittle twig by the destroyer, was his treatment of the men). Likewise were those on the right hand and on the left. Thus he pressed upward until he encountered the poe , and they were standing in a circle. (The meaning of the word “poe”: a very great number of men, ranging from two laus to a mano , equivalent to eight hundred or more.)"
"A hiki o Peapea i kahi o ka poe kaua o Kahahana, komo aku la o Peapea i loko o na kanaka, o kona manawa ia i puni ai i ka lehulehu.

Simultaneously, the javelins were cast, the long spear, the spike, the war club; the stone was hurled, the maa thrower cast his sling-shot, the club was struck; but they were as bathing water for Peapea, and they were as nothing to his powerful strength. Thus he went slaughtering until reaching Luakaha, in Nuuanu. Kahahana and his chiefs were defeated and fled, the majority having been all slain by Peapea. Oahu being conquered by Kahekili, Peapea took Kekuapoi, Kahahana’s wife, as his own, on account of his courage and strength, and [they] lived together."
"Ua kaulana loa o Kekuapoi i ka wahine maikai loa a me ka nani o ka helehelena ke nana aku, aole hoi ona kina. A ua olelo ia ma ka moolelo o keia kaua ana, oia ka oi o Oahu nei ame ko na mokupuni e aku. A iloko o ka make ana o kana kane, o Kahahana, ua paa mua ko Kahekili manao e lawe ia Kekuapoi i wahine nana, aka, ua lilo i kana keiki ia Peapea. Ma keia lawe ana o Peapea ia Kekuapoi i wahine nana, ua huhu loa o Kahekili. Nolaila, hoouna aku o Kahekili i ka elele, e lawe mai ia Kekuapoi nana. Aole nae he loaa mai ia Peapea. A nui na elele a Kahekili i hoouna ai, aohe hiki mai o Kekuapoi, paa no ia Peapea. Alaila, hoouna hou o Kahekili i ka elele, e kii ia Peapea ame ka wahine e hele mai, a ina e noho, alaila, o ka make ko Peapea hope. A hiki ka elele i mua o Peapea, olelo aku la. A lohe o Peapea hele mai la. [ ]","Kekuapoi was highly reputed as an excellent woman with a beautiful countenance to behold, and she was faultless. It is narrated in the story of this battle, that she was the superior of Oahu here and of the other islands. On the death of her husband, Kahahana, Kahekili had determined to take Kekuapoi as his wife, but, she became his son’s, Peapea’s. At this seizure by Peapea of Kekuapoi as his wife, Kahekili was greatly angered. Hence, he dispatched a courier to fetch Kekuapoi to him, but, she was not relinquished by Peapea. Many were the messengers Kahekili sent, but Kekuapoi never came, for she was withheld by Peapea. Wherefore, Kahekili again sent the messenger to summon Peapea and his wife to appear, and should they remain, then Peapea would be punished with death. The courier having arrived in the presence of Peapea so informed him. Peapea, hearing, responded. [ ]"
"Mamua ae o ke kii ia ana o Peapea, ua hoonoho ia ka make o Peapea i na kanaka. Ua hoonoho ia elua papa, (ua olelo ia, he kanaha anana ka loa o ke ku ana o na papa elua,) ma kela aoao keia aoao o ke alanui, kahi a Peapea e hele aku ai a mua o Kahekili.

Eia nae, ua nele ia i ka wahine ole, ua lilo ia Kahekili. [ ]","Prior to the summoning of Peapea, his death-trap by men was laid out. Two boards had been arranged. It is said the length of the boards were forty fathoms, which occupied opposite sides of the path, whereby Peapea would come to the presence of Kahekili. All the men were equipped with javelins, war clubs, spear points, stones, and all death-dealing weapons. Whilst they were stationed behind the boards, Peapea approached between them. Immediately they cast all their javelins on Peapea, but they were trifles to him. Those death-dealing implements were his bathing water. However, as he journeyed towards Kahekili, there by his right hand was Kekuapoi held. He traveled in this manner into the presence of Kahekili. He had escaped death, but, he was wifeless, for Kahekili took her. [ ]"
"He ’lii kaulana loa o Kamehameha I no ke koa a me ka ikaika loa, a oia ka oi o na ’lii nui o Hawaii nei mai kahiko loa mai, nolaila, he pono e nana pokole i kona moolelo o ka noho ilihune ana, a me ka noho waiwai ana.

Keoua (First), the father of Kamehameha, was the younger brother of Kalaiopuu. Another name of Keoua was Kalaninuikupuapaikalaninui. The place where Kamehameha was raised from his childhood up, was at Halawa, in Kohala. Here he became a planter. He planted the trees which are still growing to this day, which are the noni , and other kinds. He also built the temple (heiau) of Hapuu, in Halawa. Thus were spent his days when he was poor and destitute of land. Of Kamehameha’s person, he had a large body, which looked to be solidly built, and was very broad on the shoulders. He was full formed without defects, and there was an abundance of muscles on his neck."
"O ke ’lii nui o Hawaii ia wa e noho ana o Kalaiopuu, a ua hanau nana o Kiwalao. A make o Kalaiopuu ma Waioahukini ma Kau, hooili ihola ia i ke aupuni maluna o kana keiki ponoi, o Kiwalao.","The great king of Hawaii at that time was Kalaiopuu, and Kiwalao was born to him. Before his death at Waioahukini, in Kau, Kalaiopuu left the kingdom to his own son, Kiwalao."
"Mamua ae o ka make ana o Kalaiopuu, waiho aku ia i kana olelo kauoha i na keiki, ia Kiwalao a me Kamehameha, a me na ’lii a pau loa: “E na keiki, e hoolohe mai olua, o ka hooilina o ke aupuni o Hawaii nei, oia na moku ekolu, o Kau, o Kona, o Kohala, o Kiwalao ke ’lii, oia ka hooilina o na aina.

The heir to the kingdom of Hawaii nei, comprising the three divisions of land, Kau, Kona and Kohala, shall be the chief Kiwalao. He is the heir to the lands. As regarding you, Kamehameha, there is no land or property for you; but your land and your endowment shall be the god Kaili. If, during life, your lord should molest you, take possession of the kingdom; but if the molestation be on your part, you will be deprived of the god.” These words of Kalaiopuu were fulfilled in the days of their youth, and his injunction was realized."
"Mahope o ka make ana o Kalaiopuu, hoi maila o Kamehameha me kona hooilina o ke ’kua o Kaili, a malama ihola, a hana i mau papohaku no kona akua no Kaili, ma Kona, ma Kohala. O ke ano o ka huaolelo papohaku, he heiau. Kukulu ihola o Kamehameha i na heiau: O Hikiau, ma Kaawaloa, o Keeku, ma Kahaluu, a me Keikipuipui, ma Kailua, i Kona.

[ ] Ma keia mau heiau o Kamehameha i hoomana ai i kona akua o Kaili, a pela no hoi oia i malama ai i kona hooilina, mai ko laua makuakane mai o Kalaiopuu.","After the death of Kalaiopuu, Kamehameha came away with his inheritance, the god Kaili. He took care and preserved it, building for it stone enclosures at Kona and Kohala. The meaning of stone enclosures is temples ( heiau ). Kamehameha built temples at Hikiau in Kaawaloa; at Keeku, in Kahaluu; at Keikipuipui, in Kailua, all in Kona; and at Mailekini, in Kawaihae; Puukohola, in Kawaihae; Hapuu, in Halawa; Kupalaha, in Makapala; and Mookini, in Puuepa, all in [ ] Kohala. In these temples (heiau’s) Kamehameha was wont to worship his god, Kaili, thus maintaining his endowment given to him by his uncle, Kalaiopuu."
"Oia ke kaua i ku ai o Kamehameha i ka moku o Kona, o Kohala, o Hamakua, koe ekolu moku o Hawaii, o Kau, o Puna, o Hilo. O ke kumu o keia kaua ana o ka makemake o ua ’lii o Hilo ia Kona i ka pohu, a me ka maikai, nolaila ke kaua.","This was the battle that made Kamehameha king of Kona, Kohala and Hamakua. There remained the three divisions, Kau, Puna and Hilo, in Hawaii. The cause of this war was the desire of the chiefs of Hilo to possess Kona, which has a calm and pleasant climate."
"A make o Kalaiopuu ma Waioahukini ma Kau, lawe maila na ’lii o Hilo a me Kau i ke kino kupapau o Kalaiopuu, maluna o na waa i Kona nei. Aka, aole ia o ko lakou manao maoli, aka, i hiki lakou i Kona, ka aina a lakou i makemake nui ai, alaila okioki, a kaua no hoi.

Ma keia ike ana o Keeaumoku, ua maopopo ia ia he kaua ke ano o na ’lii a me na kanaka.","When Kalaiopuu died at Waioahukini in Kau, the chiefs of Hilo and Kau brought his dead body to Kona, in canoes. That was not, however, the real object of their coming, but they came to Kona, the land that they had been longing for, to divide it up, and also to make war. On the way from Kau to Kona, they and the corpse of Kalaiopuu were caught in the rains on the ocean; therefore, they turned in and landed at Honaunau, in South Kona, without reaching Kailua, in North Kona, where they had intended to land. When they landed at Honaunau, Keeaumoku came to pay his respects to the remains of Kalaiopuu. On this occasion Keeaumoku well knew by the looks of the chiefs and the men that there was war brewing."
"Ma keia pae ana o na ’lii me ke kino kupapau o Kalaiopuu ma Honaunau, ia wa, okioki ihola na ’lii a me Kiwalao i ka aina o Hawaii, no lakou a pau. A ma ko Keeaumoku ike ana i ko lakou ano kaua, kii maila ia ia Kamehameha ma Halawa i Kohala, e hele e kaua.

Ma keia halawai ana o lakou, kuka ihola lakou i ke ano o ke kaua, a me ka hana e pono ai, a akaka ihola, holo aku la lakou a hiki ma Kaawaloa, a ma Keei.","Soon after their landing at Honaunau with the corpse of Kalaiopuu, the chiefs and Kiwalao started to divide up Hawaii among themselves, and when Keeaumoku became cognizant of their warlike designs, he came to Kamehameha, who was at Halawa, in Kohala, to go and fight. When Keeaumoku left Kona, he arrived at Kekaha, where he met Kamehameha, who had already been brought by Kekuhaupio from Kohala. At this meeting they consulted among themselves their plan of war, and their own proper proceedings; and their plans being settled upon they set sail, arriving at Kaawaloa and Keei."
"A hiki o Kamehameha malaila, hele maila o Kiwalao e aloha ia Kamehameha me na olelo pahele hoopunipuni, penei: “Auhea oe, e make ana kaua, eia no ka makuakane o kaua ke pue mai nei e kaua (oia o Keawemauhili), elua wale no paha auanei kaua e make, aloha wale kaua.” A pau ka ike ana o Kiwalao me Kamehameha hoi akula o Kiwalao a Honaunau, okioki i na aina me na ’lii, a nele o Keoua i ka aina ole, huhu ihola ia.

Ma keia kaua ana, eha alii mahope o Kamehameha, Keeaumoku, Keaweheulu, Kameeiamoku, Kekuhaupio.","When Kamehameha arrived there Kiwalao came to greet him with lying, deceitful words, thus: “Listen; we are going to lose our lives. Here is our uncle (Keawemauhili) insisting on war. It seems we two are the only ones to die. Oh! Pity us.” After the meeting between Kiwalao and Kamehameha, the former returned to Honaunau, dividing up the lands with the chiefs, thereby depriving Keoua of a share in the lands. This so enraged Keoua that he went with his followers to Keomo and cut down the coconut trees, killing a man. That man was Kamehameha’s. This was the commencement of the battle which continued for three days. In this battle there were four chiefs in defense of Kamehameha; they were Keeaumoku, Keaweaheulu, Kameeiamoku and Kekuhaupio."
"Iloko o na la i kaua ai, o Keeaumoku ke ’lii ma ko Kamehameha aoao i kaua aku, me ko Kiwalao poe kaua. Ma keia hoouka ana o Keeaumoku, ua hihia oia i ka [ ] pololu, a hina ihola ilalo, o o ihola na koa o Kiwalao i ka pahoa ia Keeaumoku ma kona kua. I keia hina ana, hou ihola kekahi koa ia Keeaumoku i ka pololu, a ua nawaliwali oia, aneane e make, me ka hua olelo kaena penei: “Ku aku la kau laau i ka aama kua lenalena.”","In the days of this battle Keeaumoku was the chief on Kamehameha’s side who contended with Kiwalao’s warriors. In the fray he got entangled with a long [ ] spear which threw him down. Kiwalao’s men then stabbed him on the back, with wooden daggers. When Keeaumoku fell a man pierced him with a long spear, whereby he became very weak and near unto death, while the man said with a taunting brag: “My spear has struck a yellow-backed crab.”"
"Alaila, pane mai o Kiwalao i ke koa nana e hou nei o Keeaumoku i ka pololu: “E malama i ka niho palaoa.” Alaila, maopopo ia Keeaumoku e make ana ia i loko o ka Kiwalao olelo ana.

A ike o Keeaumoku ua hina o Kiwalao ilalo, hooikaika aela ia, a loaa o Kiwalao, uumi ihola ia me ka leiomanu ma kona lima, a make ihola o Kiwalao.","Then Kiwalao called to the warrior who was piercing Keeaumoku with the long spear: “Save the ivory necklace,” by which Keeaumoku understood that his own death was sealed. And while he was thus lying prostrate on the ground, Kamanawa was leading the fighting against Kiwalao’s warriors. Mahoe also stood up with his sling, sending a stone which struck Kiwalao, knocking him down. When Keeaumoku saw Kiwalao fall, he crawled over with a great effort, and when he found him he throttled him with the leiomanu , which he held in his hand; and thus Kiwalao died."
"A make o Kiwalao, hoouka ihola o Kamehameha me na ’lii, a lanakila aela o Kamehameha mahuka aku la o Keoua ma ke kai a hiki i Kau noho alii. A o Keawemauhili, mahuka aku la ia ma ka mauna a noho alii maluna o Hilo a me Puna. A o Kamehameha hoi, noho alii ihola ia maluna o Kona, o Kohala, o Hamakua. A nolaila, akolu alii noho aupuni o Hawaii ia wa.","On the death of Kiwalao, Kamehameha continued the fighting, and became victorious over the opposing chiefs. Keoua fled by sea to Kau, and reigned there. Keawemauhili fled over the mountains and became ruler over Hilo and Puna, while Kamehameha became ruler over Kona, Kohala and Hamakua. Therefore there were three different rulers on Hawaii at that time."
"O ka lua keia o ko Kamehameha kaua ana i kona mau enemi, oia o Keoua a me Keawemauhili. O keia kaua ana, ma ka mauna o Kau, nolaila kela inoa, o Kauaawa, no ka ua ma ka mauna.

Mahope o keia noho ana o Kamehameha i Laupahoehoe, hele aku la ia maluna o ka waa, e kaua hou ai i Hilo a me Puna.","This was Kamehameha’s second battle against his enemies, who were Keoua and Keawemauhili. This battle took place on the mountains in Kau, which are called Kauaawa, on account of the rains in the mountains. In this battle, Kamehameha’s supporters, who were also his chief advisors in the work necessary for the battle, were Keeaumoku, Keaweaheulu, Kameeiamoku and Kamanawa. In this battle Keoua and Keawemauhili were not defeated by Kamehameha, so he retired to Laupahoehoe. After spending some time there, he again embarked in a canoe to fight for the conquest of Hilo and Puna."
"A hiki o Kamehameha ma Keaau i Puna, o Papai kahi o na lawaia e noho ana, oia ke awa a Kamehameha i pae ai.","When he arrived at Keaau, in Puna, he made a landing at Papai, where fishermen gathered for their daily vocation."
"Ma keia pae ana o Kamehameha, he mau lawaia e noho ana ma laila, alualu aku la o Kamehameha e pepehi i na lawaia. Ma keia alualu ana, ua haule o Kamehameha i loko o ka mawae a paa loa kona wawae, nolaila, oni aela ia me kona ikaika loa.","On landing at this place, where a number of fishermen dwelt, he chased after them intending to kill them, and while thus pursuing the fishermen, he fell in a crevice in the rocks where his foot caught and held him fast. Therefore he tried with all his might to extricate himself."
"Ia ia nae i haule ai i loko o ka mawae, oia ka wa i hahau ai na lawaia i ka lae o Kamehameha i ka hoe, a pa ihola ia i ka hoe. A no loko o keia pa ana o ka lae o Kamehameha i ka hoe, kela kanawai kaulana loa i kauia a hiki i na la o Kamehameha III oia [ ] ka Mamalahoa. Eia ke ano: “E hele ka elemakule a me ka luahine a moe i ke ala,” aole e pepehi wale ia, aole hao wale ia ko lakou waiwai.","When he fell in the crevice, he was struck on the forehead with a paddle by the fishermen, and on account of this fact the title of that famous law, the “ mamalahoa ,” was derived, which prevailed until the days of Kamehameha III, the interpretation [ ] of which being that old men and old women might lie down in the road without being ruthlessly killed, or robbed of their belongings."
"A no ka ikaika loa o ko Kamehameha oni ana, hemo aela kona wawae, alaila, alualu aku la ia i ke kanaka. Aia hoi, he opu ohia nui e ku ana mamua o ko Kamehameha alo, ekolu kanaka nana e apo puni ae, oia ka mea nana i keakea i ko Kamehameha hahai ana, aka, apo aku la o Kamehameha me kona mau lima ma na aoao o ke opu ohia, a loaa aku la ke kanaka ia ia, hoopio maila ia i ke kino o ke kanaka i ke opu ohia, a make ihola. A ike kekahi mau kanaka makau ihola, a holo aku la.","By a tremendous effort Kamehameha extricated his foot and chased after the men. There was a large clump of ohia trees in his way which could not be encircled by less than three men. This obstructed Kamehameha from chasing after the men, but he reached around one side of the clump of ohias till he caught one of the men, whose body he bent over towards the clump of ohias, and thus killed him. When the other men saw this they were fearfully alarmed and ran away."
"O kekahi hoike ana o Kamehameha i kona ikaika. Ia ia i hele ai me kona kahu ponoi me Hema, i loko o ke kaua a Keoua ma Koapapaa i Kekualele, ma Kealakaha, ma Hamakua, he kahawai hohonu manao loa ia, a he haiki loa o lalo o ka honua, o ke kahawai, iho aku la o Kamehameha me Hema, a hiki ia wahi haiki, halawai maila na koa o Keoua me Kamehameha.

There was a deep ravine, and very narrow at the bottom. Kamehameha and Hema went down till they reached this limited space, when they met Keoua’s warriors. Forty of them with their spears and javelins jumped on Kamehameha, but they were as nothing to him. He stretched out his hands, caught the warriors, and broke them in two, one after another, all of the time moving onward. Thus Kamehameha slaughtered the soldiers until there remained only ten, when he became exhausted. He then told his servant, “Say, help me out.” Hema immediately jumped into the fray, killing the remaining ten; and on that day he became a chief of Kamehameha, being released from his position of attendant."
"O keia ke kolu o na kaua a Kamehameha i kona aupuni; ma Maui keia kaua ana, ma ke kahawai o Iao, ma Wailuku. O keia kekahi o na kaua kaulana loa a Kamehameha no ka nui o na waa, no ka nui o na kanaka, no ka paa ana o ka wai o Iao.

Ua olelo ia ka nui o na waa ia holo hookahi ana mai, ua pani ia ke awa mai Keoneoio a Olowalu e na waa, aole wahi kaawale.","This is the third of Kamehameha’s battles during his reign, and was fought out at Maui, in the Valley of Iao, at Wailuku. It was one of the most renowned of Kamehameha’s battles, on account of the great number of canoes, of the people, and of the damming of the waters of Iao. This trip of the canoes from Hawaii was called the Great Fleet, which was the first trip of Kamehameha’s large peleleu (canoes) to Maui. It is said that the canoes which came in this single trip were so numerous that they covered the whole landing place from Keoneoio to Olowalu without a space intervening."
"Ma ke kaua ana ma Iao, ua hee o Kalaikupule ia Kamehameha, a mahuka aku la ma ka waa a noho i Oahu.

[ ]","In the battle at Iao, Kalaikupule was defeated by Kamehameha, the former fleeing in a canoe and going to Oahu. In this battle the slaughter of the people of Maui was so great that the stream and valley of Iao was dammed that the water receded upward and did not flow downward as it does now. On account of the great number of people slain and the great number of deaths of people rolling down the precipice, that battle was known under three famous appellations. They are: Kepaniwai, Kauwaupali, and Iao. In this war Maui became a possession of Kamehameha to this day of writing, and no one has ever denounced the powerful arm of Kamehameha to this day. [ ]"
"O keia kaua ana, he kaua poa na Keoua, a hala o Kamehameha i Maui, a Molokai, a Kaunakahakai hiki maila ka elele mai Hawaii mai, e hai mai ana i ko Keoua paia i ko Kamehameha mau makaainana, hao wale i ka waiwai, pepehi wale i ke kane me ka wahine, ke keiki, kokohi ku i ke kalo i waena, a me na hana ino a pau loa. Na wahine hapai keiki, hehihehi ia me ka wawae, pahu ia me ke ulili liilii, a me ka laau, ka pohaku.","This battle was a secret invasion by Keoua. When Kamehameha had gone to Maui and then to Molokai, at Kaunakahakai, a messenger arrived from Hawaii, apprising him of Keoua’s cruelty to his (Kamehameha’s) subjects, by robbing them of their property, by the wantonly killing of men, women and children, the cutting of taro from the fields with overbearing arrogance, and all other malicious acts. Women who were with child were trampled under foot, pierced with small bambus and with sticks and stones."
"A lohe o Kamehameha i keia mau hana a Keoua, hu mai kona aloha i na makaainana o kona mau moku ekolu, o Kona, o Kohala, o Hamakua, i ka luku wale ia e Keoua me ka hoomainoino, a me ka pono ole, alaila, pau ko Kamehameha manao ana e holo i Oahu.

Kamehameha then abandoned his idea of going to Oahu. He went back to Hawaii and fought Keoua in Hamakua, where Keoua was defeated and escaped to Kau, and afterwards died at Kawaihae, in Kohala. That battle was called Koapapaa. Here is the explanation of the name: the warriors of Keoua were reduced by death, and were as nothing before Kamehameha and his warriors, and were left on the ground as a lot of logs piled up in an umu (underground oven), and very much scorched by the heat of the fire."

Before his arrival the umu had been prepared and was red hot. Keoua was then roasted. And thus Keoua was killed by Kamehameha, who came into possession of Kau, making four divisions of land in Hawaii, in his possession, namely, Kau, Kona, Kohala and Hamakua."
"O ka lima keia o ko Kamehameha kaua ana me na ’lii kipi, oia o Kahekili a me Kaeo. Hala maila o Kaeo mai Kauai mai a Oahu, loaa o Kahekili.

The latter came from Kauai to Oahu and met Kahekili, both going to Hawaii, and at Kohala fought Kamehameha. They were defeated. In this [ ] vanquishment, the people of Kauai, and of Oahu and of Maui were slaughtered by Kamehameha and his warriors, so that the corpses of the people floated on the sea outside of Kohala, and looked red; hence the appellation Kepuwahaulaula. The head and the skin of the corpses were as red as the gun."
"A lohe o Kamehameha ua make o Kahekili ma Oahu, a ua lilo ka noho alii o Oahu ia Kalaikupule, kana keiki, alaila, holo maila o Kamehameha a hiki ma Oahu, kaua ihola me Kalaikupule ma ka pali kaulana o Nuuanu, a hee aela o Kalaikupule ia Kamehameha.

A ma keia kaua ana, ua puni na mokupuni a pau loa ia Kamehameha, Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Kauai.","When Kamehameha heard that Kahekili had died in Oahu, and that the government of Oahu was under the control of Kalaikupule, his son, he set sail and arrived at Oahu, where he fought Kalaikupule at the famous pali of Nuuanu. Kalaikupule was defeated by Kamehameha. In this battle the people of Oahu were massacred at the cliffs of Nuuanu. The people stepped upon each other, and the people that day were in heaps at the bottom of the cliffs of Nuuanu. And by this battle the whole group of islands, including Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe and Kauai, was conquered by Kamehameha."
"Oia kekahi alii koa kaulana loa Oahu nei, i na la o Kalaikupule ko Oahu nei alii nui. Ua kaulana loa ia no ke koa a me ke akamai, o ka ihe, ka pololu, ka elau, he wai auau ia nona.

He (Pihana) was noted for his bravery and skill; the use of the spear, the lance, the javelin, were as a bath to him; his joys and pleasures; he could fight other people and many of them with the help of but a few soldiers."
"Oia ke kaua ana o Kamehameha me Kalaikupule ma Nuuanu. O Kalaimoku ko Kamehameha pukaua nui, mai Hawaii mai, a o Pihana ko Kalaikupule pukaua nui.","This was the battle between Kamehameha and Kalaikupule at Nuuanu. Kalaimoku was Kamehameha’s chief warrior, from Hawaii, and Pihana was Kalaikupule’s chief warrior."

[ ]","When Kamehameha with his many soldiers came over from Hawaii in his canoes, the first of the canoe fleet in charge of Kalaimoku, Kamehameha’s chief warrior, landed at Kapua. Just as Kalaimoku was about to disembark, Pihana, with his nine soldiers, came and stood at the landing place of Kapua. The fight then commenced. The men from Hawaii under Kalaimoku, at that time, were eight times forty in number. All of them threw their spears and lances at Pihana and his nine soldiers, but none were hit nor were any killed. After they had fought for some time, they moved to Waikiki where the fighting was renewed. Here the Hawaii men tried to mob Pihana, but were unsuccessful. The fighting kept moving thence to Kulaokahua, then to Puowaina, behind which a man of the Oahu warriors was secretly shot by a foreigner’s gun. From that place they moved on to Pauoa, and passing this place came to Kaheiki, a place adjacent to Maemae. Here the Hawaii forces came to a stand. [ ]"
"O Kalaikupule a me ka poe kaua, mauka lakou o Waolani kahi i hoomoana ai, a o kona pukaua o Pihana, oia ka mea nana e hoouka ana me Kalaimoku. O Kalaimoku a me ka poe koa o Hawaii, he poe okoa ia, ua paa o waho i ka upena nae, oia ka pa o waho o na kanaka, ina mawaho ke kanaka, alaila, he Oahu ia, ina maloko o ka upena he Hawaii ia. Ma keia hana ana ku mai o Pihana me kona mau koa eiwa, a hoouka me Kalaimoku, ma ia hoouka ana, aole i hee o Pihana me kona mau koa.","Kalaikupule and his warriors were encamped above at Waolani , and it was only his chief warrior, Pihana, that was battling with Kalaimoku. Kalaimoku and the Hawaii soldiers were distinguished by being surrounded by a fine-meshed net, which was the outside enclosure for the men; if a man was on the outside, then he was an Oahuan; if within the net enclosure, he was a Hawaii man. On account of this action, Pihana and his nine men stood up and fought Kalaimoku, in which engagement Pihana and his men were not defeated."
"Nolaila, nonoi aku o Kalaimoku ia Pihana, e hooki i kona kaua ana mai a e haawi mai ia Oahu nei no Kamehameha. Olelo mai o Pihana: “Alia au e haawi aku ia oe i ka aina, aia a pau kuu auau ana i ka laau a Hawaii, ekolu la i koe, alaila, waiho aku au i ka aina i kou lima.” Alaila, ku mai o Pihana hookahi imua o na koa o Hawaii, hou na kanaka i ka ihe a me ka pololu, a me ka elau, nou ka pohoku, alaila, he alo wale no ka Pihana hana. Pela kona ku ana a maloeloe, moe ilalo, a pau ia, huli iluna ke alo, a pau ia, hoopohopoho ka lemu iluna, hou no o Hawaii i ka ihe a me ka pololu, aka, aohe ku o Pihana.","Therefore Kalaimoku asked Pihana to cease his resisting and to cede Oahu to Kamehameha. Pihana replied: “I will not give you the land until I have bathed myself in Hawaii’s medicine (weapons). In three days I shall leave the land in your hands.” Then Pihana stood alone before the soldiers from Hawaii. They cast their spears and lances and javelins, and threw stones at him, but Pihana simply dodged them. Thus he stood until tired when he laid down, face downward, and then on his back. He then stooped and exhibited his posterior in vulgar defiance, and in all that time the men from Hawaii were casting their spears and javelins at him without hitting him. The men from Hawaii, looking at him found no one among many equal to him in agility and daring."
"Ma ka nana ana a na koa o Hawaii, aole e loaa kona lua, i ke akamai a me ke koa luaole i loko o ka lehulehu. A hala elua la, nee aku la o Pihana a hiki i ka poe, oia ke kaua nui loa, hahae aku la o Pihana i ka upena o waho, a ku aku la ma ka waha, aole nae he ihe hou mai a me ka pololu, no ka makau ia Pihana. I ke kolu o ka la, ku hou o Pihana e kaua me na koa o Hawaii, a hele aku la o Pihana a loaa o Kalaimoku haawi aku la i ka aina ia Kalaimoku, nolaila, pio ai o Kalaikupule.","After two days had passed Pihana joined his forces, which was the time of the great battle. He tore the surrounding net and stood at the opening. No spear nor lance was hurled, the dread of Pihana being so great. On the third day Pihana again came forward to fight with the warriors from Hawaii. He went up to Kalaimoku and ceded the land to him. Therefore Kalaikupule was vanquished."
"Mahope o ko Kamehameha kaua ana ma Oahu me Kalaikupule, kipi o Namakaeha ma Hilo, he ’lii no e noho ana malaila, a hoomakaukau ihola oia e kaua me Kamehameha.

At that time Kamehameha was on Oahu, and he immediately returned to Hawaii , to fight Namakaeha. In the battle which ensued Namakaeha was slain by Kamehameha at Kaipalaoa, in Hilo. This was the last battle by Kamehameha when he assumed the administration of his whole kingdom from Hawaii to Niihau, in which he reigned peacefully to the day of his death. On the consolidation of these Islands from Hawaii to Niihau under one great ruler, Kamehameha, with all the chiefs under him, he established his policy and wisdom over all his kingdom with uprightness."

This is how he arranged the work of his kingdom: Kamehameha was the great ruler over all. There were four chief executives under him: these were Keeaumoku, [ ] Keaweaheulu, Kameeiamoku and Kamanawa. There were also advisors and counselors in the affairs of the kingdom. There were four of them: Kai, Kapalaoa, Kaaloa and Kauakahiakaola. With these people Kamehameha carried out all of his works, and through them important laws were made, which carried great influence upon the people, such as the Mamalahoa and the Maumae , “that the old and the infirm might lie down in the road and not be molested.”"

The word lua-apana means doing nothing, spending time in laziness. The word kikoola means robbing others of their property, and perjuring."
"Ua malama oia i na makaainana mehe keiki la, a me kana mau wahine, ua hoonoho i mau kiaiai.

He, with his chiefs and the men of his court, cultivated the land and the result of which was that most noted field of Kuahewa, in upper Kailua, North Kona, Hawaii. It was most noted for its great size and length. It comprised eight divisions of land, about seven miles."
"O ka waiwai nui i loko o ko Kamehameha noho aupuni ana, o ka iliahi, he laau aala loa ia, a he laau waiwai loa, ua ulu ia laau ma na mauna, a ma na aina nahelehele loa.

The feathers of the birds, of the oo and other birds, were made into feather cloaks for the chiefs and the warriors."
"O ka nui o ko Kamehameha mau makahiki o ka noho aupuni ana, ehiku ia, a make ihola ia i ka walu o na makahiki, oia ka makahiki o ka Haku 1819.

He died at Kailua, in Kona, Hawaii, and it was there that Liholiho was set apart as heir to his (Kamehameha’s) kingdom."
"O ke kumu o keia kipi ana o Kekuaokalani, o ka noa ana o ka ai kapu, o ko Liholiho ae ana i ka ainoa, oia ke kumu i huhu ai o Kekuaokalani a manao ai e kaua, e luku [ ] i ka poe ainoa.

Ainoa, eia ke ano; he ai pu ke kane me kana wahine, he nohopu i ka hale hookahi, a pela aku.","The cause for this insurgency of Kekuaokalani was on account of the raising of the restrictions, and Liholiho allowing the same to be done; this angered Kekuaokalani, who threatened to make war and destroy the reformers. Here is the meaning [ ] of Aikapu: The husband ate by himself, had a separate house, a separate oven, and so forth; so did the wife. They were separated in their social life. Ainoa means: The husband and his wife eat together, dwelt in the same house, and so forth."
"A make o Kamehameha, ili ke aupuni ia Liholiho. A o Kekuaokalani hoi, aole ona makemake ia Liholiho e ainoa ke aupuni, makemake oia e aikapu, nolaila, aua oia ia Liholiho, aka, hoole o Kaahumanu a me na ’lii, aohe makemake e aikapu.

Kekuaokalani did not want Liholiho to remove the restrictions of the kingdom; he was in favor of aikapu , therefore he opposed Liholiho, but Kaahumanu and the chiefs refused to continue the restrictions. The cause of this reformation was the death of Kamehameha. All the people went into mourning, and it was during that time that the husband and wife ate together, eating all foods that were restricted, and thus ainoa spread down to the battle at Kuamoo with Kekuaokalani."
"A lohe o Kekuaokalani ua ainoa o Liholiho a me na ’lii a pau loa, holo aku la ia a noho ma Kawaaloa, me kana wahine o Manono.

He then prepared to rebel and to fight against the ainoa people. Then two chiefs, Naihe and Hoapili, set sail from Kailua to Kaawaloa. They said to Kekuaokalani: “We have come to bring you back to your nephew and reside at Kailua, and it shall be as you desire whether the restrictions be continued or raised. But that shall be as you desire.” Kekuaokalani then said: “You two tarry here until Manono hears about it. Tomorrow I will tell you.”"
"Moe ihola lakou a ao aela, hele maila o Kekuaokalani a ma ke alo o Hoapili a me Naihe, olelo aku laua: “O ka holo keia o kakou?” ae aku o Kekuaokalani, “Ae.” Aka, aole ona ae io, he manao kaua kona. Noia mea, olelo aku o Naihe me Hoapili: “Wehe i ka piko la e na hoahanau.”","They rested there, and in the morning Kekuaokalani came to the presence of Hoapili and Naihe. They then asked, “Are we going?” Kekuaokalani said “Yes,” but his assent was not real. He was bent on war. Wherefore Naihe and Hoapili said: “The navel is cut then, companion.”"
"Mahope olaila, hoi maila o Hoapili me Naihe, a hiki ma Kailua olelo akula ia Kalaimoku: “E hoomakaukau no ke kaua, a makaukau na waa eiwa, hele maila mauka.” A hiki o Kalaimoku ma Lekeleke, hoomaka ke kaua na kiu o Kekuaokalani, ma keia kaua ana, hee o Kalaimoku a make kekahi mau kanaka ona.

Nine war canoes were made ready. Kalaimoku marched overland, and when he came to Lekeleke, the battle commenced with Kekuaokalani’s scouts. In this battle Kalaimoku was defeated and a number of his men were killed. They again met at Kuamoo, where they fought from morning till evening when Kekuaokalani was killed. He was hit in the leg by a bullet, the effects of which rendering him very weak. His wife Manono remained safe."
"He wahine maikai loa o Manono, a he nani kona helehelena ke nana aku, oia kai hea mai ia Kalaimoku a me na koa, penei: Kahea mai o Manono, “E ola maua e! Aole e ola i ka waha o ka pu.” I aku o Kalaimoku: “Aole oe e ola, no ka mea, ua make ke ’lii,” nolaila, ki ia aku la i ka pu, a make ihola.","Manono was a very beautiful woman and her face very fair to look upon. She called to Kalaimoku and the men thus: “O spare us two! There is no safety before the mouth of a gun.” Kalaimoku then said: “You shall not live, because the chief has been killed.” Therefore she was shot and died soon after."
"A make o Kekuaokalani ma Kuamoo, me kana wahine o Manono, hoi maila o Kalaimoku me na koa a hiki ma Kailua, ahaolelo ihola lakou a holo, e kii e kaua i kela kipi ma Waipio, i Hamakua, oia o Kainapau makaainana.

They held a consultation and decided to make war upon that other insurgent, Kainapau, a commoner, residing at Waipio, in Hamakua. Kalaimoku and his men then set sail and arrived at Kawaihae. From here they marched up to Waimea, arriving at a place called Pahupahua, near Mahiki, where the fighting occurred. In the melee the rebels were annihilated and Kainapau overthrown. He fled to the uttermost backwoods of Waipio, hiding there, and [ ] while so doing, was found by the searchers. Kainapau was killed on the spot, and his intestines strung out to dry in the sun. That is the dreadful end of the evil-minded, the rebellious and the wrong-doer, a horrible death."
"Oia kekahi koa kaulana loa i loko o ko Kamehameha mau la, a he kanaka makau ole i ko hai koa a me ka ikaika.

I ka wa hele mao a mao, i ka wa kaua, oia ka mea lawe ai, i ka wa e kaua ai o Kamehameha a pololi, alaila lawe aku o Hema i ka ai a me kahi ia.","Hema was one of the most famous warriors in the days of Kamehameha, and a man who was not afraid of the bravery and strength of others. Hema was not trained to be a warrior, or in the art of war. He was not accustomed to the waging of wars, and was never a warrior. He was a steward of Kamehameha, and his duties were to take and keep in charge rations for the king every day. While going abroad in war times he was the bearer of food, and when a battle was in progress and Kamehameha became hungry, then Hema would bring him provisions."
"Ma keia mau hana a pau loa i pili i ka aipuupuu, ua makaukau loa o Hema, a ua kupono i ko Kamehameha makemake, aka, aole i loaa kona inoa alii, a me ke kaulana a me ka punahele.

"Ia Kamehameha e kaua ana me Keoua, ma Koapapaa, i Hamakua, aia kela wahi ma Kealakaha e pili la me Kaula, ma kela kahawai nui hohonu, o Kekualele kona inoa, ilalo o laila i hoouka ai na koa ikaika o Keoua me Kamehameha.

At that particular place the standing room was only a fathom in width, and it was there Kamehameha fought against forty or more of Keoua’s warriors. After considerable fighting Kamehameha was very much out of breath, and the men of Keoua were being reinforced. Just then Kamehameha expectantly turned to the rear; but there were no chiefs, nor warriors behind him, only Hema the steward. While Kamehameha was talking to Hema, the enemies were preparing to take Kamehameha’s life, but Hema fearlessly leapt forward and slew the warriors of Keoua. By this work of Hema in leaping forward to repulse the enemies, Kamehameha was victorious that day, and his life was saved, and Keoua defeated. Hence the name Koapapaa until this day, which means that the warriors became a storehouse of death and the lance and the spear the pathway, here and there. The warriors were left there in that valley, a pile of earth."
"A ike o Kamehameha i ke koa lua ole o Hema, olelo aku la ia: “I keia la oe e lilo ai i alii elike me a’u, a i keia la e waiho oe i ka lawe, a me ke amo i ka ukana, a e lilo oe i punahele ma ko’u alo a me kona ’lii, a pela na makaainana. O ka mea hoole i kau olelo, e make ia, ina he ’lii ka mea hoole, e hemo kona aina.” Nolaila, ua kiekie o Hema a hala ia i ka make, a ua kaulana loa no hoi iloko o ko Kamehameha mau la. Nolaila, ma ka noonoo ana, aole paha he kanaka e noho ana ma na aina puniole, a me na moku o ke kai i ao ole i ke akamai o ke koa, a hele e kaua e like me Hema, ka mea ao ole ia. [ ]","When Kamehameha witnessed the matchless bravery of Hema, he said: “Today you become a chief as I am, and today you refrain from carrying and shouldering baggage, and you shall be a courtier in my presence, and in the presence of the chiefs and the people also. He who disobeys your word shall die. If the delinquent be a chief he shall lose his lands.” Therefore Hema was exalted until his death, and was very famous in the days of Kamehameha. On reflection, therefore, perhaps there never was a man on the continents, or on the Isles of the Sea, who had never studied the requirements of a warrior, and who did go to war as Hema was, the unlearned.

"Oia kekahi koa kaulana loa i ko Kamehameha mau la, a he koa akamai loa no hoi. Ua olelo ia, i loko o kona mau la kaua, he hiki no ia ia ke ku imua o ka lehulehu e kaua ai me ka makau ole, ina he nui, a he lehulehu kona mau enemi ma kekahi aoao, he hiki no ia ke pale aku.

A ua makau no hoi o Kamehameha ia Nalu, no keia mea i ke koa a me ke akamai o Nalu. [ ]","Nalu was a very celebrated warrior during Kamehameha’s reign, and was an accomplished soldier. It is said that in his fighting days he could stand and fight fearlessly against an overwhelming number of his enemies and beat them, because he gloried in the use of the lance, the spear, the javelin, the cudgel, the stone ax and the encircling pikoi rope. Nalu was therefore greatly feared in his warrior days and fighting in battles. No land division chief would dare and fight him; no warrior, no land, or island would dare and fight Nalu, his great strength being the source of fear among all. Kamehameha was also apprehensive of Nalu on account of the latter’s accomplishments in bravery and skill. [ ]"
"He kanaka maalea loa o Kekuawahine i ka pahele, a me ka hoopunipuni. He hiki ia ia ke hoolilo i ka oiaio ole i oiaio, i ka pololei i pololei ole, a pela aku no.

When Kamehameha was residing at Pakaka, Kona, Oahu (that is the place where “White man Jim” lives), at the time that the islands from Hawaii to Niihau were subjugated by him, he was living with his wife, Kaahumanu. Kanaihalau was an uncle of Kaahumanu, whom she placed in power over Hamakua, Kawaihae and Waimea. These lands are on Hawaii, and of course, Kanaihalau became very much favored by his niece, Kaahumanu. On this account Kekuawahine and all the chiefs were very envious of him, and could not get along together at Waimea and Kawaihae. Therefore Kekuawahine meditated on a plan of action."
"O Kanaihalau, aia no oia e hooponopono ana i ka aina me kona hope. Elua nae laua, o Kanaihalau, o Malaihi, oia na ’lii maluna o Hamakua, Waimea, Kawaihae. O Malaihi, ma Oahu nei no ia kahi i noho ai me Kekuawahine. Ia laua e noho pu ana, olelo aku la o Kekuawahine ia Malaihi: “E hele kaua a kokoke aku i ke alo o Kamehameha, noho iho oe, owau ke hele aku e kamailio pu me Kamehameha, alaila, nana ae oe i ku’u kamailio.” Mahope o keia kamailio ana, hele aku la laua a kokoke, noho ihola o Malaihi.","Kanaihalau was then with his deputy, superintending the lands. There were two of them, however, Kanaihalau and Malaihi, who were chiefs over Hamakua, Waimea and Kawaihae. Malaihi was at Oahu, residing with Kekuawahine, and while thus living together, Kekuawahine said to Malaihi: “Let us go until we come near to the presence of Kamehameha; you will then stay behind, and I will go forward and have conversation with Kamehameha, while you will watch me talk.” After this conference they set forth, and when they were near enough, Malaihi remained behind."
"Ma keia noho ana a Malaihi, olelo aku o Kekuawahine, penei: “Eia au ke hele nei a kamailio me Kamehameha, e nana pono ko maka ia’u, mai lalau oe, no ka mea, o ka la keia make o Kanaihalau ia kaua. Ina i kuhi ku’u lima o ko Kanaihalau make ia, ina i kulou ku’u poo a kunou i hope nei, alaila o ko kii ia a pepehi ia Kanaihalau. Nolaila, e noho oe e nana, e hele au e kamailio me Kamehameha.” Hele aku la o Kekuawahine a hiki ma waho o ka pa o Kamehameha, ku aku la nana i ke kamailio a Kamehameha me na ’lii. Ia lakou e kamailio ana, kuhi aku la ko Kekuawahine lima i kai, a pau ia, nana maila ihope nei a kunou maila, a pau keia mau mea ia ia i ka hana, hoi maila ia a hiki imua o Malaihi.","As Malaihi did so, Kekuawahine spoke as follows: “I am now going to have a talk with Kamehameha. Keep your eyes on me, and do not wander, because on this day we will seal Kanaihalau’s death. If I stretch out my hand, that is the signal for Kanaihalau’s death. If I bow down and nod back toward here, then that is a sign for you to go and kill Kanaihalau. So you remain and watch while I go and talk with Kamehameha.” Kekuawahine then proceeded to the outside of Kamehameha’s fence and stood there watching Kamehameha chatting with the chiefs. And while they were talking Kekuawahine stretched his arm toward the sea, and afterwards looked to the rear and nodded. After performing these movements, he returned to Malaihi."
"A hiki o Kekuawahine imua o Malaihi, i aku la ia ia Malaihi: “Ea, ua ike ae nei no paha oe ia’u i ke kuhi o ku’u lima i kai?” “Ae” aku o Malaihi, “ae.” “A ua ike ae nei no oe ia’u i ke kunou o ku’u poo i hope nei?” “Ae” mai o Malaihi, “ae.” Alaila, olelo aku o Kekuawahine ia Malaihi: “E hoi oe i Hawaii i keia la, a hiki oe, pepehi oe ia Kanaihalau a make.”","When he had come before Malaihi, he said: “Well, you saw me perhaps stretch my hand toward the sea?” Malaihi answered: “Yes.” “And you saw me nodding my head to the rear here?” Malaihi answered: “Yes.” Then Kekuawahine said to Malaihi: “You go back to Hawaii today, and when you arrive kill Kanaihalau.”"
"Mahope o keia mau olelo, hoi la o Malaihi a hiki i Hawaii, a pae ma Kawaihae, pii aku la ia a hala o Waimea, hiki i Hamakua, loaa o Kanaihalau e noho ana ma Eleio i Waikoekoe.

He then went up and passed Waimea, arriving at Hamakua. He found Kanaihalau residing at Eleio, in Waikoekoe. Kanaihalau was then murdered, the bones were stripped of the flesh and bundled up in mats, hence the expression “Kanaihalau Paahu” [ ] to this day. The death of Kanaihalau was reported to Kaahumanu in Oahu, who thereupon began to wail until she came into the presence of Kamehameha, and when Kamehameha heard of the occurrence, he commanded that Malaihi be killed. Thus died those chiefs."
"Oia kekahi koa kaulana o Kamehameha, i ke kaua ana Oahu nei me Kamehameha ma Nuuanu. O Kaalamakaoikuwa ko Oahu nei koa, e noho ana ia ma Luahenewai, ma Waikiki kai.

Kaalamakaoikuwa was the warrior of Oahu, and resided at Luahenewai, Waikiki-kai. Makaioulu with a companion warrior, Naaimokuokama by name, came and met Kaalamakaoikuwa. Instantly Makaioulu was seized and held prisoner, while Naaimokuokama ran away. And while he was running, Makaioulu called after him: “Do you run away and leave me?” When Naaimokuokama heard this he stopped. Makaioulu then said: “Hurl that spear that you hold in your hand straight to my navel.” Naaimokuokama did so, and at the same time that he did, Makaioulu dodged to one side, the spear striking Kaalamakaoikuwa and killing him. Makaioulu escaped, and they went thence to Puowaina."
"Ilaila e noho ana he umi koa, ike maila lakou ia laua, hou like maila lakou i na ihe he umi. Ia lakou e hou ana, huli ae la o Makaioulu i hope, a olelo aku i kona kokoolua: “E! hou lakou la i ku’u alo, kunihi oe; i hou lakou i ku’u aoao, ma ka akau oe o’u e ku ai, mai imo oe o ku oe.” Alaila, huli aku la o Makaioulu hele imua, a hiki ia io lakou la he umi, ia lakou e hou ana, alo ae la o Makaioulu hala, a hala ka lakou ihe, e huelepo iho ana o Makaioulu i kana laau palau, loaa eono kanaka, pakele aku eha.","Here were ten soldiers, who when they saw the two, pointed their ten spears at them at the same time. And while they were doing this, Makaioulu turned rearward and said to his companion: “Say, if they hurl their spears to my front, you stand sideways; and if they hurl at my side you stand at my right. Do not wink or you will be hit.” Makaioulu then faced about and went forward. And when he came near to the ten men they hurled spears at him. He dodged and the spears missed him. As their spears missed him, Makaioulu made a sweep with his war club which caught six men, four escaping."
"Malaila aku laua o ka hele ana a hiki i Niuhelewai, e noho ana o Kupaka ilaila, he koa kaulana no Kahahana, ke ’lii nui Oahu nei mamua aku o Kalaikupule. A hiki laua ilaila, hou maila ia ia Makaioulu i kana ihe, aole i ku, aka, pakele nae o Makaioulu mai make, no ka mea, ma ka lima hema kana laau. A make ihola o Kupaka ia Makaioulu.","They went thence to Niuhelewai where Kupaka was stopping. He was a celebrated warrior of Kahahana, the great chief of Oahu, before the reign of Kalaikupule. When the two arrived at the place, Kupaka made a lunge with his spear at Makaioulu without result; Makaioulu, however, had a narrow escape from death, because he had his club in his left hand. Kupaka was, however, killed by Makaioulu."
"Hele aku la laua a hiki ma Kalauao i Ewa, ilaila i halawai ai laua me ka poe koa he nui loa, a puni o Makaioulu, alaila, noonoo ihola ia i mea nona e pakele ai i loko o ka lima o ka lehulehu, a loaa ihola.

He considered a way for his escape from the hands of these people, and at last found it. He said to them: “If you all were to fight me, it will be to your shame. The best way is that one of you engage me, that is right; but if you mob me you will be ashamed, because I am only one.” They consented and stood up one by one. By so doing they were all killed by Makaioulu."
"A haalele o Makaioulu ia Ewa, hele aku la ia ma Waianae a ka puu o Kapolei, ma kona aoao komohana, halawai oia me kekahi kanaka poa, e noho ana ma kapa alanui, he kanaka me ka laau kuia, kekahi mea make o Hawaii nei.

At the hill of Kapolei, on its western side, he met a robber who was sitting on the edge of the road, with a kuia stick in his hands, a war weapon of Hawaii nei. When he came up to the man Makaioulu uttered his greetings, but the other would not respond. Makaioulu turned and proceeded on his way. The man then hurled his kuia which Makaioulu noticed by the shadow which passed over his head. He parried the kuia with his club and then turned and said: “Here, I am going to kill you; for I greeted you with love and you did not respond, and I see that murder was on your mind.” Just then the man [ ] started to run with all speed. Makaioulu chased after until he caught him, grabbed him by the neck, turned the face upward and killed him. Then Makaioulu went from that place till he came to Makua, where he met two women who understood the art of breaking bones, and where he came near being killed; but because of his own skill and knowledge of the art himself he escaped death, and the women were killed by him."
"He kukini mama loa ia i loko o ko Kamehameha I mau la, ua kaulana loa ia, aohe ona lua.

Ua like ka loihi me na mile he kanawalu, mai ka hele ana a ka hoi ana.","Makoa was a very fast runner in the days of Kamehameha I, and was far-famed, having no equal. Kamehameha was once sojourning at the sea beach at Kawaihae. From there to Hilo, at Waiakea, is a very great distance, interspersed with rough road, gulches and deep ravines. The distance is about eighty miles, going and coming."
"I ka wa e ai ai ka aina kakahiaka o Kamehameha, a mama ka awa, aohe pupu e inu pu ai me ka awa, alaila, o ka nanawa ia o Makoa e holo ai i Hilo i ka anae o ka loko o Waiakea, aia ma ka palena e pili la me Puna.

As soon as he received the mullet Makoa returned to Kamehameha, arriving with the fish still quivering, not dead. Then Kamehameha drank his awa down followed by eating the mullet to remove the bitter taste of the awa. The return of Makoa was yet in the morning time, not at noon. The distance to be traveled at the present time would take four days, going quickly and back, without baggage, but with some difficulties, stiffness and soreness."
"Oia kekahi kukini mama loa i ko Kamehameha mau la . Ua hiki ia ia ke holo mai Kailua, ma Kona akau a hiki i Waiakea ma Hilo, no ka manawa pokole loa.

He could run from Kailua, in North Kona, to Waiakea, in Hilo, in a very short time. The distance from Kailua to Hilo is about one hundred miles, going and coming, as there were three divisions of land to be traversed, namely, Kohala, Hamakua and Hilo, and the same on the return. Only three divisions, but they abounded in rocks, and very rough. The road was very crooked and the precipices very steep and craggy."
"He mea mau ia Kamehameha aia a hiki i kona wa e ai ai, alaila, kii i ia i Waiakea ma Hilo, oia ka anae loko.

And when he got them, he returned and placed the fish, still alive and quivering, on Kamehameha’s plate, which fish Kamehameha ate. That was the speed of Kaneakaehu mentioned in this writing as witnessed by people of old and known to the young people of today."

Hana, in Maui, was the birthplace of Keliimalolo. One day he and his companions left Hana, sailing for and arriving at Kapakai, in Kohala, Hawaii. On arriving at Kapakai, Keliimalolo left without helping to draw the canoes up. He went along the beach and arrived at Kawaihae, Puako and Kaniku, successively. Thence on to Kiholo, [ ] Mahaiula, Kaelehuluhulu, Kailua, Holualoa, Kahaluu, Keauhou, and Kaawaloa. At this place he lost the road (because it was covered by the sea, a fording place until this day). Keliimalolo left two joints of sugar-cane there, and returned."

From thence to a coconut grove at an open place, where a salt works’ implements were piled up.”"
"Ia Keliimalolo e olelo ana, i mai kamaaina: “Kanaka wahahee oe, o Kawaihae ke awa one, nona ka heiau iluna o ka puu o Puukohola, o Mailekini ka inoa.

The sandy landing is Kawaihae, to which belongs the temple on the hill of Puukohola. Mailekini was the name of the heiau. How could you get there? You have just gone and returned this early morning; how could you get there and return? It takes two days to go over, and on the fourth day arrive here again.”"

When I passed this I continued on on the volcanic rocks until I came to where kou trees were growing, and a patch of dry sand; from there to a sharp-pointed cape; and I went till I came to where the kou and the coconut were growing. Further on I came to a very large coconut grove, and when I passed this I came upon a bay running far inland. Then the road was lost. There I left my two joints of sugar-cane, and returned and have just arrived.”"

Therefore they disputed, and the dispute being at intense heat, they made a wager. And when the stakes were up, inquirers went to the places that Keliimalolo had gone over, and when they came to Kawaihae, the people of the place acknowledged that they had seen the runner going along the beach in the early morning. Thus they went questioning along all the sea beaches until they came to Kaawaloa. There they found the two joints of sugar-cane that Keliimalolo had left. Then they found that all the words of Keliimalolo were true, and that they all had lost their wagers to him."

Mahope o keia mau hana, noho ihola o Keliimalolo me kana wahine a me kona mau kaikuahine i uka o Keolewa, aia no ia wahi ma Kohala e pili la me ka puu o Puuhue.","The distance traveled in going and coming, was about ninety miles. It is a very bad place to this day; full of rocks; tortuous up and down; zigzagging in and out, up and down; a very long cape in some places, a hot burning sun in another place. And if people were traveling in their natural speed without baggage, it would take [ ] about one week to go and return. But to Keliimalolo, it was only the time of a breakfast, not a whole day, nor days. After this Keliimalolo, with his wife and his sisters dwelt up in Keolewa, a place in Kohala adjoining the hill of Puuhue."
"Ia Keliimalolo e noho ana ilaila, a mahope, iho me ka wahine a me kona kaikuahine i kai o Koaie i ka lawaia, hooluuluu hinalea, a ahiahi napoo ka la, alaila, hoi i uka.

O ka loihi mai kahakai o Koaie a hiki i Keolewa, elima mile.","While Keliimalolo was residing there, he afterwards, together with his wife and a sister went down to Koaie to fish for hinalea. They were about ready to go home in the evening, but a shower was coming windward which frightened his wife and sister. He therefore grabbed hold of his sister in one hand and his wife in the other, and ran with great speed and entered their dwelling house at Keolewa. Then the rain fell. The distance from the beach at Koaie to Keolewa was five miles."
"He kanaka akamai loa o Kamoeau i ke kilokilo, a me ka olelo ana, a he kanaka ike i ke ano o ka leo o ke kanaka, o ka moa kani o ka po a me ke ao, o ka ie kuku a ka wahine, a me ka leo o na manu.",Kamoeau was an adept at guessing and at repartee; he knew the character of a man by his voice; a rooster by his crowing in the day or night; a woman by the ringing sound of her kapa block; and the birds by their singing.
"Ina e hele o Kamoeau ma ke alaloa, a lohe oia i ka ie kuku e kani ana, ina e kani winiwini ka ie, he wahine inoino, ina i kani papa, he wahine kina ma ke kino, ina i kani kolea mai ka ie, he wahine maikai.

Kamoeau never failed to characterize this or that woman by hearing alone, and not by sight. If a rooster crowed he could tell its color and shape according to its voice. If a black rooster, the voice was hollow and of sudden termination; if light-colored, the crowing was strong at the beginning and ended in broken accents; if dark red, the crowing at first was sharp and then became deep-toned; and if the rooster be mottled ( auha ), the voice would be harsh at the start and ended weakly."
"Ua hiki ia Kamoeau ke moe iloko o ka wai, mai ke kakahiaka a awakea, alaila, ala mai, nolaila, he mea kupanaha loa ia ma ka noonoo ana iho, a he ano akua wale no ka mana a me ka ike, ka pololei o ke koho ana, ina he oiaio keia alaila, mai ke ’kua mai no ia mea ia Kamoeau.","Kamoeau could lie under water from morning until noon, and then emerge therefrom. It is therefore a most extraordinary thing to think of, and the power and knowledge, the accuracy of the guessing, if it were true, was something supernatural, and was only transmitted by the deity to Kamoeau."
"No Hilo o Pahia, he kanaka hoopono me ka pololei loa oia, aole kekee a me ka lauwili, aole hooi a hoemi ihope elike me kekahi poe e ae.

[ ]","Pahia was a resident of Hilo, and was a righteous and very honest man; was not fraudulent and fickle; was not pompous nor recreant as other people. While residing in Hilo, or journeying to Kohala, if Pahia was entertained by a resident, or a friend, or a pretended wife, or brothers or parents, if the repast consisted of roasted pig, or a chicken, or turkey, or fish; or perhaps salt, or taro leaves, or roasted kukui, or perhaps limu and so forth, then Pahia would return the same. If a pig was roasted for his use, Pahia would make a remark thus: “ Aia no io wahi a Pahia ,” which meant, a pig was roasted for his use. Pahia would return the compliment to his entertainer when the latter came to his place; and if young taro leaves were given to Pahia to eat, Pahia would give his entertainer the same thing when the latter visited him. And if roasted kukui was given to Pahia, he would likewise compliment with the same ingredient, and in the same way in all other things. [ ]"
"Ua kaulana loa ia kanaka no ka mama i ka pii pali. Ua hiki ia ia ke pii ma ka pali nihinihi loa. No Molokai o Kawaaiki, o kana pali i pii ai o Molokai, o Pelekunu.

Aia hoi i ka welau o ka pali malalo iki iho, he kumu loulu ke ku ana ilaila, a oia ke kumu i pii ai o Kawaaiki i luna o ua pali la.","Kawaaiki was noted for his dexterity in cliff climbing. He could climb the most abrupt precipice. Kawaaiki was a resident of Molokai, and the cliffs that he climbed in Molokai were those at Pelekunu. These cliffs are very precipitous and very high, measuring about two hundred fathoms from the base to their crest. The top of the cliffs careened outwards, making a curve inwards at the base. Just a little below the summit of the cliffs, there stood a palm tree, and this was the object that allured Kawaaiki to climb that precipice."
"Ma keia pii ana a Kawaaiki, ua paapu o lalo o ke kai i na waa, no ka mea, ua pii pololei ka pali mai ke kai a luna loa. O kahi e paa ai o Kawaaiki i ka pali, o ka auwae, o na maiuu wawae me na maiuu lima, pela kona pii ana a hiki i ke kumu o ka loulu.

A pau ka loulu i ke oki, hoi maila ia i lalo nei.","During his ascent the sea below was covered with canoes, because the cliffs rose abruptly from the sea. Kawaaiki’s hold against the cliffs was made with his chin, his toe-nails and his finger-nails. In this way he ascended till he came to the trunk of the palm tree. Near by where the palm tree was growing was a cave, and in it was the home of a demi-god of olden days, which was Koloea by name. When Kawaaiki reached the mouth of the cave, he held on to it with his chin, his body and limbs hanging down. He then seized hold of the trunk of the palm tree and climbed up. As he landed, in the mau sphere perhaps, he observed that Koloea had the body of a bird with a human head. He took hold of the palm tree, cut it and threw it down. After cutting the palm tree he descended."
"Ua kaulana loa o Kaohele i ke koa a me ka mama loa i ka holo ana, aohe ona lua elike ai. No Molokai o Kaohele, i ka wa e noho ana o Kahekili he ’lii no Maui, holo maila ia e kaua ia Molokai.

He belonged to Molokai. During the reign of Kahekili as king of Maui, he (Kahekili) came to make war upon Molokai. In this war the king and people of Molokai were defeated, therefore certain warriors pursued Kaohele, and if caught were to kill him. While they were pursuing him, he showed wonderful speed, running and jumping, running and jumping. Therefore the pursuers were stationed in relays. As for instance: one at Honolulu, one at Kulaokahua, and one at Waikiki. If the first pursuer chasing after Kaohele did not catch him, then the next would continue the pursuit, and so on; hence the utterance: “Combine the speed in order to catch Kaohele.”"
"Ma keia holo ana a Kaohele imua o ka poe kukini e hahai ana, hiki aku la ia ma kekahi wahi pali o Niheu, Kawa kona inoa, aia no ma Molokai a hiki i keia la. Aia malaila he kawa auau no ka lehulehu, a he akea loa ka honua olalo, a he kiekie no hoi ke nana aku. Ua piha olalo i na koa o Maui a me na ’lii e noho ana me ka pololu a me ka ihe e makaukau ana e pepehi ia Kaohele.","While thus running before his pursuers, he came to a certain Niheu cliff called Kawa, which is in Molokai to this day. There was at this place a bathing pool for the people. The ground below was very wide, and the cliffs quite lofty by casual observation. Below were crowded the warriors and chiefs from Maui, armed with lances and spears, ready to kill Kaohele."
"A hiki o Kaohele malaila, ua lele oia me ka mama loa maluna o kela kapa a kau ma keia kapa, a holo aku la me ka launa ole aku o ka poe e hahai aku ana mahope.

Nolaila, ua kaulana loa o Kaohele ma kela wahi, keia wahi o neia mau mokupuni mai Hawaii a Niihau i ka mama a me ke koa. [ ]","When Kaohele arrived at this place he made a great leap from one bank to the other, and escaped, without the pursuers ever coming near to him. Many of the older people saw the place where Kaohele made the leap, and they asserted that the distance from bank to bank was thirty-six feet. Therefore Kaohele was quite famous in this and that place throughout these Islands from Hawaii to Niihau, on account of his speed in running and his bravery. [ ]"
"I ka wa e noho ana o Kahekili he ’lii no Maui, a o Kahahana he ’lii no Oahu nei iloko oia kau i holo mai ai o Kahahawai me na koa e kaua ia Oahu. Ma keia kaua ana ua hee a ua luku ia na kanaka Oahu, ma Niuhelewai, a ua hoi ka wai i uka o ka muliwai, no ka piha i na kanaka.","When Kahekili was reigning as king of Maui, and Kahahana was king of Oahu, it was during this period that Kahahawai with a number of warriors came to make war on Oahu. In this battle the people of Oahu were defeated and slaughtered at Niuhelewai, and the waters of the stream were turned back, the stream being dammed by the corpses of the men."
"A pau ke kaua ana ma Niuhelewai, hee aku nei na ’lii a me na koa a noho iluna o ke kuahiwi o Kaala. Ua makaukau loa lakou i na mea kaua, a me na mea e make ai ko lakou enemi, nolaila, noonoo ihola o Kahahawai i ko lakou mea e make ai, penei: He kanaha a oi ae ko lakou nui.

A makaukau keia mau mea, pii aku la lakou i ke ahiahi a luna o kekahi puu e kokoke ana i kahi a na enemi e noho ana, hoa aela lakou i na lamalama a lakou.","After the battle of Niuhelewai, the chiefs and the men retreated and encamped on the mountains of Kaala. They were well supplied with war implements and other things necessary for the destruction of their enemies. So Kahahawai contrived a means of destroying them, thus: They were a little more than forty men, and Kahahawai told them to prepare torches. When these were ready they went one evening to the top of a hill which was near to the rendezvous of the enemies where they lighted their torches."
"Ma keia a ana, holo aku la lakou a kekahi pali i kapa ia o Kolekole, pee ihola, a o ke ahi a no peia a hiki i ka pio ana, manao ihola na enemi ua pau i ka hiamoe o Kahahawai ma.

A o ka poe hoi i hahai i ke kukui, ua pio lakou aole wahi e pakele ai i ka make a me ka luku ia e Kahahawai ma.","After the torches were lit they moved away to a cliff called Kolekole and hid themselves there, leaving their torches burning at the former place until they (the torches) died out. The enemies thought that Kahahawai and his men had gone off to sleep. They therefore made a raid on the men of Kahahawai. But Kahahawai and his men arose and destroyed all the people who were asleep on the hills and the mountains of Kaala. Thus the enemies were annihilated, none escaping. Those who raided the torch encampment were captured, there being no avenue for escape from death and destruction by Kahahawai and his men."
"Nolaila, ua puni Oahu nei ia Kahekili, make o kona kanaka o Kahahawai, a me ka maalea loa i ka mea e make ai na enemi. Pela no ka lilo ana Oahu nei a hiki ia Kalaikupule ka Kahekili keiki, ia wa lilo ia Kamehameha.","Therefore, the conquest of Oahu by Kahekili was complete through the bravery and great ingeniousness of his warrior, Kahahawai, in devising means for the destruction of the enemy. Thus Oahu remained in subjugation until the reign of Kalaikupule, Kahekili’s son, when it was conquered by Kamehameha."
"He wahi kanaka aa uuku loa o Uma, ma kona kino ke nana aku, (elua kupika a me ka hapa kona kiekie). He akamai loa ia i ka lua, oia kekahi mea nui loa i ao ia ma Hawaii nei. I ka wa o Kamehameha akahi ke ’lii o Hawaii, he nui loa ka powa ana o na kanaka oia wa, ma na wahi mehameha, ma na awawa, a ma na ululaau loloa.","Uma was a daring and very small midget, looking at his person (about two cubits and a half in height). He was very skillful in the art of bone-breaking, one of the principal things taught in Hawaii. During the time of Kamehameha I, the king of Hawaii, there was much robbery amongst the people, in lonely places, in ravines and in forests of tall timbers."
"No Kohala o Uma, o Puehuehu kona aina i noho ai. Malaila aku kona hele ana a hiki i Puuhue, he puu noia e ku la ma ka hema o Kohala, he wahi paapu i na laau a me ka nahelehele.

From there he went to Puuhue, a hill which stands at the southern part of Kohala, a place thickly covered with woods and shrubbery. When Uma came to this place (he was carrying a piece of salt meat) and on entering the forest he found four men resting. Two were on the edge of the road, one toward the center, and one standing."
"Aloha aku la o Uma ia lakou, aole o lakou aloha mai, kaha aku la o Uma hele, lalau [ ] kekahi kanaka ia ia ma kona kua. Huli maila o Uma a hoolei i ka piko kaula, he iwilei ka loa (ekolu kapuai ka loa), a paa ihola hookahi kanaka, lele maila kekahi me ka oo hao a hou.

Uma faced about and threw the end of a rope (about three feet long), which encircled and held fast one of the men. Another man with an iron spade leaped forward to stab him. But Uma got hold of the first man he had caught, by the hair, and held him as a shield. This man was hit by the spade of the other man and killed. Another man leaped up to stab Uma with the iron spade but Uma dodged and caught him on the throat; that was his last moment. Three were killed and one ran away, thus escaping from Uma."
"Malaila aku o Uma a hiki i ka iho ana o Kapia ma Waimea e nana ala ia Mauna Kea kuahiwi, hele aku la o Uma i ke kahawai o Manauea e inu wai.

Lele hou o ka lua, e peku aku ana o Uma haule i loko o ka wai, pela ka noke ana, a pakele aku elua kanaka, no ka holo ana.","Thence he went on the way down to Kapia, at Waimea, looking toward Maunakea mountains, and continued on to Manauea stream to have a drink of water. While he was drinking, ten men appeared from down stream. When they came up to Uma, he saluted them, but they did not respond. He then arose and turned to go when one of the men sprang forward to seize him, but he slipped from under the man and caught the man by the throat, which made the man’s tongue hang out. Another man also sprang forward, but he got a kick from Uma that sent him into the water. Thus Uma dealt with the men, save two, who escaped by running away."
"Hele aku la o Uma a hiki ma Mahiki, mawaena o Waimea a me Hamakua, loaa he elemakule e noho ana i ke alanui, i ke oioina o Puuomoeawa.

He saluted Uma, and Uma did the same to him. He then took a smoke from his pipe, handing it to Uma after an interval. And while Uma was smoking the old man pushed the back of the pipe, but it did not go down because Uma was on the look-out, and therefore did not receive the misfortune intended for him. Uma, however, had in a loop of his girdle some salt which he threw in the eyes of the old man. And while he was rubbing his eyes which were burning Uma threw the pikoi at end of a three-foot cord, which encircled and held the man fast, and his limbs were broken in pieces. Uma then went on his way."
"Ma keia hele ana o Uma a hala o Hamakua, a luna o Hilo, a hiki oia ma Kaupakuea, mahope mai olaila, he awawa neneleau.

When Uma arrived at that place, he found a great big man sitting in the stream. Uma saluted him, but the other did not make any answer. In this meeting Uma came near losing his life by that man, because of the man’s great size and his proficiency in the art of bone-breaking. It was when Uma was about to turn and go on his way that the man jumped on his back and grabbed his neck, swinging Uma up. Therefore Uma slipped down and behind the man’s leg. He got hold of the man’s testicles and tore them from the body, and the man was killed. Thus Uma escaped."
"Oia kekahi koa kaulana o Kauai, ia ia e noho ana ma kona aina hanau, o Waiakalua ma Koolau o Kauai.

That was the time that Kaumualii was reigning as king of Kauai. Napuelua was taught to be a warrior and also all the acts in olden [ ] times relating to battle, such as spear-dodging, slinging, bone-breaking and all other things."
"A hala o Kaumualii i ka make, noho iho o Humehume ma ka noho aupuni o Kauai. Ia wa kaua o Humehume me Kahalaia.

At that time a battle was fought between Humehume and Kahalaia. In this battle Kauai was defeated, and many people were taken prisoners by the Hawaii people. And Kahalaia made a decree over the whole of Kauai, thus: If a man was black-skinned from the feet to the thighs, he was considered completely black, and should be killed. Not one of them was to escape. Thus was the decree on any and every one found with the mark."
"I ka wa i lilo ai ka papu o Waimea ia Hawaii, ia wa, hele na Hawaii a pau loa e imi i na pio o Kauai, e luku a e pepehi.

And when they arrived at Waiakalua, Napuelua was hiding in a woman’s sacred house. The searchers entered the house and found Napuelua, and looking on him saw that he was black. Then the soldiers were mustered up in five rows with muskets, to shoot Napuelua. Just then Napuelua stood up watching his chance. The guns were pointed and fired at him. He, however, fearlessly ran forward and seized the guns which were being fired at him. He got four guns, and after that the soldiers’ ranks were broken; and in the confusion Napuelua escaped, thereby deriving his name, the two guns."
"Ua kaulana loa ia ma Hawaii a puni, no kona ikaika loa a me ka mana.

That was the origin of the lines, “Only one Hawae but Kona is desolated.” Here is the meaning: An expert in the art of killing by prayer, which is the death prayer of the Hawaiian to this day. When he was residing in Kona, not one man on his land escaped death, and he never let one pass before his face. He was so very sacred. The lauhue was the only thing that grew about his place, and the chickens and the pigs and the dogs were his regular companions."
"Ua kaulana ia no kona ikaika i ke amo ana i ka lauhala no kona hale iluna o ka pali o Kupehau mawaena o Honokane a me Pololu, ma Kohala i Hawaii, hookahi ana haawe lauhala, ua paa elua hale nui loa, hookahi hale moe hookahi halau kau waa.

With one load of lauhala two large houses were enclosed, one a dwelling, the other a canoe shed. On this load that he was carrying were his wife and child. The reason for this method was because the precipice, Kohewaawaa by name, projected into the sea, the waves coming up and breaking against it then subsiding. As Kahauolopua was going along with his load the waves dashed over him, then he would brace himself against them by thrusting his staff against the precipice, then went on when the waves receded."
"Ia Kahauolopua e haawe ana, a popoi ka nalu maluna ona, alaila, koo aku la ia i ka laau i ka pali, a emi aku la ka nalu hele aku la. Ma keia hele ana no hoi, ua kaumaha loa kana haawe lauhala no ka pulu i ka nalu a me ke komo i loko o ke kai, aka, he mea ole ia i kona ikaika nui loa. A o kahi ana i amo ai i ka lauhala, ua aneane ekolu mile ka loa, aka, he inoino loa a he pali, a me ka hulaana kai. Nolaila, ua kaulana ia kanaka a hiki i keia la ma Kohala a puni.","While walking thus the load was made heavier by being wet through his wading in the sea, but it was nothing compared to his great strength. And the distance that he carried his load of lauhala was nearly three miles in length, and very bad and precipitous, not mentioning the dancing waves; and for this feat he became noted throughout Kohala until this day.

"He Puu nui keia; aia keia puu ma Hana, Maui nei; ka mea i kapaia ai ka inoa o keia puu Ka iwi o Pele, no ka hele ana mai o kekahi kanaka, o Namakaeha kona inoa, mai Kahiki mai keia kanaka i hele mai ai, a halawai me Mahinahina, a i kona halawai ana me Mahinahina, pane aku o Namakaeha iaia, nokamea, he wahine maikai ia, o kana kane oia o Kapapauoa ua kokoke no ia ma Puuhele, ma Hana o Maui nei, oia ka mea i olelo ia e ka poe haku mele, “O ka nalu hee o Puuhele,” a pela ’ku.","This is a prominent hill situated at Hana, Maui. It is named Ka-iwi-o-Pele, on account of a man named Namakaeha, who came from Kahiki and met Mahinahina. On meeting her, Namakaeha spoke to her because she was a good-looking woman. Her husband was Kapapauoa who lived near Puuhele, Hana, Maui, the place referred to by the bards as “The surf of Puuhele that is ridden.”"
"Ninau aku o Namakaeha ia Mahinahina: “E aho eu haele kaua ma nei wahi aku, o oe hoi ke kamaaina o neia wahi au e noho nei.” Pane mai o Mahinahina: “E ae aku ana au i kau koi mai, eia ka mea hewa, o ko kaua hui pu ana, no ka mea he kane oe no ka aina-e, a owau nei he wahine au no keia wahi a he kamaaina no hoi no keia wahi, malia paha o kii mai oe ia’u i wahine nau.” Pane mai o Namakaeha ia Mahinahina: “Aole o’u makemake e hana ia mea mawaena o kaua, no ka mea, he wahine no auanei ka’u, aia no i Kahiki, a no ka nui o kuu makemake e hele i ka makaikai, nolaila au i hele mai nei; he hele loa ae nei no ma ke alaloa, o ka ike ana mai nei ia oe nolaila, kipa mai nei maanei a loaa oe.”","Namakaeha said to Mahinahina: “Supposing we go along together from here, for you are familiar with this place where you are living.” Mahinahina answered: “I would consent to your proposal, but here is the trouble of our meeting; you are a man from a strange country, and I am a woman of this place, also a resident of it; you may want to get me for your wife.” Namakaeha replied to Mahinahina: “I do not desire such between us, because I have a wife still at Kahiki; but because of my great desire to go traveling, that is why I have come; I would have passed right on by the main road, only happening to see you, I came here and met you.”"
"Ae mai la o Mahinahina i ka ianei olelo, o ko laua nei hele aku la no ia a halawai me Kanahaha. Olelo mai o Mahinahina: “Aia kela wahine maikai la, no ka ike ana ia Puuhele make ai oia.

Mahinahina said: “There is another good-looking woman; but because she discovered Puuhele, she died. That is her spirit sitting there; she, however, is the oldest woman resident of this place.” They continued on until the woman spied them, when she called out: “The stranger and the kamaaina arrive. It is unfortunate that you do not find me in the flesh; this is a spirit body which exists; my way of living is not right, for I am only a spirit as you see; because I was much ashamed of Puuhele, therefore, I died.” Namakaeha quickly spoke to Mahinahina: “Let us proceed.” They kept on their way until they were seen by Lehoula, who came along to a little hillock; and while Lehoula was waving to them, the spirit woman chanted as follows:"
"Hiki mai hiki mai e ka la—e, O ka imi ana o ka ikaika la, A loaa ka lau o ka hau i ka makani, E-i mai ana paha ia’u i hoa nona-a, O keia imi ia e ka ikaika, a pela aku.","You have arrived this day, Looking round for an opponent Where the wind swirls the leaves of the hau , Perhaps calling to me to be friendly, This is what you are searching for, ye stalwart! etc."
"A pau ka ua wahine nei mele ana, kakali iho la o Namakaeha a hoopuka aku i kana mele penei:","When she had finished chanting, Namakaeha waited a little and then sang as follows:"
"Aole au i hele mai ma ke ano ikaika I hele mai au ma ka makaikai [ ] Ina he makemake no ka ikaika E hele no ma ia aoao. Aloha ka leo o ka ulili i ka-i mai-e, ua make oe, a pela aku.","I have not come to test strength; I have come as a traveler; [ ] If it is strength you desire, Pass by on that side. It would be a pity to hear the ulili saying, “you are dead,” etc."
"Apau kai nei mele ana, o ka i mai no ia o ua Lehoula nei me ka olelo iho: “He huakai aha kau o ka hele ana mai nei o nei?” Olelo aku keia: “He huakai makaikai ka’u i hele mai nei, a ike mai nei nae ia oe, nolaila, hele loa mai nei maanei. ” Olelo aku o Namakaeha ia Lehoula: “E aho e hele kaua i ka makaikai,” o koi ala ae mai la no ia, o ko laua hele aku la no ia e makaikai i ua puu nei.

Penei ka pule ana aku o ua Namakaeha nei, o keia pule nae ua maa mau ia Pele:","When he had finished chanting, Lehoula spoke up and asked: “What is the object of your travel to this place?” He replied: “I am traveling to see the country, and when I saw you, I came right over here.” Namakaeha said to Lehoula: “Suppose we go traveling together.” She consented, and they went together to view the hill. But Lehoula said: “On our way, if Pele should see us first, she wins, but if we should spy her first, we win.” So they went along, and Namakaeha caught sight of her first and he said to Lehoula: “There is the woman”, and he commenced to chant. Thus did Namakaeha pray, a chant however customarily used for Pele:"
"Kani kahoa kaluna kiei opua, Haule ka inaina hookahi, ka ua. Ka ua i ku kaua i lani nei, Ke ahalani kuku ka ua maaweau, a pela aku.","An exhorting cry reaching up to high heaven, To drop the one thing abhorred, the rain. The rain from the east, from yon high heaven; From heaven the rain falls quickly in a narrow stream, etc."
"Apau kai nei pule ana, o ko Pele ea ae la no ia mai ke kilo uala ana. A pane mai ia Namakaeha, ike e mai la nae ia Lehoula e moe ana ilalo e kiei mai ana, ike aku ua Pele nei a kau aku i kana pule:","After his prayer, Pele looked up from where she was digging potatoes and spoke to Namakaeha. She also saw Lehoula lying down and peeping, so Pele chanted as follows:"
"He wahine auhea ke ku hanai mai nei, I na la ilalo ke alo, mai pepehia mai holeholehia, Oi ka ia i ka makau la i malu, I na lili oe e malu ai, i kaula oe e malu ai, a pela aku.","Notice the woman skimming along the ground, Facing downward; came near dying, being stripped off. Rid her of fear for safety, Of jealousy for safety. By the prophet art thou saved!"
"Pane mai ua Pele nei: “He huakai aha ka huakai?” “He huakai makaikai,” wahi a Namakaeha, “ame ka imi ikaika no hoi kekahi.” Pane mai o Pele: “Kai no he huakai no ka pono, eia ka he huakai no ka ino.” Ia manawa no a laua nei e kamailio ana, o ka nalo aku la no ia o Lehoula, a hoi aku la no i kona wahi.

Pele said: “I had thought it was a journey for a good purpose, but it is a journey with an evil design.” While they were talking Lehoula disappeared, and went back to her place. These two fought until Pele was weakened. The body of Pele was then taken and the bones were stripped of flesh and taken and buried in the ground. They were exhumed by dogs, placed in a pile and that was why this hill was so named, because the bones of Pele were stripped off there. Perhaps others have a different explanation, but this is what I have obtained by questioning friends concerning this subject. This hill stands on the east side of Maui, near Hana."

On the eastern side of the same hill are the holes made by the club of Kane and Kanaloa. On the western side were the boys digging potatoes; near that is the fishing Noio (small black bird). These are the famous places on this hill. Perhaps there are other famous places on this hill; you will supply them.

Namakaeha was killed by Wakiu. Wakiu, however, had used his numerous bodies, and that was how he won; had he used his single body like the other, he would not have been safe from the champion of Kahiki. That is the story of this hill. John Moo."
"Aia i ke au i kunewa aku la, ma ia wa i hoomana ia ai ke akua oopu. Ke kumu o keia hana ana pela, i mea e nui ai na oopu; ina aole e hoomana ia, momona ole na oopu, a nunui ole no hoi.

This was done to increase the oopus. If the god was not worshiped, the oopus would be neither fat nor numerous. This god was called Holu. This name was derived on account of the keeper going to the beach to fish and catching soft-shell crab ( aama which had shed its shell and was consequently soft); that was why it was called Holu. Before that there was no name. The keepers were Kalana and Waihauakala, and from them were born two children, Ahakeanui , a daughter, and Kaneikakalua, a son."
"Aia i ka wa i make ai na makua, ua noho iho na keiki me ka malama no ia Holu. Ua pii mai no hoi na kanaka e hoomana. Eia na mea e lawe ai; puaa hiwa, moa lawa, puawa hiwa, niu hiwa, ia ula.

The people continued also to come up to worship. Here were the things brought: a black pig, a white chicken, root of the black awa, dark coconut, and red fish. It was taken and placed on a prepared stone platform. Then was lighted the imu for the pig, the imu for the chicken and the fish, and the awa chewed, the awa to be drunk by the god. A child who had never cohabited was selected; when everything was ready, the god’s [offering] was given first, and after that the people’s."
"Ekolu nuu o keia wahi, nuu mua no na wahine ame na kaikamahine, nuu alua no na kane ame na keiki kane, nuu akolu no na kahuna.

Pau ia noa ae la, kii ka oopu, ua hele a kohu Opule moe one ka nui, ai aku, momona.","This place had three platforms; the first platform for the women and girls, the second platform for the men and boys, and the third platform for the priests. Prayers for blessings on this life were offered; after that the cup of awa was taken and given to this god to drink; he appeared just like a man, but was in reality a network, and was wrapped in a wicker basket with the exception of the head and the mouth. After that everything was free; the oopu was obtained; it was then like the sand-sleeping opule ; when it was eaten it was delicious."
"Hoi aku la na kanaka me ka olioli, no ka ai ana o Holu i ka mohai, pau ae la, aole e huhu mai a momona ole na oopu. Hoomaka na kanaka e hana i ka ha, he laauliilii me he aho hale la ke ano, ua hana ia a pili me he hauna ako hale la, me kaula e paa ai, he ie ke kaula pono.

[ ]","The people would return rejoicing that Holu had partaken of the sacrifice, for when that was finished [the god] would not sulk and render the oopus lean. The people next began the construction of a ha ; these were small sticks similar to house battens, which were set close together, but without the covering of sugar-cane leaves; tied down with cords of i-e , which was the proper vine for cords. The ha was built along one side of the stream, walled in well by rocks; and any kind of wood was used. But it must be wood which was known to be durable. The posts and the sills were important timbers, more so than the battens [which may be of any kind of wood]; the side in the water was braced with wooden posts. [ ]"
"No ka paa ana o ka ha kalua ka puaa, mama ka awa, a makaukau, pule aku ia Holu. Penei ka pule ana:","When the ha was completed, a pig was killed, the awa was chewed, and when everything was ready, a prayer was offered to Holu in this manner:"
"“E Holu, e hooko mai oe i ka makemake o kau poe pulapula kukulu ha, e haawi mai i ka oopu ai lehua o Hoopulu; E hoolohe mai oe e ke alii o Hoopulu. Hoi mai e inu, e ai. Amama.”","“O Holu, grant the desire of your ha-constructing devotees; give them the lehua-fed oopus of Hoopulu. Harken, thou chief of Hoopulu. Return to partake of the drink and the food. Amen.”"
"Ai no hoi apau, kii ka wai hoohuli mai ma kahi o ka ha e ku nei, papani a paa olalo, pii mai ka wai maluna o ka ha. O ka waiwai o keia, no ka wa wai nui wale no; alaila lilo mai ka oopu, kau maluna o ka ha, me ke kaupale ia ma o a maanei noho aku ka mea nona ka ha, a loaa ka oopu mua a hoolei aku i kahi e, no ka mea he mea mau ia, ina aole e hoolei ia e lilo ana ka mea i hanaia i wahi holo na ka wai, mai mua ai hope; pono ole ai.","After eating, the water was diverted, so that it would flow towards the ha, by banking up the head so that the water would rise and flow over the ha. The value of this was only for the time of a freshet, when the oopus were taken by the water and stranded on the ha where it was protected by the bank on either side. The owner of the ha waited until the first fish was caught which fish was thrown aside, for that was the custom; for if it were not cast aside, that which had been prepared would become useless, for it would be torn by the water from the head to the rear and become good for nothing."
"Aole pono i ka wahine kahe koko ke pii iluna o ka ha, no ka mea he hookae o Holu i na wahine kahe koko. Aole no e pono ke auau mamua o ke poo o ka ha. Aole e pono ke hele ke kanaka maluna o ka ha, a wahine, a keiki paha, ina ua hele e uwe i ka mea ua make, a kanu pu paha. Eia ka pono, e pikai kaiolena; he olena me ka wai ame ka paakai, alaila pi aku i ka maka o na mea i haumia, na ka mea nana ka ha e hana i keia mea.","It was kapu for a woman having her menses to climb or walk on the ha, because a woman in that condition was despised by Holu. It was kapu to bathe at the head of the ha. It was kapu for a man, woman or child who had been to a house of mourning to walk on the ha. He or she should do this first: purify with olena-salt water—olena and water and salt mixed together—by throwing the same on the eyes of the unclean. The owner of the ha performed this service."
"Aole e pono ke pani ma kahi haiki o kahawai, aia wale no ma kahi e mana ai o ka wai ma kela ame keia aoao, alaila pono pani ma kahi aoao, huli ka wai ma kahi aoao. Pani a pio huli ia ka oopu.

Then in that case the head of one branch was dammed up and all the water was diverted into the other. After the head was dammed up, and that side was dry, then was the time to look for oopus. If one had an apua that was placed where there was plenty of water so that when the oopus were being swept along, they would be caught in this. The apua was a basket braided like the traps used in catching fish in the sea; small at the bottom and large at the mouth like that of a bell; and was braided in the form of a funnel."
"Aole pono e pii ae ka wahine a keiki, a kanaka paha, maluna o ka ahua, aole nohoi e hele mamua, aole ma ke hoomalumalu maluna, aole ma ke hoohala mai i ka wai mahope o ka apua.

Keia mau kapu apau no Holu wale no.","It was kapu for a woman, child, or a man to sit on a knoll, or walk at the head [of this place] or to cause a shadow to fall [on this place] or to make a noise with or in the water behind the apua. It was not well to cook the nuukole (the red-tail mudfish) and pound it until pulverized, and then throw it into the water. If that were done, a freshet would come and break down the head of the dammed up division. All these kapus belonged to Holu."

Papa Jr.","That was how the people of Honokohau observed this kapu until the days of [ ] Haumalaue, the oopu god of Makamakaole, who fought with and was killed by Kaneikapalua with the aid of Holu. It was he who urged Kaneikapalua to cast his spear and strike the gill; and thus he [Haumalaue] died. At the same time the earthly body of Waihauakala became a large koa tree which stands even to this day, a place for recuperating from the effects of an illness. Kalana’s soul, however, went and lived at the source of the water, and became a large koa tree for the pali of Kalana. Ahakeanui was carried by the water to the shore of Kunounou. After a while Holu wanted some awa, so he changed from his stone body and went for some; after he obtained it, he still lacked water. So he stretched out his legs and with one foot on one side of the precipice and the other on another side, he trod down and water came forth. Those springs were named Waipu and Kaluaokapuhi. Holu was carried by the water to the sea; he tore off a part of his body, and that became the sea oopu, known as poopaa . At this time there are no more restrictions on any of these things; the people no longer go up to worship. No attention whatever is paid to them. Lemuel K. N. Papa Jr."

The subject of this story is between Kahoolawe and Makena, Maui, in a southeasterly direction from Lahaina. But what is wanted is to find out the cause of its origin. I have two important matters to present concerning the origin of this islet: 1. Relating to its having been born by parents; 2. Its originating from Haupu, that mountain on Molokai."

This daughter of theirs was placed on Kahoolawe; the name of Kahoolawe at that time, however, was Kohemalamalama; it was a very sacred land at that time, no chiefs or common people went there."

Hua lived along until he desired to get some ua’u squabs to eat; then he sent some men up to the mountains above Oloalu to get some squabs to satisfy his desire. He did not wish for birds from the beach. When the birds were obtained, they were to be taken to the priest for him to ascertain where the birds came from; if he should give out the same information as the men had given to the chief as to the source of the birds, then he would be safe; if he should give a contrary answer, he would be killed. The name of this priest was Luahoomoe, and [ ] he also had children. When the men went up, they could not find any mountain birds at all, so they decided to get some shore birds. When they caught some, they daubed the feathers red with dirt so that the chief would think the birds came from the mountain. When they returned and handed the birds to the chief, he was exceedingly glad because he thought the birds came from the mountain. The chief told the men to take them to the priest for his inspection. The priest perceived, however, that the birds came from the seashore, so he told the chief that they did not come from the mountain, but from the seashore. Then the chief said to the priest: “You shall not live, for you have guessed wrongly. I can very well see that these are mountain birds.” Then and there an imu was prepared in which to bake the priest."
"Mamua nae o kona hookomo ia ana iloko o ka imu, olelo aku ia i kana mau keiki: “I noho olua a i a ka imu, a i pii auanei ka uahi a moe i uka o Olowalu, o ke ala no ia hele ana, a ina e pii ka uahi a paa i kahi hookahi, o ko olua wahi no ia e noho ai, alaila, mai manao ae i wahine-e ka olua, aia ka olua wahine o ke kaikamahine a Puuhele ma, o ka wahine ia, pono ka noho ana, ola no hoi na iwi.

O ka uahi hoi e kau nei iluna o Hanaula, ua lilo ae la i ao, a haule iho la no ka ua ma ia wahi; he mahiai ka hana a ua mau keiki nei, i ai na ka wahine na Puuoinaina.","Before he was placed in the imu, however, he said to his children: “You two wait until the imu is lighted, and when the smoke ascends, should it break for the Oloalu mountains, that indicates the path; move along; and where the smoke becomes stationary, that indicates where you are to reside. Also, do not think of any other woman for a wife; let the daughter of Puuhele and his wife be your wife. With that wife you will live well, and your bones be cared for. ” Then the priest was cast into the oven and the opening closed up tightly. The smoke arose and darkened the sky; for six days did the smoke darken the sky before the fire in the imu gave out. But after the priest had been in the imu for two days, he reappeared and sat by the edge of the imu unknown to any one; the chief thinking all the time that he was dead; but it was not so. When the smoke ascended and leaned towards the Oloalu mountains, the two sons went off in that direction; the cloud pointed towards Hanaula, and there it stood still, so the two sons ascended to the place and resided there. Then the whole of Maui became dry; no rain, not even a cloud in the sky, and people died from lack of water. The smoke that hung over Hanaula became a cloud, and rain fell there. The two men became planters so as to furnish their wife Puuoinaina with food."
"Noho iho la hoi ua ’lii nei, oia o Hua, a no ka make i ka wai, pololi no hoi, holo aku la ia i Hawaii i kahi o kona hanau mua, a no ka nele no hoi o Hawaii i ka wai ole a me ka pololi i ka ai, hoi mai la oia a ma Wailuku.

Wailuku also did not have any water, and that caused the chief to be crazed, so he leaned against the edge of the precipice and died, and that was the origin of the saying “The bones of Hua rattle in the sun.”"
"I ka noho ana hoi a ua mau keiki nei a oo ka ai a laua, kalua a mo-a, o ka lawe no ia na na makuahonowai a me ka wahine. O keia mau keiki nae, he mau manu laua, Kaakakai ka mua, o Kaanahua ka muli.

[ ]","These sons lived until their food was ripe, then they cooked it and carried it to their parents-in-law and their wife. These sons, however, were birds; Kaakakai was the elder and Kaanahua was the younger. A prophet living at Kauai noticed this smoke hanging right over Hanaula, so he sailed towards it with eight forties of pigs to be offered as a sacrifice to these sons, so that life might be restored to the whole of the Hawaiian Islands. [ ]"
"I ka hiki ana mai o ka makaula, e lele aku ana laua nei iluna o na makuahonowai, a hiki ka makaula ilaila, lele laua nei i Kahoolawe, a mai laila ae, hoi hou laua nei i Hanaula, a malaila, loaa i ka makaula, oia ka ka loaa o ka ua a hiki mai i keia wa.

Nokamea, ma ia hope mai, ua kii o Puuoinaina i ke kane a Pele, oia hoi o Lohiau, ua pau aku la ka manao i kela mau kane.","When the prophet arrived, these two flew on to the parents-in-law; when the prophet arrived there, they flew to Kahoolawe, and from there they returned to Hanaula, and at that place the prophet met them [and offered his sacrifice]; and that was how the rain was restored. While these sons lived at Hanaula, they thought a great deal of Puuoinaina, their wife, but they did not know what she was doing. Because after that Puuoinaina took for her the husband of Pele, Lohiau, and forgot her own husbands."
"Aka, i ka lohe ana o Pele i keia hana a Puuoinaina, lilo iho la ia i mea ino loa ia Pele. Ia wa oia i hoopuka aku ai i na olelo ino loa imua o Puuoinaina, a lohe ia i keia mau olelo ino a Pele, o ka hilahila no ia o ua o Puuoinaina a holo iloko o ke kai, haalele aku la i kona aina ia Kohemalamalama, o Kahoolawe hoi ka inoa i keia wa.

Oia iho la kahi moolelo no kona hanau ia ana mai e kona mau makua, a loaa’i keia inoa hou o Molokini.","But when Pele heard what Puuoinaina had done she became angry. She then cursed Puuoinaina. When Puuoinaina heard this cursing from Pele she felt so ashamed that she ran into the sea. She left her home, Kohemalamalama, now called Kahoolawe. Pele, residing at Kahikinui, thought so much of her husband, Lohiau, who was living at Kealia, Kamaalaea, that she started out to meet him; but she found her way blocked by Puuhele, so she went from there and waded through the sea. She saw her lizard rival, Puuoinaina, stretching from Kahoolawe to Makena, so she came along and cut the lizard in two, right in the middle, separating the tail from the head. The tail became Puuolai at Makena, and the head became Molokini. When the husbands heard that their wife was dead, they looked and beheld the head of their beloved standing in the sea, so they called the name of the islet Molokini. That is the story of how it was born of its parents and how it obtained this new name Molokini."
"O KONA LOAA ANA MAI MAILOKO MAI O HAUPU, KELA PUU MA MOLOKAI.","HOW IT WAS OBTAINED FROM HAUPU, THAT HILL ON MOLOKAI."
"Eia ke kumu o ke kaawale ana o Molokini mai Haupu mai.

It was during the battles of Kana with the chief of Haupu; the latter had taken his mother, and Kana wanted her released to return to her husband; the husband had felt very badly because his mate, the wife, was separated from him; he had cast about for a way of getting her back, but found none. So the father thought that Kana could bring her back, because he had numerous bodies, and he was born in a queer way. But when Kana went to get the mother, the hill started to grow upwards and nearly touched the heaven. This was the reason for it: there were two turtles under the mountain; so when Kana went over for his mother, the people on the mountain called to the turtle in this manner: “O Kahakauwila, lift up the hill;” then the mountain would rise until Kana became a dwarf alongside of it. This was continued until Kana was hungry, because his food had given out, so he laid down towards Uli, his grandmother, who was residing on Hawaii. She nourished him until he grew large. When his younger brother saw that Kana’s feet were plump he said to himself, “Strange! here you have enough to eat and I live in hunger; I shall cut off your feet.” So he cut off Kana’s feet. Kana said to his grandmother: “My feet are getting cold.” The grandmother replied: “Yes, your younger brother noticed that your feet were fat; he became peeved; and that was why he chopped them off.”"
"Ia wa, o ke ala mai la no ia o Kana, a hoomaka hou me kona enemi e kaua, a mahope iho, o ka pii ae la no ia o ua puu nei, mamuli o ke kahea ana a na kanaka, pii no ua puu nei pii pu no me Kana, o ka hele ia a haule ua puu nei malalo o Kana, oi ae la keia maluna, nana ae la hoi kanaka a ike i na maka o Kana i ka aa iho maluna, aole o kana mai ka makau a me ka weliweli.

Oia ka mea i loaa’i ke kumu o Molokini, he apana no Haupu kele i ke kai.","Then Kana arose and commenced the fight with his enemy again; the mountain started to rise because of the call from the people to do so. But when the mountain rose up, Kana also rose up. They went up together until the hill was lower than Kana. Kana tipped it, and when the people [on the hill] looked up and saw Kana’s eyes glaring down at them, they trembled with fear. Kana then trod the hill, and broke [ ] it into small pieces; some flew over towards Koolau, Oahu; some were thrown right near Molokai, and some flew over towards Maui. That was how Molokini was originated; it was a part of Haupu wet with the sea."

Kumuhonua took to wife Kauaohilo and begat Kaenaena; Kaenaena took Waiukeke of Kaliuwaa and begat Lihau. It was said that he excelled in comeliness any other handsome man of that time, and from him descended men of this group who were good to look upon. Lihau took to wife Kapulani and begat Ihiihi, the one whose name is—Pa’upa’u. Because the parents and servants [of Ihiihi] became wearied with constant going down to Kahala to get water with which to bathe the child, the parents complained and said: “There is too much labor connected with this work [ he pa’u keia hana ], and too little benefit. Therefore they named the place where their child lived Pa’upa’u."

He was the first one to build a heiau for the worship of a god called Moo. This lizard [god] excelled in strength; it had a stumped tail; that is the way the tails of the lizards of the present time appear, because of Moo, the great and strong."

Here is one of his famous remarks: “If we live together and I die, do not bury me down here at Lahaina; carry me to the top of Pa’upa’u and bury me there, because the white man is a seeker of land.” What he prophesied has come to pass."

That was probably the place to where Kahekili the great and his soldiers fled after his battles with Kamehameha, chief of Hawaii. In the battle fought below Kauaula where Kamehameha was victorious, they [Kahekili [ ] and his forces] ran to the place of refuge for safety; when the Hawaii forces commenced to climb, stones were rolled down on them; thus Kahekili escaped from the great spear of Kamehameha; thus the Maui forces escaped."

Why is it that the pupils of this school are not allowed to keep horses for themselves? Perhaps it is because they favor the white men; they can’t be Hawaiians, else they would recognize their own."

Pele was born at Hapakuela. It is said that this land touches the sky to the southwestward of us. She lived with her parents until she was married. She begat two children, Laka, a daughter, and Menehune, a son. Wahieloa was their father and husband to Pele. But while living together with her husband he was enticed and snatched away from her by Pelekumulani; and because she was deprived of her husband she was displeased. She came away because of the love of husband."

It is said that here in Hawaii in the earliest times there was no sea; the land was exposed. There was not even fresh water, but because she brought the sea it reached Hawaii. Because Pele was displeased on account of her husband being enticed from her, she came to Hawaii; her parents gave her the sea, so that when she came she could bring her canoes. She arrived at Pakuela, and from there she came to Kanaloa where she poured out the sea from her head, and there and then Hawaii first received the sea. When the sea broke [on the land] her brothers composed this chant:"

Passed is the quietness of the sea: It is breaking double, It is breaking triple. It is a sea carried on the back of Pele. The sea turned around and smote the earth. The sea is rising, rising to Kilauea, Raising up the hand of Pele. The sea of Pele is growing larger— The sea nestled on the breast of Pele. The voice of the sea is tumultuous at Papalauahi; The sea is rising to the height of Akanikolea; The sea is spreading to the ki at Wahinekapu. It is the sea of Pele the goddess! Thy compassion be on us!"

However, all the land was not covered, some places were still exposed, such as the summits of Haleakala, Maunaloa and Maunakea; these were not totally submerged. [ ] This sea was named after the mother of Pele, i.e., Kahinalii, because the sea belonged to her; Pele simply brought it, and caused it to recede to what it is which we see today, floating calmly at Hauola."

Pele, however, came first and her brothers followed. When the brothers arrived at Kanaloa, Pele had arrived at Kauai. It was there the brothers chanted another song:"
"Holo mai Pele a Kauai, Kau na waa i Mookini Ku o Pele ma i ike kii Noho i ke kai a Pele Kanaenae Pele ilaila Kai a huakai; kai mai Pele, A ka lae i Leleiwi, Honi i ke ala o ka hala, He lehua o Mokaulele, Kuula na lehua i Puuloa, Halauloa o Kilauea, Hale moe o Papalauahi, Haule mai Pele mai ka lani mai, Ka hekili o ke olai, Ka ua loku o ka ua poko, Hoihoi o Kaumeaiku, O na wahine i ke ao maukele, O mai Pele! e liu, e liu e! Eia makou koolau kaula la, Elieli, e kau mai!","Pele sailed for Kauai; Her canoes landed at Mookini. Pele and others stood before the image. Pele dwelt in the sea. Pele offered sacrifices there. Pele progressed with her retinue And at the cape of Leleiwi Scented the fragrance of the hala And the lehua-flowers of Makaulele, The lehua standing red at Puuloa. [Saw] the large house at Kilauea, The sleeping house at Papalauahi. Pele arrived from heaven [With] the thunder and the earthquake, The severe rain and the soft rain; Returned by Kaumeaiku, [By] the women of the land in the clouds. Answer thou, Pele! Prepare! Prepare! Here we are thy numerous ministers! Have compassion on us!"
"Aka, he mau kumu no keia haku ana i keia mau mele, no ka mea, aole i maopopo lea i na kaikunane kahi e noho paa loa ai o Pele ko laua kaikuahine eia ka auanei e noho paa aku ana i Kilauea, mamua ka loaa ana i ke mele a mahope ka noho ana’ku.","There were reasons for composing this song, because the brothers did not know for a certainty where Pele, their sister, would make her permanent abode, not knowing she would make it at Kilauea. They had composed the chant before she came to live there."
"Aka, ia Pele i noho ai ma Kauai, a haalele oia ia wahi, mailaila mai a noho ma Kalaupapa i Molokai, o Kauhako ka inoa oia wahi, a mailaila mai a noho ma Puulaina a nana i eli, haalele ia Puulaina, mailaila aku a noho ma Haleakala, a nana no i eli, a malaila aku, noho i Kilauea, a mahele i na wahi o lakou; he okoa ko Kamohoalii wahi a he okoa ko Kahuilaokalani, a ma ia manawa mai aole a iki ka Pele ma ko Kamohoalii wahi, no ka mea, he kino okoa kekahi ona, he anuenue, he kapu loa kona mahele aina, aole e a ia, a oia iko la ka hope o keia. Aole no i loaa nui mai na mea e pili ana i ke Kaiakahinalii. O na mea wale no keia i loaa i ka mea nana i hai mai ia’u. Moanauli. [ ]","Pele lived at Kauai, and when she left that place she came and lived at Kalaupapa, Molokai, at a place called Kauhako; from there she came and lived at Puulaina; she dug there; leaving Puulaina, she went to live at Haleakala; she also dug there. From there she went to Kilauea. There she caused a separation of their residences. Kamohoalii was assigned one place, and Kahuilaokalani was given a different place. From that time forth Pele was never seen at Kamohoalii’s place, because she had another body, the rainbow; her division of land is very sacred, and no fire was kindled there. This is the end of the story. There was not very much given concerning the Flood. That was all that the one who told me knew. [ Moanauli. ] [ ]"

They went to a place right above Kaanapali, called Wahikuli. They went up from Lahaina. Arriving there they cut the battens that whole day. That night, however, was showery and it was cold, so they talked about going back because it was night. The husband insisted on sleeping up in the mountains, and it was so decided. Before they went to sleep, however, they went and gathered a lot of wood which they placed all around the cave. That cave is still at that place today."

While sleeping and nearing midnight, the brother of the wife awoke startled, on account of the great heat; when he awoke he found that the fire had commenced to burn his feet, and that was really the reason for his awakening; but the brother-in-law still slept. The fire, however, had commenced to consume his feet; so he tried to awaken him, but without any success; the fire burned up to the knee, and he was still trying to awaken the brother-in-law; he kept this up until his stomach, his breast and his shoulders were consumed. When the fire reached the neck he ran away. He climbed a hill and when near the top he heard the head calling: “Let us not go home now; wait until I arrive, then we will go home together.” But he kept on running; the head meanwhile kept on calling from behind. He passed one hill and while descending the second hill, the head commenced to roll after him. At the same time he saw tongues of fire shooting out from the rolling head. It called again, “O Head! O Head! retard him so that I can catch him.” They thus raced along until a number of valleys had been passed; and when they reached the plains above Puulaina he realized that the head was close behind him, so he did not go by way of Puulaina but made a short cut for the sea by the trail heading for Keonepoko , on the western side of Mala. At the same time, a prophet who was going to Kaanapali with some friends saw this person running along, so he said to his friends: “If this person running towards us is not caught by that head until he comes up to us, he will be saved; but if he be caught above here he would be fortunate if he lives.”"

The prophet replied: “Let us wait; if we go on that man would die.” He directed them to split the bambu into small pieces. It was done at once. When the man arrived before them, the head was right at his heels; he fainted away. The others lashed the head with the split bambu and it died; the brother was still in a dead faint. After a while, however, he came to and told them of their journey, and how this trouble came to him. After that the others continued their journey, while he went home. Arriving at the house his sister asked: “Where is your brother-in-law?” He replied: “You question as if it were correct. Your husband is no good. I thought he was man; I found him a god. He came near killing me.” The other asked: “Kill you, how?” So he told what happened from the time they went until they came by this trouble. The sister approved of what had been done, saying: “It is well he died! I see that he is a god.” [ ]"

He had gone on until an idea occurred to him to return, because he realized that if he did not come back then all these people would be eaten by this god; for the head was not dead; its spirit still lived. And when he came to where these two were talking he said: “I have returned because I feared you would all be consumed. Your husband is coming, but it will be when nearing night; you will then behold your husband coming to you in the same way he usually appeared. So, do not stay here; all of you go to your brother’s house, and we will wait there. When he arrives then all of you surround me so that he can not see me; do you not, however, acquiesce in his request to come back and live with him, because if you do you will surely die.”"

The prophet, however, chased it. That is what I have learned."
"I ka manawa i hoohui ia ai kela wahine iloko o ka hale, a noho, olelo mua aku la nae ka makaula i ua wahine la: “Ina anu oe, e noho iloko o ka hale, alaila e hoolohe pono oe, ina i kani ka hokio mua, alaila, manao ae oe aole i kokoke mai, a alua hokio ana ua ane kokoke mai, a kani hou ka hokio ua kokoke loa, alaila, nee aku oe a maloko o kuono o ka hale, moe malie iho oe, a hiki mai kela, aole anei e nalo ka hiki mai, e malamalama ana mawaho nei, o kona hiki no ia.

When you hear the first whistle, then you will think that it is not near; at the second whistle, he has drawn nigh, and when the whistle sounds again, he is very near; then you move further in to the corner of the house, lie down and keep still and wait for his arrival. You will not fail to notice his coming; when the outside here is lighted up, he has appeared. When he arrives he will not enter the house; his hands will be groping inside while his head will remain outside watching other people; but when the inside is lighted up, then he has entered the house; you will then hide yourself well so that he will be delayed in his search for you.”"

All kept awake, however, and at about midnight, they heard the sound of a whistle, and they knew that he would soon appear; when the whistle sounded again the prophet ran over to the house where the woman was and said to her: “Should your head of a husband ask you to give him your son to rear, do not consent; and should he ask you to come outside do not go outside, else you die.” The real reason for his coming up, however, was to find out whether or not she was asleep; but when he called, she answered. So the prophet returned to the house from which he came. Arrived there, he heard another whistle, and still another, and after that the head arrived at the house and called out to the wife, “O Kaneikiawaiuli!” The other answered. The head said: “Please come out here.” Kaneikiawaiuli replied: “I will not come out.” “Why not?” asked the head. “It is raining for Kaala is shiny.” “There is no rain,” answered the head."
"Olelo hou mai no ua poo nei: “Haawi mai hoi ha oe i kekahi keiki a kaua na’u e hanai aku i ka ai, eia hoi ka puni a ke keiki a kaua la, o ka maia, ua hele a kapule.” “Aole au e haawi aku.” Pela no a hala kekahi mau minute, hoomaka mai la oia e haha maloko, aole nae kela i loaa aku, a komo iho la kela poo iloko o ka hale, o ka manawa no ia i holo mai ai o ka makaula me na kanaka a puni ma ka puka, a holo mai la ka wahine a puka iwaho, a pani ia aku la ka puka a paa, a kahea mai la kela poo maloko: “E, mai pani hoi paha oukou i ka puka ia’u i puka aku au iwaho.” Aole nae he hookuu ia aku o ka puka, a puhiia aku la ka hale i ke ahi.

D. Kamaha.","Again the head spoke: “Then please let me have one of our children and I will give it food; I have that which is greatly desired by our child, the banana; it is well ripened.” “I will not give you one.” It went on thus for a few minutes, when he rushed in and felt around, but the woman was not found; the head finally got into the house; it was then the prophet and others ran and blocked the doorway, and the woman ran and got outside. The door was closed. The head called from inside: “Say, please do not close the door on me; I wish to come outside.” But the door was not opened, and the house was set on fire. The other kept calling from the inside. It kept [ ] on in this manner until the house was surrounded by fire, and the head of this god burst; after twelve reports [were heard] the prophet then said that [the head] was dead. This is the end of what I know, but perhaps there is more to the story. D. Kamaha."

There were two potato fields, one for Kupihe and the other for Kapanaia. Kupihe planted his potato on the side hill while Kapanaia planted his on the flat. When they were cultivating, only one potato was found in Kapanaia’s field, so he hilled it up. But the potato grew large and became exposed from the hill in which it was planted; the field of the other man, however, did not contain any potato. Afterwards they went to their homes, and on the next day they went up again to cultivate. Kapanaia hastened to see [his potato], but when he looked there was no lump in the hill; he searched but could not find the potato. He looked here and there, but he could not find it. So he went up to Kupihe’s, the field on the hillside. When he looked, he saw this potato causing a lump in the other’s potato hill, and Kupihe was hilling up the soil. Kapanaia stood there and asked, “Whose potato is this?” The other answered: “It is mine, for it is growing in my potato-hill.” After their quarrel over the potato they returned to their homes. That night the potato rolled down the hill and made a deep hole where it first struck; from there it bounced and became again attached to its parent vine. That is one version of the story. But in the story which I heard, it is stated that the stem of this potato was bitten by a rat and the potato rolled down until it landed in Kapanaia’s field, and it was left there until new sprouts commenced to grow from it. That is why new sprouts come from potatoes as we see them now. That was why this potato at Makiki was called Ualakaa, because it rolled [down hill]. Another name which I heard [applied to it] was Iolekaa (rolling rat). Another has it that Kaauhelemoa pecked at the stem of this potato and it rolled to Kapanaia’s field, because Pupuulima chased after it."

Eeke was the husband and Lihau was the wife. They were real persons, but it will be shown later the reason for their being changed to mountains. [ ] After they had lived as man and wife, a child was born to them, a son, the subject of this story which we are considering. But after some time Eeke became entangled, for he saw a beautiful woman, Puuwaiohina from Kauaula, and they committed adultery. Because of this, Lihau thought to choke the child to death, so that the two of them could go and do mischief; this caused them to quarrel. Eeke took the child to his mother, Maunahoomaha, and left him with her. After that their god, Hinaikauluau, placed a restriction over them; they were not to live together, nor were they to have any intercourse with others; but ten days after this order, Eeke again committed adultery with Puuwaiohina above referred to, who was a younger sister to Lihau. Because of this their god punished them by making Eeke a mountain and Puuwaiohina a mountain ridge; that is the ridge prominent at Kauaula. There is, it seems, a hole below the highest point of this ridge. When sound issues from this hole, that is the time the kauaula wind blows a fierce gale."

That was agreeable to her mother-in-law, and when she met her child she was glad. When she realized what a handsome man her favorite son had grown to be, she gave him for husband to Molokini, one of the noted beauties of that time, because she was the wife intended for him."

He possessed also an eel body. That is why an eel is named Puhikanilolou. Arriving there, he saw that it was a land not as fair as Hawaii (but Hawaii was not the name at that time). Therefore he bragged, saying: “This can not compare in beauty with my country; there are no stones for the feet to strike against.”"
"A lohe o Pele i keia olelo kaena alaila pane mai la ia ia: “Hoi aku oe, aohe maikai o ko aina, ua paa i ke a-a mai uka a kai.” I hoi mai ka hana, a pae mua ma Kauai, he ino wale no; holo mai hoi a hiki i Maui nei, he ino wale no; a pela aku a hiki i Hawaii.","When Pele heard this boast, she replied: “When you return, your country is no longer beautiful; it is covered with rocks from the mountain to the sea.” When he returned and landed first at Kauai, he found the land destroyed; he sailed on to Maui, it was as bad; and so it was when he arrived at Hawaii."
"Eia nae i ka hiki ana mai i Maui nei, eia keia hana ino a ka Pele; ike ae la kekahi o kona mau pokii i ke kanaka maikai o Puulaina, nonoi aku la ia Molokini nana ke kane a laua. Hoole mai kela, no ka mea, ua kupouli loko ia Kanehoa i ke aloha o ke kane; nolaila, hoolilo ia aku la ia i wahi mokupuni a hiki i keia manawa.","However, arriving on Maui, this was one of Pele’s cruel deeds: one of her younger sisters saw how handsome Puulaina was, so she asked Molokini to let her have him for husband. The other refused, for she was greatly in love with her own husband; so she was changed into a little island, and she has remained so to this day."
"A lohe o Lihau i keia mea, he mea kaumaha ia i kona manao no kana hunona wahine, alaila, hele aku la ia, a kamailio pu me Pele no keia mea. Aka, olelo huhu mai o Pele: “Ina pela, alaila ke hai aku nei au e make ana oe; make pu hoi me ko keiki.” Ia manawa, lilo koke o Lihau i puu, a noho ka Pele malaila i kekahi manawa, a make pu iho la no hoi ke keiki; aka nae, o ka mea nona ka makemake, uwalo aku la ia me ke noi ana i ola ke kane, aka, aole pela ka manao o ua wahi makole-ulaula nei.

Ua hewa ke kapaia ana i keia manawa o Haleakala; o Aheleakala ka pololei.","When Lihau heard of this, she grieved for her daughter-in-law, so she went to consult Pele on the matter. But Pele replied gruffly: “If that is the case, then I say to you that you will die; also your son.” Lihau was there and then changed into a hill where Pele resided for some time; the son also died. But the one whose was the desire, earnestly entreated and begged that her husband be spared. But the red-bleary-eyed did not wish it that way. That was how the son became a hill and has remained such until this day. After this Pele traveled until she came to Aheleakala the large mountain of [ ] Maui at the rising of the sun. That is a misnomer, Haleakala; Aheleakala is the correct name."
"Wahi a kekahi poe, na ka Pele no i hoohuai mai keia puu. Aole puu malaila mamua, aka, i ka hiki ana mai o ka Pele, puka mai ai keia puu.

A no ke kupono loa i ka malu ulu o Lele i ka nana aku nolaila, kapaia aku la ua puu nei o Puulaina.","Formerly there was no hill there, but after Pele arrived, this hill was brought forth. But it was not given a name at that time; afterwards it was called Puulaina. This was the reason for so naming it: At that time a chief was living on the other side of the hill, and because he was tired of seeing it standing there obstructing his view, and preventing him from seeing the breadfruit grove of Lahaina, he ordered his men to go and construct a ti-leaf house on its top; and the hill was called Puulai. And because it was sightly to those viewing it from Lahaina it was called Puulaina."
"Mahope mai o keia mau mea i hai ia ae nei, kukulu iho la ua alii nei i ka heiau nui ma kela mana aku o ua puu nei, ma ka aoao makai, a malaila no e make pinepine ai na kanaka; a make kanaka, alaila, ma keia mana maanei e kanu ia ai, a no ka hehee aku o ka lepo i ka wa e eli aku ai ka poe nana e kanu ka poe i pepehi ia, no ka piha loa i kanaka, nolaila kapaia aku o Puuheehee.

When a person died, he was buried on this side, and because the dirt slid down when graves were being dug, on account of the great number of the dead buried there, this side was named Puuheehee. There are some graves on this hill, those of the brothers of Kamikioi, wife of Nuhi of Auwaiawao. What is suitable for us to reflect on is what we should preserve. D. M. K."
"O Maui he keiki keia na Hinalauae laua o Hina. O ko lakou nei wahi i noho ai aia ma Makaliua, maluna aku o Kahakuloa, akau ponoi mai Lahainaluna nei aku.","Maui was a son of Hinalauae and Hina. Their residence was at Makaliua, above Kahakuloa, and in a northerly direction from Lahainaluna."
AKAHI: NA HANA A UA KEIKI NEI I KONA WA ILOKO O KA OPU O HINA.,FIRST: WHAT THIS CHILD DID WHILE YET IN THE WOMB OF HINA.
"I ka wa o ua keiki nei e noho ana iloko o ka opu, a, ua hoomaopopo kona mau makua he keiki io keia, a i kekahi manawa malie kalae ka lani, omaomao na kuahiwi, pau ke poi kupinai ana a ka nalu, hele aku na kanaka i ke kaka uhu maluna o ka waa, a ma kahi kupono i ka lawaia, ike nae lakou nei i keia keiki e lele kawa ana me na hiohiona maikai.

Arriving at the fishing grounds, they saw a handsome child diving from the precipice into the water. He was given chase; he ran and hid in the waterfall at Makamakaole; the water fell from above, but back of that was dry; he waited there and finally came out thinking to get back to the mother’s womb; but he was again seen and again pursued. He ran and entered the house. Hina was making kapa."
"Komo ana ua mau kanaka a ninau ana: “Auhea la ke keiki i komo mai nei iloko nei?” “Aohe keiki; o wau wale no.” Ike maila kana kane, holo maila oia me ka manao e pepehi ia laua (nokamea he kapu ke komo kekahi kanaka i ka wa e noho wale [ ] ana ka wahine aohe kana kane ponoi).

Aole nae i hiki i ka wa hanau.","The men entered and asked: “Where is the child who came into this house?” “There is no child; I am alone.” Her husband saw this, so he came with the intention of killing these men (because it was against the law to have any man enter a house [ ] where a woman was and her husband not present). The husband asked: “Why are you here?” “We pursued a child. He ran and entered this house.” “There is a child, but it is in that one’s womb. What shall be done?” asked the husband. The men went to seek a pig, a white chicken, black coconut, red fish, red kapa and awa root, and offered them as sacrifice to the child; after which they went off. He was named Maui; but he was not yet born."
"I ka wa o ua Maui nei e noho ana, a, i kekahi manawa, nui loa kona aloha i kona makuahine no kana mea kaulai; aole e liuliu iho ke kau ana a ka la, puka aela no a napoo koke aku la no, kupu ka manao e kii i ka la e alehe, i hele malie.

Hele keia a hiki ma Peeloko i Waihee, luku aku ana keia i ka niu apau i lalo, kii keia i ka pulu, hana a nui, hele keia e alehe i ka la.","While Maui was living with his parents, he felt sorry for his mother because of what she had to dry. The sun did not tarry long on its journey; it arose and set very quickly. The idea sprung up in him to go and snare the sun so that it would go slower. He went and at the cape of Hamakua he saw Moemoe sleeping in the cave of Kapepeenui at Wailohi; he saw the sun rising at Hana; he climbed Haleakala and inspected it and found it satisfactory. He went back to his parents’ place; he noticed that the sun still kept on in its old ways. So he came along to Peeloko at Waihee and threw down a lot of coconuts; he secured a plenty of husk and with it he went off to snare the sun."
"Pane kikoi mai o Moemoe: “Aohe e loaa ka la, he lopakuakea;” pane aku o Maui: “Make kuu enemi, a ko kuu iini, make oe ia’u.” Hele keia a hiki i Haleakala, a kau pono maluna oia nei, e alehe ae ana keia i ka pulu niu, haki kahi kukuna, alehe hou keia pau na kukuna ikaika o ka la.

Oia ka mea i hele lohi ai o ka la. A o Haleakala e kapa ia nei, aole oia ka pololei, o Alehe la; no ke alehe ana a Maui i ke kukuna o ka la.","Moemoe called out sarcastically, “You can not catch the sun for you are a low down farmer.” Maui answered, “When I conquer my enemy and satisfy my desire I shall kill you.” He came to Haleakala, and when the sun passed directly over him he snared it with the coco-husk, and broke some of its rays; he repeated this and broke all the strong rays of the sun. He said: “I am killing you because you travel so fast.” The sun requested, “Let me live; you watch how I travel.” He looked and beheld that it traveled slower, so he desisted from going after it again. That is why the sun goes slowly. And the name “Haleakala” given to it now is not correct; it should be Alehela, on account of Maui’s snaring the rays of the sun."
"Ma ia huli hoi ana mai ana, a hiki i ko Moemoe wahi, aole kela, huli loa maila no a loaa i Kawaiopilopilo . Aia ia wahi mawaena o Kekaa ame ka ulu ko a Kimo ma; ike nae ua Moemoe nei, holo i uka, i kai pela kona hele kekee ana.

This place is between Kekaa and James’ canefield; Moemoe saw him, and it went on in an irregular manner, now towards the mountain and now towards the sea. Maui became greatly angered, so he flew right on and caught the other above Kekaha; he killed it; it turned, however, into a rock. That rock is still lying along there makai of the new road. Its length is nearly seven feet. While Maui was off on this journey his mother became pregnant with and bore another child, an owl."
AKOLU: KONA LOAA ANA I KA PILIKIA AME KONA OLA ANA.,THIRDLY: CONCERNING HIS GETTING INTO TROUBLE AND HOW HE WAS SAVED.
"I ka hoi ana o Maui a hiki i kona wahi hanau ai ma Makaliua, ike keia he pueo ke hanai ia ana e kona mau makua, aole no o Maui i hoowahawaha iaia.

Pela ke kiai ana o ua pueo nei a wanaao, aole no he moe iki o keia kiai.","On Maui’s return to his birthplace at Makaliua he saw that an owl was being raised by his parents. Maui did not treat him with contempt. What he did on his return this time was to go fishing. His favorite mode of fishing was pole fishing at night: one night he went out and while he was idling away a canoe came along looking for a [ ] man to be offered in sacrifice by the king; Maui was taken prisoner and brought to the chief at Halulukoakoa. This place is at Moalii, Maui, in a westerly direction from Lahainaluna. He was to be placed on the altar the following day. At this time Hina saw in a vision what was happening to Maui. So Hina and the owl followed along and at Pohakuawahinemauna Hina stayed there. This place is between Keawaawa and Kakonamoku . The owl flew on to where Maui was being guarded; the guards were not asleep. He saw that Maui was tied up with coconut-husk cords. The owl waited until early dawn, but the guard would not sleep."
"Olelo ae o Maui: “E Aina e, koia ka po i loihi.” Loihi hou ka po, a pau loa na mea apau i ka moe. Ke kono akula noia o ua pueo nei a loaa keia, a pai akula no ia i na mea i hoopaa ia ai, hemohemo aela; ko laua hele akula no ia a hiki i kahi a Hina i noho ai, o ke ao koke noia.

Pela i pakele ai o Maui i ka make.","Maui then spoke: “O thou Aina, retard the night that it may be prolonged!” The night was prolonged and everyone went to sleep. The owl entered and came to him; he struck at his bonds and they fell off. They set off; they came to where Hina was waiting. It was then daylight. Hina hid Maui [under the stone] and she sat right outside of him. The sun rose. She opened her sleeping garment and spread it on her lap and looked for fleas. The owl had flown to the height of Kekaa. The searching party appeared and asked, “Have you seen the man which was to be offered by the chief for a sacrifice?” “No; I have just now arisen, and because of the warmth of the sun I sought after the fleas in my kapa.” No sooner had the others gone when these started going mauka. The owl led, while Maui followed and Hina came last. They went on in this way until they arrived at home. That was how Maui escaped death."
"O ka pau keia o kahi i hai ia mai ia’u, a, ua hai ano nui ia mai, kona hele ana e kaapuni ia Hawaii ame na moku e ae, ame kana hia ana i ka lae o ka alae, a pela aku. Lemuel K. N.

Lemuel K. N. Papa Jr."
"Kekahi no keia o na puu kaulana o Maui nei, a wahi pana no hoi keia no ke aupuni Hawaii nei. Ua kakau nui ia no na moolelo ma ka Moolelo Hawaii.",This is one of the famous hills on Maui; it is a noted landmark of the kingdom of Hawaii nei. The stories concerning it are profusely written in the Moolelo Hawaii.
"Elike me ka manao ana o na kupuna o keia lahui Hawaii, na Papa mai no i hanau keia pae aina, a i ole ia na Wakea maoli i hana, me kona lima ponoi.

It may be that Kekaa was obtained through one of the agencies above guessed at."
"Eia kekahi: O Kekaa, oia kekahi kulanakauhale ’lii o Maui nei, i ka wa e noho alii ana o Kaalaneo, i alii no Maui Komohana nei, ua olelo ia, he nui loa na kanaka ma ia wahi; ua kukulu nui ia na hale, ua mahiai nui na kanaka i ka uala, maia, ko, a [ ] me na mea ano like e ae.

It is said that there were many people there. Many houses were constructed and the people cultivated a great deal of potatoes, bananas, sugar-cane, and other things of a like nature. From what I have been told that country [ ] from above Kekaa to Hahakea and Wahikuli, that country now covered with cactus in a northwesterly direction from Lahainaluna, was all cultivated; Kekaa became a city populated by a great many; this chief [Kaalaneo] also planted the breadfruit and kukui trees down at Lahaina."
"I kekahi manawa a keia alii e kanu ulu ana, a me kekahi o kona poe kanaka, hele no lakou mamua, uhuki mai no o Kaululaau i na ulu, mahope, ua kapaia kekahi o keia mau kumu ulu, S.

While they went ahead planting, Kaululaau followed after pulling them up. Some of these trees, southwest of the Lahaina fort, were called the breadfruit trees of Kauheana. This Kaululaau was banished to Lanai, where ghosts were plentiful, with the idea that he would be killed; but it did not turn out that way. After some time a fire was seen burning [on Lanai], therefore the chiefs wondered whether or not Kaululaau was dead on account of this lighted fire. The important point from these explanations is that Kekaa was the birthplace of Kaululaau, the famous one who traveled all over Lanai fighting the numerous ghosts there and made it a land fit to be inhabited by human beings as it is at the present time."
"O kekahi mea kaulana i hana ia malaila, o ke puhi kohola i ka wa e ola ana o Keokiko, he hapahaole ia.

When he was living this was one of his occupations, that is to cook whales; he gave a great deal of his time to this work. He caught many fish, he cooked many whales there during the years 1849–1859, if I mistake not. It was also a place for cooking sharks’ liver. At that place is a large pot for cooking whales, also a box for confining whales. Many people went there to see and examine that strange thing during those years."
"O ka make pinepine ana o na kanaka apau e hele mehameha ana: he mea kupanaha no keia i ike ia ma ia puu, mai kuu hoomaka ana mai e noho makai o Lahaina, A.D. 1859–1872, me he la, ua eiwa kanaka i make malaila, me ke akaka ole o ke kumu, o Keokiko no kekahi kupapau e waiho la malaila, a hiki i keia wa, oia kela mea keokeo maluna o kela puu.","Concerning the frequent death of all those who went alone. This was a strange phenomenon connected with this hill. From the time I commenced living down at Lahaina, A.D. 1859–1872, it seemed there were nine persons who died there without any apparent cause. Keokiko was one of the corpses buried there, and is there at this time; that is the white thing on top of that hill."
"O ka lehulehu loa o na iwi kanaka ma ia wahi; me he la, no ka nui loa o na kanaka ma ia wahi, nolaila, lehulehu loa na iwi kanaka me he la he mau tausani kanaka i make ma ia wahi, a malaila no hoi e kii mau ai ko Lahainaluna nei poe, i mau iwi na lakou ke hiki i ka wa e ao ia ai ka Anetomio a ua lehulehu loa ia mea malaila, ua uhi paapu ia na one.","Concerning the great amount of human bones at this place. On account of the great number of people at this place there are numerous skeletons, as if thousands of people died there; it is there that the Lahainaluna students go to get skeletons for them when they are studying anatomy. The bones are plentiful there; they completely cover the sand."

Some time a number of people came from Kaanapali (from the other side) going to Lahaina during dark. When they came to Kekaa stones rolled down from the top of the hill without any cause. Listening to it, it seemed as if the hill was tumbling down; the people going along were startled and they explained, “Kekaa is ghostly! Kekaa is ghostly!” Certainly this is a strange thing for this hill to do."

Sometimes the spirit of a person would return and re-enter the body, and [ ] cause it to come to life again; that is what has happened to those who are living again. Many souls came to this place, Kekaa. It is called the Leina-a-ka-uhane, the leaping place of the soul. Only the spirits of subjects go to Kekaa; the souls of farmers and the souls of chiefs go to the volcano when they die. If they have friends there some of them are driven back [whence they re-enter the body] and live again."

This person was Moemoe. The other desired to travel. When Moemoe slept, Maui was traveling, each according to his taste. While Moemoe was sleeping a freshet came down and covered him with debris, with the exception of his nostrils; a kukui nut, however, rested on his nostrils and commenced to grow. It grew tall and at the same time tickled the nostrils of Moemoe; so he awoke and said: “Here I am at my favorite pastime, asleep, and yet I am awakened by this cursed kukui tree.” So he made up his mind to give up this to which he was addicted and to search for his friend, Maui."

The first one who trod this pathway, however, was Eleio, the fast runner of Kaalaneo, the excellent king of that period."

The old order of things with its wickedness has passed away; we have entered a new era and its excellence. January 24, 1872. S. Kaha."

Of this hill is the saying by some people of this time: “Kauiki is beloved floating on the sea, as if it were a bird.”"
"A he wahi puu kaulana no keia, mai ka wa kahiko mai a hiki i keia wa.

First: How it originated; secondly, the famous localities near to or connected with this hill. Let us therefore examine some of the erroneous ideas of the olden time."

That this hill originated from the placenta of Hamoa, some claim that it originated [ ] from the parents of Pele and her host; others, from Kaihuakala and Kahaule, his wife; still others, from Kalalawalu; and these are their accounts: Pele, Hiiaka and Puuhele were born of their parents; Kahinalii was their mother. However, Pele and Hiiaka were born with human bodies, while Puuhele was a bloody foetus when she was born. The elders despised this body, because when they beheld it it was not a human body, but only a foetus of blood; so the two conspired and said one to the other: “It were better for us to throw away our younger sister. How can we care for it? Of course we would care for it if it had a human body!” So they threw away the bloody foetus without the knowledge of the parents."
"A ma ia manawa mai, ua hoomaka keia puu koko e hele, a halawai mai oia me Alenuihaha, oia kela moana mawaena o Maui nei ame Hawaii, a ua ninau aku o Alenuihaha i ua puu koko nei: “He huakai! e hele mahea?” Olelo mai ua puu koko nei: “E hele ana ma keia wahi aku nei la, i kiloi ia mai au e o’u mau kaikuaana, a oia keia la e hele nei la.”","From that time onward this bloody foetus kept on traveling; it met Alenuihaha, that is the channel between Maui and Hawaii, and Alenuihaha asked it: “A journey! whither going?” The bloody foetus replied: “Just going to see what is ahead here; I was cast away by my elders and that is the cause of this journeying.”"

When Nuu looked he beheld a most beautiful woman. She kept right on until she met Puuomaiai; she also was a good-looking woman. Puuomaiai asked the stranger: “To where are you journeying?” The other replied: “Going along to places ahead of here.” Puuomaiai requested that they be friends, and they became such. She was received; they ate, and after being satisfied they went along. While they were going Manawainui voiced a chant, thus:"
"Kau ka lia ia oe e ka malihini, Ke hele nei a maeele kuu manawa, He hoa paio paha, He hoa makaikai paha e?","A restlessness seizes me on account of thee, O stranger! It is causing numbness to my feelings. Is it an antagonist? Or is it a traveling companion?"

You had better be named Puuhele.” After their conversation the two came along until they arrived at Hana. Puuomaiai said to Puuhele: “I had better return; we have come together; there is yet another time for meeting.” Puuhele consented, at the same time saying: “I know not how prosperous this journey is; I may see you again or I may not,” and Puuhele kissed her friend on the nose."

Kanahaha first spied Puuhele, however, and she immediately became dead, her limbs extended and spread apart. When Puuhele came up, she found the other dead. This place Kanahaha is a hill from which gushes forth a spring of water to this day. Puuhele [ ] passed right on until she met Lehoula. Lehoula said to her: “What a beautiful woman you are!” Lehoula wished to follow her. Coming to Wananalua, Puuhele made a vow to stay there, and she said to Lehoula: “I have a great desire for this place; I came along looking for a good place to locate in, and I have just located it. Therefore I will abide here until my death.” Lehoula returned to her usual home."

When Kaihuakala saw her he came down and met her and spoke reprovingly. “By what right did you come here?” Puuhele humbly replied: “I came to see the country, and seeing this beautiful country, I vowed to stay.” Then Puuhele was killed, and buried. She used her divine power, the hill rose high. Kaihuakala named the hill Kauiki, and that is the name by which it is known to the present time; that also is the cause for the song some people use, thus:"
"Aia i Kauiki ka eke leta a ka makani, Kahi paialewa ia mai la e ka lau awa, Huli ka nalu o ke Anini i ka makani, I hoohuli no a huli i ka wai o Punahoa.","At Kauiki is the mail bag of the wind, Being tossed about by the heavy black rain; Facing is the surf of Anini to the windward, Facing so as to head for the water of Punahoa."

She brought it along to Koloa, Kauai, and there she wanted to cast it away, but the child did not fancy staying there. She persevered in carrying the child until they arrived at Kaena; again the child did not desire to be left there, so it was brought along until they landed at Kawaipapa, Hana, East Maui, and it was left with him; and there it stands until this day. That was the idea of some olden people."

To the east of Kauiki is Pueokahi; this place was so named on account of an owl belonging to the chief, Peapea. When the bird saw there were plenty of people, it flew to the door of the chief, indicating a multitude. Afterwards it was killed, and that was why it was called Pueokahi."
"A ma ka akau ponoi no hoi o Kahulili, a malalo pono no o Kauiki kona kumu, ua kapaia oia na lauoho o Puuhele. Aia mauka o Kauiki o Kaihuakala.

Kaihuakala is not usually seen; when Maui is calm, then that locality is seen. Then Papahawahawa stands forth and brags, saying, “Here I have lived, and yet this is the first time I have [ ] beheld the calmness of Maui; it is indeed clear, for Kaihuakala can be seen.” [One must behold] Kaihuakala mountainward and Kauiki seaward in order to complete one’s journey of sightseeing. Thus the saying by composers of chants:"
"Malie o Maui, ua ikea o Kaihuakala, O Kaihuakala kai uka o Kauiki kai kai, I poia e ke kui, Kaihalulu i ke alo o Kauiki, Hii Kauiki ia Mokuhano, Hii ke one ka Pueokahi, Hii waikoloa i Kailiili, Hii ka nalu ia Keanini, Hoea ana i Mokumana, He waa Hawaii e, Waikaakihi ke awa, Punahoa ka wai oneone ia ka Pueokahi, O Honuaula mauka o Kahulili ka iluna, Pau Peapea la i ke ahi.","Maui is calm, for Kaihuakala is seen; Kaihuakala mountainward, Kauiki to seaward. The surf breaks at Kaihalulu in the presence of Kauiki; Kauiki is nursing Mokuhano, Nursing the sand of Pueokahi, Nursing the cold wind from Kailiili , Nursing the surf of Keanini, Including Mokumana; A canoe from Hawaii [Enters] the harbor of Waikaakihi. With the water at Punahoa, the sand at Pueokahi, [With] Honuaulu mauka, [and] Kahulili on top, Consumed indeed is Peapea by fire."

Malaihi was the father and Kuhihewa was the mother. They lived together until the child had grown up, and his body had acquired strength, when Pumaia said to his father, “You will please let me go to see the club of my grandmother.” The father gave his consent. The son went, and arriving at the house of Kiha, his grandmother, he asked, “Where is the club?” “Here it is,” said the grandmother. He took it. The nets of calabashes were thereby dashed to the ground and broken to pieces. He shouldered the club and commenced his journey. He caught up with Wakaina, and the latter inquired, “Where are you journeying to?” “Going sightseeing,” replied Pumaia. “Please let me go with you.” Pumaia consented and they went along."

That man, however, had a dual body, while these had the ordinary living body. Pumaia asked Wakaina, “Which of us shall be the first one to fight with this man?” The other replied, “It is better that I do it.” Pumaia consented and Wakaina went to fight Puukolea. Before they commenced fighting, however, he chanted a portion of a song, thus: [ ]"
"Aia, la, aia la, o ka lehua wale o Puuoni, Ke a uume inai la me opua i ka lewa Maluna malalo ka wai opua.","Behold! behold! the mere lehua of Puuoni, Struggling with the clouds of the air, Now above, now below the rain clouds."

You are provoking me through your song!” Wakaina had not completed his song before they commenced to fight. From afternoon to near midnight [did they fight]. Wakaina said to Pumaia: “You simply look on and do not come to aid me; I am nearly dead.” Pumaia jumped in and fought with the other, while Wakaina went to seek food for them. They kept on fighting until Pumaia was weakened. He thought of his club; so when Wakaina came back and inquired, “How are you?” he answered, “I am weak; go and fetch my club; perhaps it can do something.” While they yet spoke the other man appeared in a different body. They fought on, and before Pumaia could reach for his club, he was killed by this man; Wakaina also was killed. Their spirits returned to their parents and were seen by them. (The parents of Wakaina had gone over and were living together with Pumaia’s parents.) While they were idling away their time a chant was voiced by the wandering spirits:"
"Ko mai ana ke ano io maua nei, E kii mai ana ia maua e hele, Aole e hiki ua paa ia Waiauau, E kii mai ana ia maua e hoola—e E ola no—e.","Fear is creeping over us, Coming for us to go; We can not; we are held by Waiauau. Come to give us life! Life—indeed."

Meanwhile the two had gone as spirits until they met Pupuilima. Some people saw these two coming, but Pupuilima said: “Those are not men; those are ghosts.” “How do you know those are ghosts?” said the others. So they laid wagers. Pupuilima then said to them, “I will spread an ape leaf on the ground; and if it breaks, then they are men, but if it does not, then they are spirits.” He spread it. Meanwhile Pumaia said to Wakaina, “There is our death being prepared.” “How shall we be saved?” Pumaia explained: “Where my feet tread there you tread; because I was raised from my young days until I died, and until I found you; for this process is like that done to Pamano when by the spreading of an ape leaf he was saved.” So when they proceeded Pumaia trod on the ape leaf and it broke through; the friend treaded after him. They were chased by the prophet until they were caught. That is what I have obtained."

They came along until they caught up with Pueonuiokona. The owl, however, did not catch sight of them while they were coming. When they had passed ahead the prophet who was chasing them caught up with Pueonuiokona. The owl asked, “What is the cause of this heavy breathing and this perspiring?” This one answered, “That you should be asking [ ] ‘what’? Spirits! and there they are! I am chasing them, but can not catch them; I have been wishing to get near them so that I can kill them, for I am possessed with great anger towards them.”"

Ia laua nei nae e hoomakaukau ana e kii i na uhane, olelo aku la o Pumaia i ke aikane: “Eia a’e ka make o kaua la, aka, i kali auanei kaua a i oi kela mea hou mamua o ka mea mua, alaila, manao ae ke ola.”","When the owl heard what the prophet said, he said to him, “You are a prophet, and I am a prophet, still I did not see them; and now I hear you saying that if you catch them they die.” Where they were holding this conversation, however, was on the plain of Kamaomao. While the others prepared to come for the spirits, Pumaia said to his friend, “Here comes our death; but we will wait. If the new one gets ahead of the old one then we have hope for life.”"
"O ko laua nei noho iho la no ia nana no laua nei i ua mau makaula nei. A oi no o ua o Pueo mamua, olelo aku o Pumaia i ke aikane: “Akahi kaua a pakele, e aho e uhaele kaua a kahi o na makua o kaua; malia paha, o loaa ae kaua ilaila.” Ae mai la ke aikane.

When Pueo distanced the other, Pumaia said to the friend, “We are now saved; it were better that we go to our parents. It may be that we would be found there.” The friend consented. They came along Kealia, a large pond even to this day. These places above mentioned, the plain of Kamaomao and Kealia are at the eastern isthmus of Maui, connecting East and West Maui."
"E waiho ae kakou no ua mau akua lapu nei, a e kamailio kakou no na makaula.

While the prophets were following, and because Pueonuiokona was the faster, an idea occurred to one of them, and he said to himself, “If I catch up to that prophet I shall kill him, for he is simply going after my enemies to save them.” The owl went along slowly until his fellow prophet thundered after him and gave his hand a jerk. Pueo asked, “What wrong has a fellow committed that you should tug at the arm from behind and thereby nearly tripping me?” The other replied with blazing eyes, “Who told you to go after my enemies with the intention of saving them? Why don’t you look for your own, and on them practice saving?” The owl replied: “If you excel in strength you can obtain them, but if you are weak you can not have them; because I, even I, am an old resident of this plain. When spirits from the dead arrive I cause them to revive. Also no prophet comes to this plain; this is the first time that I have seen a prophet on this plain, and that is yourself. Because you complained of my desire to give life to those spirits, so be it! By a test of strength will [we know] whether you obtain them or I do.”"

On the island of Kaululaau lived the subject of this story, the champion of that past age. Let us glance briefly at the occupation of the parents. While they were living together the woman [ ] realized that she would obtain a beautiful fruit from her womb. The husband was a fisherman who used to go fishing for them, and he passed long periods at his occupation. One day Kapokoholua sailed out on the ocean in a canoe to fish. When he had gone Puupehe commenced a conversation from inside the mother’s womb. When Puupehe spoke the mother was startled from her sleep, and she wondered at this strange sound which she heard. She went to sleep again; the live one called out, “Say, my dear mother, do thou awake; father is dead.” The mother then realized that it was a human voice, but she could see no human being. She ran quickly and stood at the door of the house and looked round for the owner of the voice, but she could see no one; she thought, however, that it was her husband, but she was disappointed. She returned and sat in the house. The child voiced a chant thus:"
"Aloha au o kahi wai a ke kehau, Oia wai haaheo mai iluna o ka laau. A ua mai ka ua i na pali E hoopiha ana i na kahawai. O ka waiwai no ia a kuu maka o ka ike aku. A ike kuu maka a nehe kuu lima.","How I desire the moisture of the dew, That water proudly hanging on the tree; When the rain falls on the precipice It fills up the streams. That is the benefit my eyes behold! My eyes to behold, my hands to rustle."
"A pau ke oli ana a ua keiki nei, ua ano e mai la ka makuahine, a ku a pilikia maoli ia. E pono e wehewehe iki aku wau i ke ano o kana oli ana a me ke kamailio hoopunipuni ana ua make ka makuakane; aole he oiaio o ke ano o ke oli ana. Ua hele ia e nana i ka lawaia ana o kona makuakane, a ua kii aku ia i na i’a he nui loa e hele e ai i ka makau. No ka ike ana ua nui na i’a i loaa i kona papa, ua koe hoi ka lua, oia ka awa. Ua ike ia aohe awa a kona mau makua, nolaila oia i puana ae ai i keia mau lalani mele e kau ae la maluna.","When the child finished chanting his mother became possessed and was greatly troubled. I had better explain shortly about his chanting and falsely stating that his father was dead. It was not true as he chanted. He had gone to watch his father fishing, and he had sent for a great number of fish to come and bite the hook. He saw that his father had caught a great many fish, but he needed the second [requisite], the awa root. He knew his parents had none; that was why he voiced the few lines of song above written."
"E waiho iki kakou i na hana a ke keiki a mahope aku. E huli ae kakou a kamailio no ka makuakane. A i kona makua e lawaia nei, ua nanea loa ia i ka nui o na i’a i loaa iaia, a i kona nana ana mai iuka aohe ike ia aku o uka, no ka mea ua uhi iho la o Puupehe i ka ohu a nalowale ka aina.

While his father was fishing he became very much interested because he caught so many. When he glanced shoreward he could not see land, because Puupehe had covered it completely with fog. He thought to himself, “What can this wonderful thing be? There is now no wind to bring the fog on to the land!” He had a premonition, however, concerning his wife, so he commenced to pull in his line. When it was near the top his line was held by a shark. The name of this shark was Puaiki."
"E kamailio iki ae au no keia i’a ino.

When he realized that it was a shark holding on he jerked the line; the fish took him to a point near the cape of Papawai here on Maui; from there he again came outside of Manele. He noticed that their house was surrounded by a many-colored cloud. When he arrived at his old fishing ground his line and hook were broken off. He returned and when near shore he saw his wife standing on the seashore beckoning to him. He said to himself, “You are unaccountable, my wife; you can see that I am returning.” With one scoop of his paddle in the sea the bow of the canoe landed on the sand. The wife ran to him and grasped him tremblingly. He asked, “What is the cause of this heavy breathing?” She replied, with tears, “Our child has acted the ghost to me.” “ For what reason?” “For this reason: soon after you were gone I went to sleep and slept [ ] soundly. A voice called, ‘Say, my dear mother, do thou awaken; father is dead.’ I was startled out of my sleep; I thought it was you. Not long after that a voice chanted!” The husband said, “Do you remember the chant?” “Yes,” said the wife."
"“Oia iho na hana kupanaha a ke keiki a kaua ia’u i noho iho nei.” I aku la kana kane: “Ina he oiaio kena olelo au, e pomaikai ana kaua ma keia hope aku. Na ke au o ka manawa e hoike mai a e hooko, nolaila, e kali kaua ma keia hope aku.” Hapai aku la laua nei i ka waa, ua hele a piha u oloko o ka waa i ka i’a.

Amama, ua noa.”","“Those are the queer things which our child did to me while I stayed here.” The husband replied, “If those which you have stated are true we will be benefited hereafter. Time will show and bring them to pass; therefore let us wait for the future.” They lifted the canoe; it was heavily laden inside with fish. They returned, and reaching the house they salted the fish; the wife broiled some and when done the two prepared to eat; they prayed to this child as follows: “In the name of Puupehe, grant us eternal life. Amen. It is free.”"
"Ai laua nei a maona, hoomakaukau no na mea e pili ana no ka moe ana, a i ko laua moe ana iho i ka po, o ka hana a ua keiki nei o ka hele e makaikai i na hana a kekahi kanaka, e ao ana ia i kana poe haumana i ka oo ihe, a me ka lele ana iluna o ka ipu huawai, a pela uku. E ao ana a ike hele e kaua me kona mau makua me Kapokoholua ma.","They ate until satisfied, then made preparations for sleeping. While they slept that night the child went to watch what one man was doing; he was teaching his pupils the art of casting the spear, and how to fly on to a water gourd, and so forth. He was teaching them with the idea that when proficient they were to fight with his parents, Kapokoholua and his wife."
"I ka hele ana a ua keiki nei, ua mimino iho la ka opu o Kapoiliilii, olelo aku la ia i ke kane: “E ianei e! e haha mai oe i kuu opu.” Haha mai la ia: “E, ua emi iho nei ka ko opu.” “ Kupanaha,” wahi a ka wahine. I aku la kana kane: “Mai haohao oe ua hele aku la e makaikai ma kela wahi keia wahi o ka honua.” Hoi iho la laua hoonanea iki, kani ana kahea a ua keiki nei: “E laua nei e, e ala, e hoa i ke kukui.” Ala ae laua hoa aku la i ke kukui. “E puhi mai olua i paka no’u, a e mama iho i kuu wahi opuupuu awa, aia maluna ae o ka puka.”","When the child had gone the womb of Kapoiliili contracted, and she said to her husband, “Where are you? Please feel my belly.” The other felt of it: “Why, your stomach has shrunken!” “Strange!” said the wife. The husband said, “Do not be troubled, he has gone to see the different parts of the world.” They retired awhile for a short rest, when the child called out: “You two, awake, light the lamp.” They awakened and lit the lamp. “You two smoke up some tobacco for me, and chew my piece of awa root; it is above the door.”"
"Hoaa iho la laua, no ka mea, aole he inu awa o laua, nolaila, pahaohao laua no ia mea, pane mai la ua keiki nei, me ka huhu: “E aha ana ka hoi olua e lohi nei, a hele au i ka’u hana o ka makaikai.” Ua hooko koke aku la kona makuakane a makaukau na mea i hana ia, kena mai la e pule; pule ae la ka makuakane e like me kana pule mua ana, hoole mai la ia. “Aole ia o ka pule e ola ai ke hiki mai ka pilikia ia olua.” I aku la ia: “Pehea ka pule e ola ai?” “Penei, e hoopaanaau oe.” Hai mai la ia:","They were puzzled, because they did not drink awa; therefore they were undecided as to what to do; the child spoke with heat, “Why are you two so slow? [for I wish to] go on my business of sightseeing.” His father hastened to obey, and when everything was ready [the child] commanded him to pray. The father uttered the same prayer which he offered before; the other wouldn’t have it so. “That prayer will not save when trouble comes to you two.” The father asked, “What is the prayer which will save?” “Thus, and you must learn it by heart:"
"Eia ka ai e Puaiki e. Molia i ku ia i ka hoopea wale, I ka awaha wale mai, I ka make wale mai, Owau nei o Kapokoholua, [ ] E ola ia’u a kanikoo; O kau ola ia e ka akua.","Here is food, O Puaiki! Curse those who deal falsely, Who are envious, Who wish us death! Here I am, Kapokoholua! [ ] Life for me until I walk with a staff: That is your life, O god!"
"A pau keia hoopaanaau ana a laua nei, ai iho la no ua makuakane nei, oia wale no, no ka mea na ka makuakane e ai; i ke aka wale no ka ua keiki nei e ai mai; pela kana mau mea e makemake ai e olelo mai ai i kona mau makua.

When the father had finished eating, the child called for the second kind of food, that was the tobacco. After smoking the tobacco the child returned to the womb of the mother. The womb of Kapoiliili became as large as it was formerly. The wife said, “I think perhaps the child has returned to my womb.” “Why so?” asked the husband. “I am swelling,” replied the wife. “Do not wonder, because he is satisfied; he has returned to rest, and when his fullness is lessened he will go about his business of sightseeing.”"
"Pau wale iho la no ka makau o kana wahine, no ke ano makau paha i ke kane. A i ke kokoke ana e ao ae ua po nei, ua hele ua keiki nei elike me ka mea i hala ae nei mamua.

And when it was nearly morning the child went off again as usual. I will leave this part until later. I wish to speak of the [number of] months this child was in the womb of his mother, and the cause of its going about while still in the womb. This child had been thirteen months in the womb when it acted in a ghostly manner to his mother, as stated heretofore. They (the parents) had wondered why the child was not delivered, because the time for the delivery of the child, twelve months, had passed. With their child there was no birth. In this matter they were greatly in suspense [and were surprised], because it walked about while still in the womb; its face was not seen; it talked as if it were a shadow at a distance."

Maui took to wife Hina and begat Mauimua, Mauihope, Mauikiikii and Mauiokalana; they were all boys. The occupation of these boys was fishing. This was their practice in fishing while living at Kaupo, Maui: Mauiokalana wished to go fishing; he said to his elder brothers: “Say, this is a calm day; shouldn’t we sail the sea? for this is a good day, the sea is calm; this is a day when the tide is not strong in its opposition for it is flowing in one direction.” When he had finished speaking, Mauimua answered: “Let us not sail, for this will be a tempestuous day; this calmness which we see is only in the morning; when the sun rises you will see the waves rise, the wind will increase, and in a short time we will be obliged to return. Put off your fishing until a calm day.” Then Mauiokalana spoke again: “Why, I thought because you are the first-born you knew the signs of the sky, but I see you do not! Your yellow teeth signify nothing.” Then Mauimua, displeased, answered: “Say, my younger [ ] brother, you do not realize that I am the one acquainted with the ways of this place. This is the sign I know about: when you sleep until near morning, and should hear the breaking surf above the wind, then it will be calm. That is my sign, that you may hear, my younger brother. But what of it? let us sail according to your urging.” Mauimua ordered the canoes lifted to the beach. The canoes were taken to the shore, and they prepared to sail for fishing. When they arrived at the reef they saw a fire burning on land. Then Mauiokalana said to his elder brothers: “Say, there is a fire burning; whose fire can this be?” The others replied: “Whose indeed? Perhaps we had better return so we can cook some food for us.” “Pshaw! Let us first go and get some fish, then return; so that when we get back with fish we can broil them, cook the food, and then [we can] sleep well, being satisfied.” They went on; in no time they had caught some fish. They then returned. As soon as they arrived at the beach Mauimua left the canoe, and ran to where the fire was seen burning. Kaalaehuapi saw him so he and the others threw dirt on the fire and smothered it, and flew away. Mauimua was disappointed; he returned to their house. The others asked, “How about the fire?” “There is no fire; it is put out; I thought it was man, but it was not; some mudhens kindled the fire. Our bananas are being stolen.” Because they saw that their bananas were being stolen they did not go fishing; they hoped the fire would be kindled again, but it was not lighted. Then they went fishing again. Whenever they went out fishing the fire would burn. Thus were they harassed, but they could not get anything, because Kaalaehuapi knew that Maui and Hina had four sons. When they went fishing Kaalaehuapi counted them; when they were all present it would light the fire."

You will place our calabash in front where I sit. You will cover it with kapa. Then you will go to sea.” The others consented and they went. Kaalaehuapi saw them and counted Mauimua, Mauihope, Mauikiikii, Mauiokalana. He counted all present, so the mudhens lighted the fire and roasted the bananas. Before the bananas were cooked, Kaalaehuapi said, “Say, they’re done; Hina’s son is swift.” It was then Maui jumped to grab and caught Kaalaehuapi. Then he said, “I will kill you, you mudhen. You folks indeed have the fire and you are hiding it. I will kill you, you mudhen. Kaalaehuapi said, “If I die, the fire can not be obtained.” The other mudhens called out, “O Kaalaehuapi, hold on to the fire; do not tell.” Maui commenced to twist the neck of the mudhen, planning to kill it dead there and then. The mudhen again spoke: “Grant me life, then you will obtain the fire.” Maui asked, “Where is the fire?” “In the stalk of the ape leaf.” So he went to rubbing, but it would not light; he asked again, “Where is the fire?” The other directed: “In the stalk of the taro leaf.” He again went to rubbing, but it would not light; the stalk of the taro leaf became grooved, but no fire was produced; that is why the stalk of the ape and the taro leaf has a groove, because of Maui’s rubbing for fire. Again he asked, “Where is the fire which you are hiding?” “In the green wood.” He rubbed that, but it would not ignite. Again he asked. He kept doing this until it [ ] came to the dry wood; there he found the fire. When he had produced fire, he rubbed the head of the mudhen. That is why the mudhen has a red head as we see it now. And from that time was fire obtained and has been handed down to the present time."

It also helps in the work of man, because in cultivating some people use fire [to burn off rubbish] before planting the leaves. The fire has various other uses; they can not all be explained because the time is limited. R. Puiki."

The first-born of these people was a daughter. Luukia was her name. Sixteen years after she was born she went to Oahu. Before she went to Oahu, however, the mother was pregnant with Makahi; but she went off before the child was born; after a while it was reported back that she was married, the husband’s name being Kamauoha."

The property of very many people was won by this strong man. He had many friends, and also great wealth. After they lived for some time an idea occurred to Kaaiai, a man of Ewa, Oahu, who wished to test his strength. He came and stood in the presence of Kamauoha the warrior, and spoke animatedly, thinking that he could win. Kamauoha said: “What is the main reason for coming here?” He replied: “I came to see which of us is the stronger.” The other asked: “How shall we test strength?” “By piercing with spears,” replied Kaaiai. Kaaiai’s property consisted of three narrow strips of land, six sets of scented kapa, eight dogs, fifty hogs, four houses; those were what the man’s property consisted of. When they tried, Kamauoha inflicted the first pain; all the man’s property was completely taken over by the opponent, and he returned empty handed to his house. His wife asked, “And how was your journey?” “You ask how, indeed! The properties which we accumulated thinking that they would be added to were taken from me, and I returned stripped; the other’s strength was known and yet I dared provoke him, hoping to benefit thereby.”"

Whereupon all his relatives mourned, and if he was greatly beloved, they extracted something from his corpse, such as a nail, a tooth, or perhaps some hair. Here is another thing: if something was seen issuing from the mouth or the eyes, possibly a white substance accompanied with tears, the deceased truly loved his relatives; his corpse would then be kept uninterred four or five days, or even longer, to show their regard."

If there be anything which the deceased had, such as money, or clothes or other articles, it is buried with the corpse. Food is also left; fish, or tobacco, or kapa, it may be, so that the dead would not go hungry for food, or be cold; such is what I have heard."

The burial is done at night, however, not in the day time. In digging the grave, it is dug round like a banana hole. The usual depth of the grave is up to one’s waist, that is, up to the loin of a man. In the olden time, this grave was called a pahee (smooth place). Upon digging, take the dirt from the grave to another place in a fine mat, or a gourd, else the tracks would be shown. Should it be a new house, the friends of the dead would dig from the outside till they reached within, without the house owner knowing anything about it. The people thought that if the burial place was known, the bones would be taken for fish hooks, and the flesh for shark bait. There are some hidden graves among the precipices; others are on plains. There is a hidden grave at Haleakala; it is called the grave of Kaawa; it is right mauka of Nuu, on Maui. This is the way the corpse is treated before being thrown into [ ] that hole. When the friend of the dead takes the corpse, he takes also what the deceased was fond of when living: If he was fond of pork, banana, or perhaps sugar-cane, etc., he takes them; and upon arriving at the grave, the friend of the deceased calls to the departed ancestors first buried in that grave, thus: “So and so, here comes your descendant.” If the corpse should keep falling until it drops into the water, and a rainbow appears, then it is without relatives; but the corpse who has relatives is grasped by them when the body is thrown, and is stranded on the precipice, and not dropped into the water. After the burial [they] come home and mourn. Another thing: If the corpse is being carried, and the one he loved is far in the rear, no progress would be made, for the deceased would demur. The one he loved should be immediately behind, then there would be no demurring. This is what the friend of the dead should say: “I thought you loved me, but you do not; if you act like this, your bones will be broken.” When he has finished saying that, the corpse will acquiesce, and it will be light work carrying it to the place of burial. The grave should be well lined, and the corpse laid to rest, the head towards the east, the feet towards the west. It is wrong to lay the corpse with the head towards the west, for it would appear as a ghost. When the body is buried, the friend should repeat these words: “Do not go wandering to houses, but stay quietly here; you have food, fish and clothes.”"
"Eia kekahi. O kekahi poe, ike lakou ua make ke kanaka, holehole ia na iwi a pau ka io, hana no ka i pahi, i makau, a i ole ia kau malie no iloko o ka hale i noho no ke aloha, hele aku no e nana. A o kekahi kupapau, ua lawe ia ma ke kai e kiola ia ai, a ma ka wai paha, i akua mano a me ka moo lakou.","Another thing: Some people when they see that a person is dead would strip the flesh from the bones and make them into knives or fish-hooks; or else they would be hung up in the house, so that the loved ones may go and see them. Some of the corpses are taken to the sea or water and thrown in, so that they may become shark- or lizard-gods."

Hanohano and Alalakeiki are others. At Alalakeiki a number of men from Hawaii who had brought a corpse to be hidden were killed. When those men from Hawaii had gone into the cave a man of the place, Niuaawaa by name, came along and closed up the mouth of the cave with stones, and those people stayed in there until they died. There is no living man who knows any of these secret burial places, so well hidden are they."
"Aneane kulike ole ka manao o na kanaka Hawaii nei no ka uhane mahope iho o ka make ana o ke kino.

They say that the soul has three abiding places, namely: the volcano, in the water, and on dry plains like the plains of Kamaomao and Kekaa."

And the servant of Pele will be his caretaker, who will lord it over his stewards or even over his own body servants. When the soul is living there, should some one wish to see it, then this is the process: go with a servant of Pele, and he will call by chanting one of the chants of that chief."

Those that are buried by a body of fresh water will enter that stream and become a large okuhekuhe or tailed-lizard; and if buried on dry land, then they will enter the body of an owl, and such like. These things which are entered by the souls of men become guides to their friends who are living. This is what the soul which has entered these things would do: It would proceed and enter his friend, and when it has possessed him, the soul would eat regular food until satisfied, then go back. And he would repeatedly do that. And this friend, should he have any trouble on land, such as war, then the owl would lead him to a place of safety; and if in fresh water, the lizard and such like would keep him safe; and if the trouble is in the ocean, the shark and such like would care for him. This is one reason why a great many people are prohibited from eating many things."

This name applies to wherever in Hawaii nei people lived. Following are the places where the souls live: For the people of Niihau, Kapapakiikii, and a second one is at Mauloku, Lehua; for the Kauai people, at Hanapepe; for the Oahu people at Kaimalolo; for the Molokai people, at the boundary of Koolau and Kona, at the district of Wainene; for the Lanai people, at Hokunui; for the Maui people, there are two places, at Kekaa and the plains of Kamaomao; and for the Hawaii people, there are three places, at Hilo, at Waipio, and at Palilua. All these places are known as the casting-off places of souls. Should a soul get to any of these places it will be impossible for it to come back again."

The chiefs have a separate place to dwell in, and the warriors have a different place. Sports are carried on there as during real life, such as throwing the spear, guessing the hidden no’a , coasting down hill, surfing, fencing, wrestling; there is plenty of food, food which needed no cultivation, such as potatoes, taro, ape, etc.; and because of this people think when the body is dead the following should be provided: Food, fish, tobacco, water, steel on which to strike flint and obtain fire, o-o , spear, axe, knife; because they think the soul will need these things to work with at that place."

Pele and Hiiaka lived at the volcano of Kilauea, but nobody knew exactly where Kaohelo settled on Hawaii. Yet while so living she bore a son named Kiha. When Kaohelo was nearing death she said to her son, “Should I die, do not bury me at any other place, but take my body to the very navel of your grandmother, right on top of Kilauea; then bury me there.” When Kaohelo died her son took her dead body: that is the creeping part as well as the bush-plant part. The flesh became the creeping vine and the bones became the bush-plant. Pele retained Kaohelo’s head, which became the smouldering fire in the volcano; the rest of the body was thrown over to Haleakala, Maui, and to salty Kealia, Oahu; some of it was thrown on Kauai, and some of it was left on Hawaii. When Malulani, living on Lanai, heard of the death of their youngest sister, she came over to get her, thinking that Pele hadn’t kept her; when she arrived she did not find her whole body. It was scattered and lost over the ground, and it was sprouting and growing from the soil. She commenced to gather and bundle it, thinking that that was all, as she wanted to care for it. But some time after, as she went back to Lanai, she saw Kaohelo’s body strung and worn as leis by the people; and because she loved her youngest sister very much she hung herself."
"O Kaohelo no hoi, oia kekahi akua o Pele a hiki i keia wa. Make iho ’la hoi o [ ] Malulani laua me Kaohelo, koe ihola o Pele me Hiiaka.

Malulani and Kaohelo [ ] died and left Pele and Hiiaka. While they were living together, and because Pele continued the fire whereby Hiiaka could not get enough sleep, she (Hiiaka) said to her older sister, “Why do you kindle the fire? I can’t get enough sleep on account of my back being heated by the fire. It is better that we let our younger sister go, and let her find a place of residence.” So Pele then let Kaohelo go. She went along until she arrived in Koolau, Oahu; Heeia was a good-looking man of that time living there, but he had died. When his soul saw her soul they greeted each other as strangers do, and he took her to his home; passing the time pleasantly for a few minutes, Heeia asked Kaohelo, “Where are you traveling to, and where did you come from?” She replied, “Why, Hawaii is our place of residence with my elder sisters, but I died. And because the back of my elder sister, Hiiaka, was heated with fire all the time, she told our eldest sister to send me away, and that is why I have been traveling to find a place where I might dwell.” When Heeia heard these words of love from Kaohelo he was saddened, and his whole body responded with sympathy and love for this woman. So he hastened to say, “Why not then be my wife and let me be your husband?” The idea was pleasing to the beautiful queen from the border of Kahiki, and they lived as man and wife."

After they had lived together for three years, she told her parents that she would go and bring Malulani from Lanai. This was agreeable to the parents. As she went over to Hawaii, Hiiaka said to Pele, “Say, here comes our niece.” Pele replied, “Whose niece is she? Why should I accord her recognition?” And this matter became a source of serious quarrel between the two. When the niece arrived at the mouth of the crater, at the place called Akanikolea, and looked down, she noticed her aunts quarreling. And because Pele was very angry she lighted the fire which filled the crater. Hiiaka feared the niece might die. So she went to get her brother, Ahuimaiapakanaloa, living in Nuumealani, the only one who could appease Pele. When the brother arrived the fire subsided. Then the niece went down, and when she noticed the banana was ripe she reached out and ate some. Thus she journeyed until she got down to the bottom, the fire meanwhile receding until it disappeared in the mouth of Pele. And when Pele recognized their niece, she said, “I thought you would die, because I did not recognize you, but I see your younger aunt was correct in telling me that you are our niece.”"
"Ia wa, olelo aku o Pele i ke kaikamahine: “E i ae no ka mea ai i luna.” Ninau mai ke kaikamahine: “Heaha ia mea ai?” Olelo aku la ka makuahine: “He ohelo, ua hele akula ia a pala, o ka makou no hoi ia e ai nei.” Ia lohe ana o ua kaikamahine nei, o ka pii aku la no ia a ike i ka pala o ka ohelo, lalau aku la keia a hahai mai la.

But when it was broken, blood flowed forth like a human being’s. She smelled it and it was stinking, so she left it and went down again. She said to Pele, “I thought it was a good thing you directed me to get, but when I [ ] broke it blood flowed out, and when I smelt it, it was stinking.” Pele replied, “Why, that is what we have been eating, but to you it has changed.”"
"A lohe o Waialani i keia mea, he mea-e kona kaumaha a me ka luuluu no kona ai ana i ke kino o kona mama aloha, olelo aku la keia ia Pele: “Ke hoohiki nei au ia oe, aole au e ike ana ia oe a hiki i ka lua kupapa’u.” Oia ka hookaawale ana o ko Hawaii nei, aole e kamailio kekahi i kekahi a hiki i ka wa e make ai, aia wale no a kalua ia ka puaa, a hana ia a pau, alaila ike i ka wa e ola ana, ina aole e hana ia kela mau mea, aia wale no ka palena he make, a he mea keia i maa ia Hawaii nei mai ka wa kahiko mai a hiki paha i keia wa.

If that is not done then they keep up this enmity until death. This is customary here in Hawaii; it has been the custom from the olden time to the present day."
"A hala kekahi mau la, o ka puolo liilii no ia o ua o Waialani i ke kino o Malulani a paa, hoolei liilii keia mawaho aku o Heeia, ku aku ana he puu, ku aku ana he puu a kinikini loa lakou e ku la a hiki i keia wa.

Then they stayed there, the women, the husband and the daughter. After some days Waialani made up small bundles of the body of Malulani which she scattered outside of Heeia, a hill here and a hill there until the place held many hills which are standing even unto this day. And because of the Flood, all these hills were submerged, and appeared as islets, and that is why it is called the sharp coral of Heeia; and it is there even to the present time as most of you know who have been to the place."
"Noho ihola hoi lakou nei, a no ka lanakila loa o ka manao o Heeia i ka ike aku ia Hiiaka i ka wahine oi kelakela o ka maikai, ua noho wale kela i ka lua o Kilauea a nohenohea pua i ka wao, o ka pii mai la no ia o ka manao kuko ino iloko ona e launa kino me Hiiaka, a ua hooko ia no nae kona manao.

They became husband and wife and lived as peacefully as the still water of Hauola. But poor Kaohelo was sad at heart because the Puulena (the cold wind of Kilauea) had gone on to Hilo, gone on to find a mate for it with which to ease its journey during that long travel; she had been left behind by the son of the shadowy precipices of Koolau. Because Kaohelo loved her husband very dearly she hanged herself, and thus endeth the story of Kaohelo. That is the story of how Kaohelo came from Kahiki and was spread about here in Hawaii."
"No Kauai na makua, o Manuakepa ka makuakane, o Hooleia ka makuahine. Noho ihola hoi laua nei a hanau mai la ka laua nei kaikamahine, kapa’ku la laua i kona inoa o Kaoheloula.

They lived together until a daughter was born to them. They called her Kaoheloula. The father’s name, however, is a famous name even unto this day, and it frequently occurs in songs, such as this:"
"Ka limu kaha kanaka o Manuakepa, Kapekupeku i luna ka ua o Hanalei, a pela ku.","The moss peoples the barren lands of Maunakepa: Spattering thereon is the rain from Hanalei, etc."

They found the kahuna, Kumakaohuohu, and they asked him for medicine: “Say, please give us some medicine for our daughter, because she is very ill. ” The kahuna replied: “You two can not get my medicine until you have given me something as a sacrifice for my sacred medicine, then would your daughter be cured.” So they got the daughter, and had the medicine applied to her, thinking that that would cure the child; but it did not. What the lying kahuna did killed her. When the daughter died she grew right into this ohelo plant, and it was thrown here and there until it grew all over Hawaii. That is how the ohelo was derived; it started from Kauai."

Because they were continually being reviled they felt ashamed, and they killed each other. These women when living, used to play a game whereby pebbles were thrown up; two pebbles, three pebbles, etc.; and while throwing up the pebbles, a chant would be recited, thus:"
"Puili puili ohelo ai a ka manu, Ke ai holoholo la i ka uka o Puna, a pela ku.","Seize, seize the ohelo, food of the birds, The food chased about in the wilds of Puna, etc."

Therefore, the subject of our inquiry concerns the indigenous canes of Hawaii. We had better consider the names of these canes, the reasons for assigning these names to the different varieties of canes, and the explanations relating to them. Here are the names of the old canes of Hawaii nei."
"Ko Mua: Ka inoa o keia ko, he Laukona. He mau kanaka elua, o Piikea kekahi a o Aulii kekahi.

Ua olelo mai ia i kana inoa: “He ko pumaia,” a ua nui ko laua hoopaapaa ana no ka inoa oia ko, a ua ko ko Aulii manao.","The first cane: the name of this cane is Laukona . There were two men, Piikea and Aulii. Piikea asked Aulii: “What is the name of this cane?” Aulii gave his name: “The name of this cane is Laukona; its leaf has long white stripes; that is why it is called Laukona.” Piikea disagreed with him on that name. He said its name was Pumaia. They quarreled a great deal over the name of this cane, and Aulii won."
"Ko Alua: Ka inoa o keia ko, he Papaa, mamuli o ke kapaia ana o kekahi aina o Kopapaa ka inoa; no ka hoopaapaa ka mea i kapaia ai o ia inoa.

[ ]","The second cane: the name of this cane is Papaa , so given because of a certain land being called Kopapaa, and this was derived from hoopaapaa (quarreling). This cane is of a dark color when young, and when it is ripe the dark color changes to red; its rind is hard when the cane is eaten. [ ]"
"Ko Akolu: Ka inoa o keia ko, he Manulele; ke ano o keia ko, he onionio keokeo, he loloa koi nei aina ke ai ia; ke kumu i kapaia ai kona inoa he Manulele no kekahi kane me kekahi wahine.

The characteristics of this cane are: it is white and green striped, and has long joints. The reason for calling it Manulele is because of a man with a woman. They lived peaceably as husband and wife, but after some time there grew up in one of them the desire to go astray, thus bringing about discord, and the husband or perhaps the wife is taken by another. The one remaining would still be very much in love, trying in various ways to occupy his mind, thinking this affection would soon pass away; but no, it would not cease. Then after a while some one who knows how to intensify love is heard of and is sent for, and upon arrival this kahuna would ask, “What ails you?” The man would respond, “The love of wife, that is why I am ailing; I do not desire food; I was fond of food and fish when living with my wife, but at this time we are contending together, I do not care for food.” The kahuna would say, “That is a sickness easily cured if I should treat you.” Then the sick man would say, “Suppose then you treat me.” “All right,” the kahuna would say. Then he would get this cane, that is, the Manulele, and would explain as follows: “This cane is Manulele (flying bird); her love will fly to you, she will cease her wanderings until you two are parted by death.” That is the name of this cane, Manulele."
"Ko Aha: Ka inoa o keia ko he Honuaula, ua ane like no ko i nei wehewehe ana me ko ka Manulele; he ko hana aloha no keia. O ko i nei ai ana he uaua ka aina.","The fourth cane: the name of this cane is Honuaula , the explanations pertaining to it are somewhat like the Manulele’s; this cane is also used for love-making. When this cane is eaten, it has tough peeling."
"Ko Elima: He Akoki ka inoa o keia ko; he ko eleele keia, he ulaula kona lau, he hukahukai ka ai ana, aole i like me ka ai ana o kela mau ko i hoikeia ae la maluna; o ka wehewehe ana nae o keia ko, aole i loaa ia’u, nokamea he pohihihi waleia i ko’u noonoo.","The fifth cane: Akoki is the name of this cane; it is a dark cane, and has red leaves; it is insipid when being eaten; it is not like those canes mentioned above. The characteristics of this cane I do not know, because they are not clear in my mind."
"Ko Eono: He Opukea ka inoa o keia ko; ua loaa keia ko i kekahi kanaka kaulana o ka wa kahiko, ma o kona imi nui ana a loaa iaia ma Laupahoehoe; a i kona nana ana, ua ike oia he ko Opukea.

He hunted for it until he located it at Laupahoehoe, and when he found it he noted it was Opukea cane; later he went and asked Liliha the name of this cane, and he was told the same name which he had already given it. When it is eaten the trash is brittle; the cane, however, is white in appearance."
"Ko Ehiku: He Uleohiu ka inoa o keia ko; ua loaa keia ko ia Kulua laua o Paiaalani.

This cane was discovered by Kulua and Paiaalani. While Kulua was lying very sick with chills and with sores covering his body, Paiaalani came to him and asked, “Why are you lying in the house these days and not going out?” Kulua answered him, “I am sick indeed!” The other asked, “What is your sickness?” “ Sores and chills,” answered the sick person. “That disease is easily cured if you will get that cane called Uleohiu; boil it in hot water, drink some, rub some on your skin, and you will be cured.” It is insipid when eaten, and is also soft."
"Ko Ewalu: He Palaniula, oia hoi, he Palani hao ka inoa, ke ole au e kuhihewa. Aole i loaa ia’u ka wehewehe ana o na kumu i loaa mai ai ka inoa o keia ko.

O ke ano nae o keia ko, he ulaula kahakaha loloa keokeo, oloko nae o kona aina, ua like me ka ai ana o ka Opukea ke keokeo, oia iho la ke ano o keia ko.","The ninth cane: the Ainakea ; the ones who obtained this cane were Kuula and Kane; these two had practiced sorcery on the people of Honuaula and left their bones bleaching in the sun. That is why this cane was called Ainakea, on account of the rascality of these men. This cane is red with long white stripes, but its trash, and in eating it, is like the Opukea, white; that is the kind of cane this is."
"Ko Umi: He Iliopua ka inoa o keia ko; koi nei wehewehe ana i na kumu i loaa mai ai kona inoa i kapa pono ia ai, aole i maopopo loa ia’u, nokamea, aole au i ike i ke ano oia ko.","The tenth cane: this cane is called the Iliopua . I do not know why it was called by that name, nor do I know anything at all about this variety."
"Ko Umikumamakahi: He ko Malolo ka inoa o keia ko; ke kumu i kapaia ai o ka inoa o keia ko, pela no kekahi wahine i hanau mai i kana keiki, a lawe ia ka iewe o ua keiki la a pili malalo o kekahi puhala.

Aole nae au i ike i keia ko. O kekahi mea i oleloia mai ai, he ko ailolo ka keia na ka poe kapili manu ke loaa ka manu mua.","The eleventh cane: this cane is called Malolo . The reason this cane was called by that name was because of a woman who bore a child; the placenta of the child was taken and left under a pandanus tree. The first name given to this cane was Puahala , but because this woman made religious observance this cane was called the Malolo. This is a tough cane, so it has been said by those who know, but I have never seen it. It is also said that this cane is used by bird catchers as an offering on snaring their first bird."
"Ko Umikumamalua: He ko Aweoweo keia; ua loaa keia ko ma ke kaua ana o Kamehameha me Kiwalao ma Mokuaweoaweo .

O ko ia nei ano, he onionio no, ua like no me na ko i haiia ae nei. Oia iho la na wehewehe ana o keia mau ko i loaa ia’u.","The twelfth cane: this is the Aweoweo cane. This cane was discovered during the battle between Kamehameha and Kiwalao at Mokuaweoweo . On account of the great number of people and the many who were dying they were hungry and thirsty; so when Pohina appeared with a bundle of cane Kiwalao inquired, “What is the name of that cane?” Pohina replied, “This cane is called the Ohia.” Kiwalao said, “You had better call that cane the Aweoweo.” That is the reason this name was given. This kind of cane is striped, somewhat like some of the canes mentioned above. These are the explanations concerning these canes which I have obtained."
"O ke kanu ana o keia mau ko, aole i like me ko keia manawa a kakou e ike nei; he okoa loa no ka kanu ana. O ka oo oia wa, he puhala kekahi; ua kii ia keia oo i Kahalaoaka i kahi nui o ka uluhala.

Some of the oo’s of that time were made from the wood of the pandanus tree; this oo was taken from Kahalaoaka where the screw-pines were plentiful; another [kind of] oo was made from Aalii; this was gotten from Kahikinui where the aalii was plentiful; and there were many other kinds of oo. When these oo’s were obtained, they were taken home and shaped; the cutting instruments used at that time were adzes, as we have already heard the explanations of those things."

Kamakea.","When these canes were first taken to be planted a hole was dug, but not as is done today. When planting at that time the dirt was simply brushed aside from the spot where you wished to plant the cane, and the seed was pushed in. That was the way [ ] of planting in the olden time. Perhaps there were other ways, but this is the way of planting which I have learned. Perhaps there are many other things but it is for you to seek them. January 31, 1872. D. K. Kamakea."
"O ka ohe, oia kekahi o na laau maikai o Hawaii nei, aole nae i like kona ano me na laau a kakou i ike iho nei, i ko lakou mau moolelo mamua; aole no hoi i like me kekahi mau laau e ae; aka, o kona ano he loloa, a he paukuku no hoi a he hakahaka oloko, a o kona lau, he liilii loloa, like me ka lau o ka ohe Kahiki a kakou e ike nei; aole nae he ulu wale mai o keia laau ma na wahi a pau; e like me na laau e ae ka ulu wale mai; aia wale no ma ke kanu ia aku e na kanaka; aka, e ninau iho paha auanei kekahi o oukou, me ka olelo ana: “Nohea la i loaa mai ai ka ohe, aia kanaka e kanu aku ai?” nolaila, i mau kumu e maopopo ai ia kakou, kahi i loaa mai ai o ka ohe, e me kana mau hana.","The bambu is one of the useful plants of Hawaii nei, but it is not like the other trees which we have heretofore noted; it differs materially. It is long, jointed, and hollow inside; its leaves are long and narrow like the leaves of the foreign bambu which we see here. This tree, however, does not grow everywhere, like other trees which propagate themselves; it must be planted by man. But some of you may ask the question, “Where does the bambu come from that man may plant the same?” Therefore, let us consider the source of the bambu and its uses."
"Ua olelo ia, mai a Hina mai i loaa ai ka ohe, no Kahiki mai. O ka oi nae o ka ohe ia wa, aia ka mawaho. Elua nae keia mau laau ana i lawe mai ai; oia hoi ka ohe, a me ke ahuawa, a ua kanu ia keia mau laau ma ka puka o ka hale.

The sharpness of the bambu at that time, strange to say, was on the outside. There were two plants that she brought over; the bambu and a rush, and these were planted by the side of the door. When Maui, the grandson of Hina, saw these plants growing by the side of their door, he went to pull them; but before he could loosen them, his hands were cut by the bambu; and when his grandmother saw that his hands were lacerated, she turned the sharp edge of the bambu inward. That is what we see now, the sharp edge of the bambu is inside; therefore it is clear to us that Hina introduced the bambu here in Hawaii."
"Hana mua. He makoi lawaia ia ka ohe. Oia kekahi mea, e loaa ai ka ia i na kanaka o Hawaii nei, ma ka hoopaa ia ana o ke aho, ma ka welau o ka ohe, me ka hoopaa i ka makau ma ka piko o ke kaula, a ua kapa ia o ua ohe nei, he makoi lawaia ia.","First: the bambu is used for fishing rods; that is one way the natives here in Hawaii had of catching fish, by tying a string to the tip end of the bambu, with a hook attached on the end of the string; such a bambu is called a fishing rod."
"Hana Alua: He aho hale. Oia kekahi hana a ka ohe, aia i ka wa kahiko, ua kii ia na ohe liilii kupono ke hana ia i aho hale, a oia kekahi hana a ka ohe. [ ]",Second: as house battens; that is another use of the bambu. In the olden times small sized bambus for battens (or sticks) for thatching a house; that was one of its values.
"Hana Akolu: He pahi ka ohe na ko Hawaii nei i ka wa kahiko. Aia nae ka wa e lilo ai ka ohe i pahi, aia i ka wa e nahaha ai, oia ka wa oi o ka ohe.

But the time for its use as such was when it was split up; that is when it is sharp. Another value of the bambu is in its use as a printing stick for marking kapa made by the women in the olden times, and even to the present day. It is split and shaped up as the skilful kapa makers desire it. That is one use of the bambu. [ ]"
"Hana Aha: Ma kona mau puna. Aia ma kona puna ua hana ia i huawai, aia nae, o ka ohe nunui ke kupono ke hana ia, oia kekahi hana a ka ohe.",Fourth: its joints. The joint sections are made into water containers when it becomes large enough for that purpose. That is another value of the bambu.
"Hana Elima: Ma kona lau. Aia ma kona lau he mea anai komo ia, i mea e maikai ai ke komo, pela no hoi ka ipupaka, a me ka ipulaau, oia iho la na hana a ka ohe.",Fifth: its leaves. The leaves of the bambu are used for polishing; it would put a good polish on rings; also on pipes and on wooden calabashes; such are the uses of the bambu.
"Eia kekahi o ka manao; no na ulu ohe kaulana. Aia ma Kuikuilaumania, i Hawaii, kekahi ulu ohe kaulana, e kokoke ana i ka wili ko o Kaupakuea, ma Hilo.

At Kuikuilaumania, Hawaii, is a famous bambu grove; it is near the sugar mill of Kaupakuea, at Hilo. The reason that grove is famous is because there are found fine large sized bambus; it is there also that bambus are gotten which are used in circumcising the Hawaiian youths; that is why the name of the grove is also called Homaikaohe."
"Eia ka lua o na ulu ohe kaulana, aia no ma Hilo i Hawaii, o Halai ka inoa oia ulu ohe kaulana. Ka mea i kaulana ai oia ulu ohe, no ka nui o ka ohe, a malaila e kii ia ai na ohe hiaku, a na kanaka o Hawaii; oia iho la na ulu ohe kaulana o Hawaii a’u i lohe ai; he mau ulu ohe kaulana hou aku no paha koe, na oukou nae hoi ia e hoike ae.","There is a second famous bambu grove, also at Hilo, Hawaii. This noted grove is called Halai (calm). The reason it is so famed is because the bambus are numerous. It is there that the rods for fishing the aku are gotten by the Hawaiians. These are the celebrated bambu groves of Hawaii which I have heard of. There are other notable bambu groves, but then it is for you to reveal them."
"Ko Maui nei hoi, aia ma Koolau, i Maui Hikina, o Pohakea ka inoa oia ulu ohe, o Hinai kekahi inoa ona, he wahi kahi olona ia nae ia e na kanaka i keia manawa, aka, o ka moolelo i kaulana ai oia ulu ohe, aole i maopopo i’au, oia iho la ko Maui nei ulu ohe kaulana a’u i lohe ai.

Timothy Lililea.","Here on Maui, at Koolau, East Maui, Pohakea is the name of a bambu grove: it is also known as Hinai. It is a place where the olona is treated at the present time. Why this grove became famous I do not know, but it is the only noted bambu grove that I have heard of here on Maui. Oahu has no famed bambu grove. Kauai is like Oahu; it has no noted bambu grove. Therefore, we know where the bambu came from, that is, through Hina; its place of origin and its uses; and the places of the notable groves hereinbefore mentioned. This is all that I have learned about the bambu. Timothy Lililea."
"O ka niu, aole ia he laau kamaaina no Hawaii nei mai kinohi mai, no ka mea, aole he kanaka nana i hoike mai, aole hoi he moolelo e hoike ana i ka oiaio he laau kahiko ia mai ka hoomaka ana mai o keia mau mokupuni.

And because of the lack of this testimony some people concluded that the coconut came from Kahiki."
"Elua manao no ke kumu i hiki mai ai ka niu i Hawaii nei. 1. I lawe ia mai e ke kai. 2. I laweia mai e Apua ame kona kaikuaana me Aukelenuiaiku, a penei ka wehewehe ana.

Oia moolelo ia no ka niu.","There are two conjectures as to how the coconut was introduced in Hawaii. 1. Brought here by the sea. 2. Brought here by Apua and his elder brother, Aukelenuiaiku, and here is the explanation: When the coconuts grew in Kahiki they were near the sea. As they bore fruit and the fruit matured they dropped here and there into the sea, and the ocean current brought some and landed them here on Hawaii. Upon being cast ashore and entering the sand they took root and grew and bore fruit. [ ] And when persons ate of the meat of the coconut they proclaimed [distributed] it from Hawaii to Kauai, even unto this day. That is one story concerning the coconut."
"Eia ka lua. O ka lawe ia ana mai e ke kanaka. Ua manao na Apua ma no i kii i ka niu i Kahiki a lawe mai i Hawaii nei, nokamea, he mau keiki laua no Kahiki a holo mai i Hawaii nei, aole nae i hoomaopopoia ko laua wahi i pae ai o Hawaii nei i kinohi. Ua manao ia nae ua pae mua laua i Puna, no ka loaa ana o kekahi inoa ma Puna elike me ka inoa o Apua, oia inoa no a hiki i keia wa, oia ka mea i manao ia ai ua pae mua laua ilaila.","Here is the second: Being brought here by man. It is thought that Apua and his brother went to Kahiki and brought the coconut here to Hawaii, because they were sons of Kahiki who came to Hawaii, but it is not known where they first landed on Hawaii. It is thought that they first landed at Puna, because there is a place in Puna called Apua, known so to this day. That is why it is thought they first landed there."
"Mailaila mai laua a pae i Lanai, ma ka aoao hikina o ka pali o Kaholo. O ka inoa i keia wa o Kaneapua ma ka inoa no o Apua i kapa ia ai. Ma ia holo ana mai nae a laua aole laua i lawe mai i na mea kanu no ka manao ua ulu na mea apau o Kahiki ianei. A no ka nui o ko laua pilikia pololi, nolaila, o ko laua hoi hou no ia i Kahiki i ka ai. I ko laua hiki ana i Kahiki, aole i pae na waa i ka aina, no ka nui o ke kai koo.","From there they came and landed at Lanai on the eastern side of the pali of Kaholo. The name of the place now is Kaneapua; it is derived from the name Apua. When they came that time they did not bring any plants, because they thought all the plants of Kahiki grew here. And because they got in trouble and were famished, that is why they went back to Kahiki for food. When they arrived at Kahiki, the canoes could not land on account of the high surf."
"I ka holo ana, o Apua, oia no mamua maluna o ka manu o ka waa nana e nana i ka pono o ka holo ana. I ka holo ana, ua hoopiha ia na waa i ke akoakoa i mea e hoopunipuni ai. Ia lakou e lana ana, ike maila o Kaulaku i na waa, manao maila he mau waa kuai ai, nolaila manao maila ia aole e hiki ke pae iuka no ka nui o ke kai, nolaila, hoikeike maila o Kaulaku i ka maia, ike akula o Apua a kulou ihola ke poo ilalo, i aku i kanaka: “E hoikeike aku i ka puna”; hoike akula lakou he puna wanawana ulaula e like me he ili maia la o waho me ka i ana aku o Apua: “E hai aku oukou he maia ia; ua ulu, ua kupu, ua lau, ua hua, aia no i Hawaii na hua.” A lohe aku la o Kaulaku i aku la oia i kanaka: “E, ke i maila lakou la he maia ua loaa no ka ia lakou aia no i Hawaii.” Ia manawa kiloi ia maila o ka hua, o ke kumu, o ka lau, o keiki; pau maila ia lakou nei, e ia nae ua pau lakou nei i ka pololi ia wa.","In sailing Apua sat on the manu of the canoe and directed its course properly. On their voyage the canoe was filled with coral rock for the purpose of deceiving. While they were floating outside Kaulaku spied the canoe. He suspected they were canoes seeking to buy food. He also thought they did not, on account of the storm. Therefore, Kaulaku showed them a banana. Apua saw that and he bowed his head and spoke to his people, “Show them a coral.” They picked up a large, coarse, red coral rock and showed it. It did look like a ripe banana outside, and Apua again said, “Tell them that what you have is banana; it has grown and sprouted, leaves have shot forth, and it has borne fruit; the fruit has been left in Hawaii.” And when Kaulaku heard this he said to his people, “Say, they are saying that that is banana, and that they have it at Hawaii.” They therefore threw out the fruit, the tree, the leaves and the suckers; the others got them, for they were sorely beset with hunger."
"Hoike hou ia mai no ke kalo; hana no lakou nei e like me ka hana mua, ua ulu, ua kupu, ua lau, ua hua, aia no i Hawaii na hua, o ka lakou la hana no ke kiloi iloko o ke kai pau no ia lakou nei i ka ohi.

They did for that as in the first place; they indicated that it has grown and sprouted; it has leaved out and it has borne fruit and the fruit was still at Hawaii: the shore people therefore threw the taro into the sea, and those on the canoe gathered them up. They did this until everything was gathered by those on the canoe, the plants and the leaves and put them in the canoes. Afterwards the shore people brought a tall tree which they stood in the sand, its trunk and its leaves. That plant in Hawaii nei is called Halapepe . When Apua saw this he instructed his men to erect on a canoe a large plant with branches resembling the coconut. They told the shore people that it was a coconut; that it had grown and sprouted, leaved and had borne fruit in Hawaii. Because they said this the halapepe was thrown into the sea, and they got it and put it into the canoes. The canoes were loaded with eatables, trunks and leaves when they landed in Hawaii nei."
"I ka hoi ana mai pae no i Puna; ilaila kahi i hoolei ia ai na mea a pau.

Oia hoi ka lawe ana mai a ke kai, a me Apua laua o Aukelenuiaiku.","When they returned they landed at Puna, and all the plants were landed there. The coconut was planted there at Kahaualea and Kalapana; that is where the first [ ] coconuts were first planted, and after that they were taken and planted in other parts of Hawaii nei. Some people think that is how the coconut was brought here to Hawaii, either by the action of the sea or introduced by Apua and Aukelenuiaiku."
"Pau ia. E imi kakou i ka waiwai o ke kumu o ka niu, ka hua, ka pulu, ka iwi, ka io, ka lau, a me ka niau. 1. Ka waiwai o ke kino o ka Niu i ka wa kahiko.

The value of the trunk of the coconut tree in the olden time. The trunk of the coconut tree was made into a dancing drum in the olden time; it is said that that kind of a drum excelled in sound. To prepare it, it was hewn to perfection. The [upper] end was covered over with the skin of the kala, or the shark. It was generally very well prepared."
"Eia kekahi. O ka hana ia ana i laau hale.

It was used for the houses of chiefs in the olden times, and often helped in the construction of large houses of the people and the chiefs. They were used for door posts, posts for the gates of pens confining animals, hat blocks for the women, even to this time. They are also used for a bowl in which to pound noni, hili, coffee, etc."
"O ke ano o keia laau he nunui, he loloa, he pokopoko no hoi kekahi. O kona mau lala aole i like me ko kekahi mau laau e ae e ulu nei.

O kona io he ono loa.","This tree is large and tall, though some are short. Its leaves are unlike those of other trees growing here. The leaves grow in a bunch in one place; their narrow lanceolate segments project in parallel lines. The fruit comes out of the body, sprouting out amid the hollow of the leaves. When the fruits first come out they can not be detected, for they are [encased] in wrappers; when the wrappers are broken through, then [the cluster of flowers] would be seen. When the flowers fall off, then the fruit [in a cluster] would be noticed hanging down. Its meat is very palatable."
"Ke ano o ka hua. Ke ano o ka hua he hua poepoe. Aole nae i poepoe elike me ke uliuliu ka poepoe, aka, he kihikihi o waho, he omuomuo aku o lalo. Oia kona ano.

Ekolu ona maka; elua maka ike ole, hookahi maka e puka ai ka wai.","Characteristic of the fruit: the fruit is somewhat round, but not round as is the uliuliu gourd, but somewhat ovoid with the lower part flattened. That is its appearance. Its meat is inside; when you have peeled off the husk, and broken the shell, then you come to the meat. It is as white as the snow on the mountain. Inside of the meat is a pool of water. It [the coconut] has three eyes, two of which are blind, and one through which the water comes out."
"2. E imi i ka waiwai o ka pulu. Ua hana ia ka pulu i kaula. Elua ano o ke kaula i hana ia ia wa; he kaula hili palaha, he kaula hilo maoli.

Let us consider the value of the husk. The husk was made into twine in olden time. Two kinds of twine were made in those days; a twine plaited flat, and a twine regularly twisted. The twine plaited flat was used for tying parts of canoes, for pahee cords and various other uses. If it is sold, one can make money, say five dollars for forty fathoms."
"O ke kaula hilo maoli ia. O kona waiwai he koko, he aho lawaia.

This was used for making netting for calabashes, and for fishing lines. There were many kinds of network of strings made in the olden times for the chiefs, and so forth; but if the calabash netting were to be sold for money, one, two, three or four dollars could be secured for each calabash netting. How valuable! Another thing: door mats for wooden houses of the white men were made of husks. That is the value of the husk. [ ]"
"3. Ka waiwai o ka iwi. Eia ka waiwai o ka iwi. He umeke, he ipukai, apu awa, puniu hula, komo lima, poho paka, he puna, he poho kui palu, he kiaha wai.","3. The value of the shell. Here are the uses of the shell: as calabashes, fish bowls, awa cups, hula calabashes, rings, tobacco containers, spoons, bowls for pounding bait, and water cups."
"4. Ka waiwai o ka io. Eia ka waiwai o ka io. He mea ono ka io o ka niu, ke wawahi ia i piha ke poi nui, kanana a maikai me he waiu la ke ano; a kalua ka uala a moa, alaila, lomi pu me ka niu a wali, i ka ai ana aku, aole o kana mai o ka ono, a kapa ia kona inoa, he poi palau.

The value of the meat. Here are some of the uses of the meat: the meat of the coconut is palatable; when it is scraped until a large bowl is filled and strained, it looks like milk; cook the potatoes and, when done, clean and mash, and mix with the milk of the coconut; when it is eaten it is exceedingly palatable; that is called the poi palau . It is also mixed with raw taro and baked in the imu. It must be tightly bundled so as not to flow in the imu (oven). When it is eaten it tastes like pork cooked under ground. This is called kulolo ."
"5. Ka waiwai o ka lau. I kinohi i ka wa naaupo o Hawaii nei, ua hana ia ka lau o ke niu i moena, i pa-u, i papale, i peahi, i eke lawaia, i mea lanai hale, a he mea kukulu hale. Ua olelo ia me ka lau niu i lele ai kekahi kanaka mai luna aku o ke kumu niu a haule iloko o ke kai.","5. The value of the leaf. In the olden time here in Hawaii the leaves of the coconut were used for making mats, skirts, hats, fans, and fishing baskets, cover for lanai of houses, and in thatching for houses. It is said that a man once used a coconut leaf with which to jump from a coconut tree into the sea."
"6. No ka aila. He aila kekahi waiwai o ka niu. Penei ka hana ana. I ka manawa opiopio o ka niu oia ka wa kupono e hana ai i ka aila.

I ka puhi ana ua like me ka aila o ke kohola ka aa maikai. He hamo lauoho kekahi hana.","6. Concerning the oil. Coconut is valuable for its oil. Here is how it is prepared. When the coconut is young, that is the proper time for extracting oil from it. When desirous of making some, a man must carry a tub and leave it by the tree, right under where the fruits are hanging then go for the young fruit, cut open the bud and let the water drip into the tub; when that is finished, repeat the operation at the next tree, and continue this until the tub is full, then pack it to the house and convert it into oil. When it is lighted it burns brightly like the whale oil. It is also used for dressing the hair."
"7. Ka waiwai o ka niau. Ua hana ia ka niau ma Hawaii nei i ka wa kahiko a maikai loa, he mea manai kukui, he mea niau kahili i haku ia me ka hulu moa, palahu, a me ka hulu manu e ae no na ’lii. Ua hana ia nohoi i mea kahili lepo no luna o na moku, a me loko no hoi o na hale moe o kanaka. He mea hula puili no ka wa kahiko. Ua hana ia no hoi i mea pahele aama.","7. The value of the midrib of the leaf. In the olden times here in Hawaii, the midrib of the coconut segments was separated with care and was used for stringing candlenuts; for props for the feathers of chickens, turkeys and other fowls when made into kahilis for the chiefs. It is also used in making brooms with which to sweep the decks of ships, and houses wherein people sleep. It was also used as a dancing instrument in the olden time. It is also used in catching aama (black flat crab)."
"O ia ka moolelo e pili ana i na mea a pau o ka niu, i imi ia me ka luhi. [ Kauwenaole. ]",Such is the whole story concerning the coconut which was sought with much weariness. [ Kauwenaole. ]
"O ka niu, oia no kekahi laau loihi e ku nei makai o Lahaina. O ke kumu i loaa mai ai ka niu, ua lawe ia mai e kekahi kanaka iwi loihi, o Kane ka inoa. No kukulu o Kahiki mai oia, a nana no i lawe mai.","The coconut is one of the tallest trees growing down in Lahaina. This is how the coconut was obtained: it was brought here by a man with very long bones, named Kane. He came from the border of Kahiki and brought it with him."
"Penei ke ano o ka lawe ana mai o Kane i ka niu. I ka wa mamua he pokole ua like me ka iwilei hookahi. I ka wa i kanu ia’i ua nui ka hana ana.

When it was planted it was attended by much labor. A man could reach for the fruit with his hand without climbing. But here is the strange thing: when a certain chief wanted coconut he ordered his servant to climb for some. When the servant reached for the coconut the tree lengthened and grew taller. He was surprised at this lengthening of the tree, so he climbed up. The tree grew taller until it was one hundred [ ] fathoms high; so he descended and went to the house of his master. The master asked him: “How about the coconuts?” “I did not get any; to be sure it is only low, but when I started to climb it grew very high.” The chief asked: “Then you did not meet Kane, the owner of the coconut?” He said he had not. The chief answered: “That is the reason you did not get any.” It was a famous saying among the children of that time that you can not get the coconuts of Kane. That was the queer thing about this coconut tree."
"Eia na mea waiwai o keia laau o ka niu. He ono loa kona hua, ua hana koele palau ia, a kulolo paha, a i ole ia he haupia. Pela ka hana ana o ka poe kahiko, he kapu nae, na ke kane wale no e ai. Ua kau ia no kekahi niu maluna o ka heiau i mea e maliu mai ai ke ’kua.","Here are the values of the coconut: its fruit is very palatable; it is made into sweet potato pudding, taro pudding or starch pudding. That was the way the old people used it. It was, however, kapu; only men could eat it. Coconuts were also offered in temples so that the gods might be propitiated."
"O kekahi waiwai ua hana ia kona iwi i umeke ai na na ’lii, a he apuawa kekahi. O ia iho la ka waiwai nui o keia laau. Aole no wau i makaukau no keia kumu manao.

Sema.","Another benefit was: its shell when made into calabashes for the chiefs, as also awa cups. These are the principal values of this tree. I am not proficient on this subject. There is much difficulty attending the search for its origin, and this is what I have ascertained. If any person knows anything further, he had better reveal it to the public. Sema."

There is only one way by which a stranger can walk around that banana field, by putting up marks. There must be four marks; then you who wish to encircle the field should start from one end. When walking do not cast your eyes to this side or that side; keep walking straight ahead, then you can completely encompass it; that is the way with this banana field; he who does not follow instructions can not walk all around it."

The owner of this banana field is the one mentioned above, that is Kahuoi. This man came from Hawaii, and he left there because he could not agree with his parents, Kauahua and Heana. Kauahua was the father and Heana was the mother. Why he did not agree with his parents was because this boy was lazy and would not do any cultivating. The father continually urged the child to go to work, but he would not heed any instructions the father gave him; therefore the father concluded to send his son away from home. When the son was sent away he went down to the beach and saw a canoe ready for departure. He asked the man on the canoe: “Where is the canoe going?” Kilua answered: “The canoe is going to Maui.” Kahuoi said: “Please allow me to go with you?” The man consented. They sailed until they came to the observation point of land for ulua. Alau is the name of this point. On their arrival there, Kahuoi asked Kilua: “Say, how is the canoe to be headed?” Kilua answered: “Head the canoe for Hamoa.” Kahuoi changed to the [ ] bailing place and Kilua took up the paddle. While they were paddling along, a large wave sprang up behind them, and Kahuoi called out to Kilua: “Say, Kilua, keep the canoe on the crest,” and they raced along until they arrived in the harbor above mentioned. Kahuoi then went and lived at Keakamanu; and because he could not get enough to eat he kept wandering on until he found a favorable place, right above Waiohonu; while living there it entered his mind to plant bananas for himself, because he had noticed bananas growing about, and that is the banana field which we are hearing of."

After he had planted the field, and noticed that the banana trees were growing well, he built himself a house. The house he built was of banana leaves. He also planted sugar-cane, taro and various other things."

He walked from one end of the field to the other. While going about he noticed a man plucking his bananas, so he said to him: “So Kinikuapuu is the one to eat of the banana field of Kahuoi!” Kinikuapuu answered: “True, I am eating of your banana field; the rising of the sun warms Ieiea [and] Poopalu, the fishermen of Makalii.” This man Kinikuapuu came from Kauai. He came with these fishermen and landed at Oahu, and from Oahu to Maui, landing at Kaupo. When he came from Kaupo, he arrived at this place above mentioned. While they lived at this place they were great friends; there was plenty to eat; bananas, of course."

The children, the men and the women were in great need. The famine had even reached as far as the konohiki’s place of residence, and the konohiki was also in distress on account of the famine. After that a widow had an idea to go and search for food for them. She said to the parents of her husband: “I am going to search for some mountain kalo for food for us; do you prepare the wood. You wait for me, and if the day passes by without my return, then you may conclude that I am dead.” She then started off to look for wild kalo. She followed the course of a stream. While going towards the mountain not a kalo could she find. It was already picked by those who had gone [ ] before. She kept on until she came to the tall woods when she found some mountain kalo. Others who had sought for food had not gone as far as this. She gathered enough for a large pile which she bundled conveniently for carrying. Then she kept going mountainwards, following the stream. She saw cane stretching out on the ground and then rising again, and bananas till they were over-ripe. She hastened to break some cane and to get some bananas, thinking to take home a bundle of sugar-cane. Kahuoi heard the cane snapping and the noise of the banana trees as they were thrown down. So he went along to see what it was, and saw this beautiful woman. When the woman saw the man, she was afraid, and said to him: “If this banana field and this cane are yours, I beseech for pardon before you for my wrong.” Kahuoi answered and said: “Why should it be wrong to take of the eatables? One must indeed be famished to search the source of food.” And because he was kindly disposed, the woman said: “Perhaps you have a wife?” He answered: “I have no wife; I came alone from my country. My parents were tired of me because I would not do any cultivating, therefore I was sent away, and I found this place and lived here, and now I have met you.” Then the woman said: “Will you then be a husband to me, and let me be your wife? Because I lost my husband a few weeks ago.” Then they lived as husband and wife."

These children were named after the father, not after the mother. While they lived there, the children grew big. The parents went to their cultivating, while the children went to the stream to dig ditches. While so digging, the sister’s ditch was broken prematurely, and she was carried along by the water without the brother’s knowledge. While the brother was digging away at his ditch he happened to glance around and the sister was nowhere in sight, so he started to hunt for her, thinking he could find her quickly. He saw her at Paliakoae, so he chased after her. When he arrived there she had got to Waiailio, and thus he followed after her until she was finally carried out into the ocean. At that time she threw her ivory necklace upon the beach at a place known as Waioaoaku, and it is so named unto this day. The brother was also carried right along, and when he came to this place he saw the necklace of his sister there, so he threw his loin-cloth, Puakai, and it landed by the ivory necklace of his sister. They were taken by the current until the sister was landed at Honuaula, Maui. The brother landed at Puuloa, [Oahu]. The brother married Halawa, while the sister married Kahimanini, who belonged here on Maui. [ ]"

She hunted here and there in the banana field, but couldn’t find them. Then she raised her voice in wailing at the loss of their children, and chanted this chant:"
"Aloha ka wai alelo nui o ka aina, Hu-ai ka paena a ka wai i Kuikuikee Iho mahele lua ka wai i ke alo o ka pali, Ke ku-i kea ka wai i Kauamanu, a pela aku.","Beloved is the great noisy water of the country, Swirling along as it strikes Kukuikee ; Divided is the water as it descends the face of the cliff, Pounding and foaming is the water at Kauamanu, etc."

In the eastern portion of this field of bananas stands a large stone, and it is called Pohakuhaele. This stone was called by that name because of the wanderings of the person referred to above. Piikea brought it from Hawaii and left it there, and it is there today. In the northern portion of the banana field are the canes of Piimaiwaa. They are there to this day. The banana plants from this field were planted in many other places, some of them on Hawaii, but I do not know their story. Some of them on Oahu, some on Kauai, and that is the curly banana of Kaualehu; but the explanations concerning these fields and persons I know not. I have given the story of the field of bananas as it has been told me by older people. Another thing: it is thought that this banana was brought from Kahiki by Ahuimaiaapakanaloa, one of the brothers of Pele. That is perhaps where Kahuoi got his banana, and yet again it may have been his own. D. K. Kanakea."

This is the adze of the olden time, before the days of our grandparents. It must be prepared skilfully, and [ ] great patience must be exercised in its making. To prepare it, it must be rubbed against something else until it is flat and smooth. The face of the adze must be tied up as the white man’s plane is fixed."
"O ka laau kekahi mea nui aole ma ke pono laau, e nana i laau kekee ma kekahi welau e kupono ana i ke koi pahoa, e maihi i ka ili apau o waho, a koe iho ka iho o loko; alaila kalai a maikai a palahalaha pono e kupono ana i ka pohaku me ka hoohalike aku o ka hana ana o ua laau la me ke kii o ke koi.

Peel off the bark, leaving the wood. Then shape it nicely and flat enough to fit the stone, care being taken to try it on the stone often to get a good fit. When the wood fits the stone, the work is done."

The length of the twines should be about two fathoms; and with one of these twines must the adze be tied on to the handle. There is much not obtained, but what I have learned I am giving you. G. H. D. Kalua."

"Ua olelo ia no Kahiki mai keia laau, na Oilikukaheana i lawe mai he mau laau lawaia keia nana.

He brought it for fishing plant. When he came and landed at Kauai, he saw a beautiful woman, Kamaile; she became his wife, and the plants were cared for by her. Afterwards she threw them away and they grew at Waialeale. Some were pulled up by Moikeha and brought by him from Kauai; and without his knowing the kinds of plants they were, he planted them at Halawa, on Oahu. When Moikeha saw that the plants grew he went and told the owner of them, Oilikukaheana, who said the name was Paholei. Moikeha waited until the plants grew large, and because he had forgotten the name, he went to Ewa. This was the time when Ewa and Halawa were living separately; Halawa was not available to every one, hence the saying: “Halawa is not to be seen; ’tis a land at the end of Ewa,” etc."

So he went for some, and found that the roots had grown large. So he pulled up the plants, roots [ ] and leaves, and brought them to Ewa. Ewa said: “Let me first eat of this plant, and should I die, do not plant it, for it would be valueless; but should I not die, then we will be rich.” When Ewa ate it she became drunk and was intoxicated all day. When she awoke she called the plant “ awa ”; from thence forward this plant was called awa, the awa of Kaumakaeha, the chief. There are many other places mentioned as to where awa came from. It is said that birds brought it and planted it in the forests of Puna, Hawaii. Others say that a son of Hiilei brought it. But this is what I have been told by friends as to the origin of the awa."
"Ua olelo ia o kona wahi e ulu ai oia ka aka, oia hoi ka lala, aia a kakiwi ia a kaomi ia me ka pohaku, a kolo ke a-a, alaila lawe e kanu i kau wahi e makemake ai, a o kekahi i ka wa e ka ia ai ka awa oia hoi ka uhuki ana, poke ae no i ka lala a hoolei iho iloko o ka lua o ka puawa i huhuki ia ae ai, a kanu apaa, a omaka ae, ua kapaia ua omaka he nihopuaa, alaila lawe e kanu.

Again, when the awa roots are being dug up, that is, when it is pulled, the branches are chopped up and thrown back into the holes from which the roots have been taken, then covered over with soil, and when the sprouts appear, called Nihopuaa, they are taken and planted. The method of planting that I have seen is the same as that followed in the planting of cane."

Makole! Akahi hele i kai o Piheka, heaha ka ai e ai ai, he awa.”","Awa was a valuable article in the olden time; a great deal of it was bought by the people for drinking and for medicinal purposes. This is what is done if for a sick person: it is used as a medicine together with a black pig for its accompaniment. Awa is chewed and placed in a container, and when there is sufficient it is mixed and strained and poured into the cups; then the priest prays to the guardian spirit, sprinkling some awa for them. Then drink of the awa, and eat of the fat pig. This will cause one to see things hazily at night, and to sleep heavily during the day. So it is with those who are possessed by the gods. When the god comes on a visit and sits on one, awa is quickly gotten ready for the deity; it is hastily chewed, prepared and drank up. And every time the god visits the same process is gone through until one gets inflamed; and when you see some one blear-eyed it reminds you of the following saying: “Inflamed! Inflamed! First go down to Piheka. What food will you have to eat? Awa.”"
"Pela no hoi, ina ua hewa oe i kou akua me kahi huluhulu awa e kala ai i ka hewa, [ ] alaila na ka huhu o ke akua, pela no hoi ina he komo hale aole e haule kahi huluhulu awa, hele ia a me he kanaka ala i hamo ia owaho o ka ili i ka poi ka hele a nakakaka, ka ka poe inu awa mea makemake loa ihola ia, i hele ia a: “Hapala ke ke-a, na ka ele ka ai.”","Again, if you have sinned against your guardian spirit, with the root of the [ ] awa you could be forgiven; then the anger of the guardian spirit would be appeased. If you have a house to move into do not forget the awa root. The awa drinkers desired their skin to be rough just as if they had been daubed over with poi and it had dried; it then becomes: “Stained is the white, the dark (black) has won.”"
"A o kekahi; ina ua hoohiki kekahi me kekahi aole laua e ike, aia a makemake laua e ike, me ka puawa alaila ike, ame ke kahi mau mea e ae no, me kahi huluhulu awa no e pono ai.

There are other things where awa root is needed and used. Another thing, it is not proper to eat food before drinking the awa; drink the awa first, then eat the food; then one becomes intoxicated."
"O ka puawa nohoi kekahi mea waiwai e kuai ia nei ma ko kakou aupuni nei. Nana aku oe o ka oiliili mau no ia o na wahi hapaha, i kela ahiahi keia ahiahi, i loaa ka mea hoomoemoe o ka po.","Awa root is one of the valuable things sold in our kingdom. You can see the quarters disappearing frequently evening after evening, to secure that which would cause profound sleep at night."
"O ka lau he palahalaha nunui, ane like no me kekahi mau laau e ae, eia ka waiwai o ua lau nei; aia a hiki i ka wa mai, haliilii ia ka lau malalo alaila moe iho maluna, he ola no i na no o ka mai kupono ia laau.","The leaves are large and flat, somewhat like those of other plants. Here is the value: when one is sick, spread the leaves underneath and lay the patient on them, and the illness will disappear, provided it is such as can be cured by that medicine."

Another famous place is Hakipuu, Oahu, at a place called Hena; there is located a stone awa container and a stone awa cup. A man named Kapuna went there and drank some awa; and when he came home he was drunk and went to sleep, and died from the intoxication of the awa; and where he died there appeared two ridges; the ridges were joined at some place; those were the legs; there is also a small hill at the place; that was the head of the man. That place is known as Kapuna; this place is mauka of Hakipuu, Oahu. This place is also called Hena, where the awa is noted for its intoxicating quality."

This is how it is done: when a man desires to go up to build a canoe he must first prepare a pig, red fish, black fish and various other things. And when these things are ready he comes home and courts dreams in his sleep. If they are good he will go up, but if they are unfavorable he will not."
"I ka pii ana aole e pii pu me kekahi wahine o hewa. Ina e pii pu ka wahine e naha ana ka waa.

Should a woman go along, the canoe would be cracked. Arriving at the place where [ ] the koa selected for hewing into a canoe stands, a fire is kindled in the imu for the things already prepared. When the fire is kindled a man gets a chip of the koa and burns it in the imu; when all the things are cooked prayers are offered to the canoe-building gods: to Kupulupulu, Kumokuhalii, Kuolonowao, Kupepeiaoloa, Kuhooholopali, Kupaaikee, Kanealuka, and various others; then would he eat of some of these things and throw some away for the gods. And when all these things have been attended to, the tree is ready to be cut."

It would take one man almost a week to fell a tree; if many hands at work it could be felled in two days. Nowadays we have iron axes, and because of their sharpness a tree can easily be cut down. A strong man can cut down a koa tree in half an hour. When the tree is felled some more prayers are offered to the gods before shaping it into a canoe. After shaping it up and making it light it is hauled down and placed inside of a place prepared for it. After three months or more, the finishing touches are put on and the other parts attached."
"Penei e kapili ai: O ka laau e kapili ai he ahakea; eha kupe elua moo, a eia ka inoa o na maha o ka laau e kalai ai. 1, maha kiapuapu; 2, maha hoonolunolu; 3, maha oio; 4, maha unu, e like me ka maha o ka waa, pela no ka maha o ka laau i hana ia ai.

These are the names of the rims to be hewn from the wood: kiapuapu rim, hoonolunolu rim, oio rim and unu rim. These rims are hewn so as to conform to the rim of the canoe. These pieces are tied on to the canoe with the aha or sennit. When the canoe is finished then perform the ceremony known as lolo with a pig. Should it be performed without any interruption then it is a solid canoe, but should the ceremony be interrupted the canoe is not solid, or else trouble would come to the owner of the canoe. After this shape and tie on the outrigger—the ama and the iako —the knees and the covering boards."

This occupation is a hazardous one, often resulting in death. I worked at it from the time I was twelve years of age. It is, however, a profitable industry if one should persevere in following it; because a canoe log four fathoms or more, even though not completed as a canoe, could sell for $40.00. If completed it would bring $80.00 for some, and more for others. Koakanu."

If they do not have a favorable [ ] dream they should not go up. Here is another important thing: on going up and reaching the forest, if they should hear the the alala (Hawaiian crow), the idea of building the canoe [from that particular log] should be abandoned, because it is evident to them that the tree is rotten inside. If they do not hear any noise from birds until they come to the canoe tree, those priests would feel very glad."

If it is intended for sale, another prayer is used at its felling. There are also separate divisions in the prayer for cutting off the branches, the trunk, for shaping it, for hauling it down to the beach, for the construction and for launching it into the sea. The only trouble is I do not know them. Kauwenaole ."

I think it is one of the plants brought from far-off Kahiki; it grows plentifully in our mountains. It grows amongst forest trees, shrubs and other creeping vines. It runs and entwines in shady places with other fragrant plants of the upper regions of our mountain forests."

Some places show only scant growth; at other places it is plentiful. It does not grow in dry places, on rocky lands, on plains, or at the sea beach. But only far up in the mountains where the fog settles all the time in the wilderness."

Here are also some of the famous places where they grow. 1. The maile ku honua (stands on earth). The maile ku honua grows in all the places I have mentioned above; it is a creeping vine. But I wish to tell you of what I know at my place, because when I asked my friends, they had a different explanation about the maile ku honua on the mountains of the different islands of our group. This maile has leaves somewhat round, though some are long, but not very small and slender like the mailelaulii, but more like the orange leaves. In the forests of my place, when the maile first comes up, it has one stem and one branch; the branch, slender and young, [ ] is from a yard to a fathom in length, and this is covered with green, fragrant leaves. The bark comes off readily when stripped by the hand of man, leaving only the woody part."

"Ua ulu nui keia ano maile ma na kuahiwi o Kanoenoe i ka uka o Halelena, a me ke kumu o na pali o Haupu, mauna Kilohana, o oia pu no kekahi o na laau hihi o ka nahele o Alakai, i haku ia ma ke mele, ma Kauai:","This kind of maile grows plentifully in the mountains of Kanoenoe, above Halelena, on top of the hills of Haupu, on Kilohana Mountain; and it is one of the creeping vines of the wilds of Alakai, Kauai, and is mentioned in the following song:"

This was during the time we were at the Ehukai. (Waialua is often referred to as the Ehukai of Puaena. )"

This maile does not grow abundantly in some places, and does not grow at all in other parts of our mountains. This also is a creeping maile, somewhat different from the maile ku honua; this has narrow leaves like the bambu, small and somewhat like the leaves of the willow, or something like the leaves of a young koa tree; it grows profusely at Koiahi, the mountains of Waianae, Oahu, hence the expression, “the small-leaved maile of Koiahi.” This maile is famous to the people from Hawaii and Kauai. It also grows at the pali of Nuuanu. I have seen maile there resembling this small-leaved maile. Some grow at Kauai, though not exactly as fine-leaved as this, but because it does not grow profusely there, the natives of the place call it the small-leaved maile. This is found on the eastern side of the precipice of Haupu in line with the water (spring) of Kemamo and the curly bananas of Kanalehua."
"Ua makemake nui ia ka maile e na kanaka o Hawaii nei, ke manao nei au he mea mau no paha ia mai na kupuna mai, aole paha? Ua lawe nui ia ka maile no na ahaaina nui, i mea hoouliuli a hoowehiwehi.

Maile is used a great deal during feasts, for greens and for decorative purposes. The place is generally decorated with the greens of the mountains; the inside as well as the outside is skilfully decorated; the living house is also decorated; greens are secured for decorations for the inside to make it attractive; maile is used for leis for the people; for men, women and children; for the chiefs, the noted people, and the rich people; for the farmer, the oppressed, the branded servant. The people of Hawaii nei were very fond of this deep green leaf of the [ ] forest because of its fragrance. And because it was so very much desired by the people, therefore it was greatly used in the composition of songs, hulas, chants, dirges, and various other compositions."
"A mamuli no o ka maile i kapaia ai na inoa o na kaikuahine ala o Aiwohikupua, kekahi keiki alii o Kauai.

These were the names: Mailehaiwale, Mailekaluhea, Mailelaulii and Mailepakaha. Some of the famous places also of that island were named after the maile: “the leaping fire of Kamaile,” because maile grew abundantly on those mountain ranges from Nualolo to the precipices of Kalalau, and even unto the valley of the dwarf oopus, Hanakapiai, overlooking the fire-hurling precipice of Makena, where Haena inhales the wind. This is the one plant familiar to these mountains, the maile."
"A he mau maile e ae no kekahi, he mau maile haole nae, aole i loaa ia’u ka inoa, oia kela laau e ulu ana ma ka puka pa o Mr. Bishop, a ua ulu no kekahi ano maile ma ke kula ma ka nahelehele, he maile heu, i na e ai ae i ka ia he palani a me ka maikoiko, o ka mea ia e pau ai ka hohono, e lomi ai i ka lau, ua hoomanao paha oukou i keia, aia no e ulu nei ma na kula.","There are other kinds of maile, but they are foreign mailes. I do not know their names. There is one plant by Mr. Bishop’s gate. Some kinds of maile also grow on the plains in weeds; it has fine hair. When preparing the fishes known as palani and maikoiko , this plant is used to do away with the strong smell, rubbing its leaves in among the fish. Perhaps you know about this. This plant still grows on the plains."

It is not like other trees which are growing now. This is what I have gathered from inquiries of friends. They state that this tree is indigenous to Hawaii nei, but I do not know of the place where it first grew. This tree is rough in its kind. We have therefore the basis."

That is not all: it is also used as firewood for cooking food by some people. This tree grows plentifully on hills and valleys surrounding us. It is used by children for play boats, also by men; it is also used by some to mend looking glasses. When a glass is broken a piece of wiliwili wood is taken and shaped so that the broken piece of looking glass is fitted in."

But it must not be finished into a canoe while it is green; leave it for finishing till it is seasoned, then use it. The outrigger float is made like the wiliwili canoe. When the time comes that the fish auau moves in schools, the owner of this wiliwili canoe would go out, followed by others in other kinds of canoes; and when they have caught the fish, they would return, and the man in the wiliwili canoe would divide the fish. That is not all: it is made by some people into tinder to continue the fire, and is used by others for purposes of smoking. This is what I have found out through inquiring among friends. They have told me what they knew, and with what I know has increased it somewhat; perhaps there are many other things, but I do not know what they are. This is all I have found. W. J. Kahopukahi."

Its trunk is soft when it is cut, and its bark is insipid to the taste, though it is used as food in times of distress from hunger up in the mountains. This wood is used in the construction of large and small houses, though it quickly rots; it is used for fence posts, and for guiding rods for the ends of fishing nets. Its flowers are of two kinds, white flower and red. Such are the characteristics of this tree."
"He wahine maikai keia, mamuli o ke kapa ia ana o ka inoa o keia ohia puakea no kekahi kaikamahine maikai, oia hoi, o Waiakea, no kona noho paa ana malaila, a hiki i kona wa i lauhine ai, ia wa, hoopuka mai ia i kana huaolelo penei: “E Aulii e,” kahea mai o Aulii, “Eia no au.” “E kii oe i kuu hua ohelo aia ia Kealia (ma Oahu) a e lawe mai oe.

Should he ask you, ‘What do you want here?’ then say to him, ‘I came to get the ohelo fruits of your daughter Waiakea, for she is very fond of them.’ ” Then those fruits were given. And when Aulii returned and arrived at the house of Waiakea, she asked: “Where are the fruits?” “Here they are!” answered Aulii, and when Waiakea looked she realized that they were not what she wanted; then the fruits were called “puakea”; this tree has white flowers, and its fruit is also white when it is ripe; it is palatable when eaten. It has [ ] one round seed split in two parts; the birds are fond of the nectar of its flowers. The bird snarers used the branches on which the flowers were thick to put their gum on, and when a bird was caught the snarer would call out, “Snared, snared is my bird,” etc. The bird must be secured as quickly as possible. Its trunk, as also its branches, is used for firewood."

The cause of the origin of this ohia was through Puaena and Ukoa. At the time they were living as husband and wife, they had a child called Laka, named after a man Kukaohialaka. After a while it occurred to Laka to go and visit his female cousin, Waiakea; and when he was ready to go, Ukoa said to him: “You are now going to see your cousin, and you will henceforth be called Kukaohialaka.” That is why this ohia is called “ohia ula,” because this child was red, and because this child was also called a red ohia (Kukaohiaula). Its value is like that stated for the ohia puakea."

This ohia was named thus because of the anger of Poopapale; because Akahi’s (a bird’s) nest with its eggs were continually falling down. Poopapale conceived the idea of breaking off the branches (of the ohia tree) until they came to naught. But when he commenced to break them, Kalehua (the lehua) cried out on account of great pain; then Poopapale said to Kalehua: “Behold here you are a person, and yet you have been constantly harassing me!” Then Kalehua spoke up: “Let me live.” Poopapale replied: “Of what benefit will it be to me to let you live?” Kalehua answered Poopapale and said: “If you will spare me you will be benefited.” Poopapale asked: “What benefit?” “I have food and water. Should you go visiting and you get into trouble, let me furnish the food and water; thus you and your friends would be revived to continue your journey.” Thus came the name of this lehua, from Kalehua, a beautiful woman. I do not know her parents; that is the story I have gathered. This tree is also used by children for snaring birds. The full name of Poopapale was O’upoopapale."

The wood is hard like the aalii ; it can resist the strong wind. That is all that I have gathered about this wood.

The place of its possible origin I do not know, but I surmise it is from some people. That is, however, the characteristic of this tree."

Perhaps it is so, according to the ancient history of Hawaii nei; but there are some who say that these trees came by the mouth of Ukeke; a bird which came from Kahiki bringing them here to Hawaii. The bird, however, belonged to Hawaii nei. Some say that these trees were obtained by Koea from the throat of Waia; this tree, however, was hidden by Waia in his throat, but because Koea was provoked on account of the continual breaking of the wood that he would get, he turned to Kawau the oldest man and said: “Say, what are the oldest trees that you know of from your youth to your old age?” Kawau answered: “There is still a tree, but you can not get it, because Waia is a strong man though somewhat secretive.” “And how can it be obtained?” asked Koea. “Here is how you may get it: should you go and he should ask you, then you reply, ‘I came to get me some wood;’ that is how you must answer.” Koea went until he came into the presence of Waia, and Waia asked, “Why are you here?” Koea answered, “I came to get my wood, because I began to cut down all the other wood, but they do not last; so I asked Kawau, and he directed me to you, and that is why I came to you.” Waia said, “There is some wood if you will consent to my desire.” Koea answered, “I consent.” Waia then said to him, “Hold my throat. After you have held it for some time, should some women appear, catch hold of them and you will be benefited. If I should die, do you take care of my throat.” So he went and held fast to the throat of Waia for quite a while. The women appeared, so he grabbed them and held them fast; he also at the same time still held the throat of Waia. That was one of the methods of securing this plant: from the throat of Waia. I do not know of anything further. This is all I have learned from some of my friends. W. B. Kaupena. [ ]"

Those are the names given by Mauiites to mats. The Hawaii people have names somewhat similar to those of Maui, except in some cases they are different. These are the names: pawehe , lauhala , makalii , pueo , launui , ne-ki , makoloa . What I know about the Oahu mats, they are like those of Hawaii. Kauai’s mats are named like those of Maui.

"O ka hana ana o ka moena makalii, aole e pono i ka lauhala o-o, o ulaula ka moena a he inoino no hoi; aia wale no ka pono he lauhala muo, a opiopio no hoi, alaila, ooki ia lalo kahi e pili ana i ke kumu, alaila, hoi mai. Ho-a ka imu, a olani i keia lau hala opiopio me ka moa maikai, kau-lai aku i ka la, a maloo, pokaa aku e like me ka makemake o mea nana e hana.","When preparing for the makalii mat the ripe lauhala is not used, for then the mat would be red and coarse; the leaf shoot of the lauhala must be used, the very tender part. The leaves are cut near where it joins the trunk, and are brought home. A fire is lighted and these young leaves are held over the fire until they are evenly wilted, when they are dried in the sun until fit. Then they are rolled up in bundles according to the taste of the worker preparing the same."
"He pono lauhala no, ina no he lauhala o-o, a he lauhala opiopio, aia no i ka mea e loaa ana, o ka lauhala nae kona mea hana. O ka ne-ki, he akaakai ia. Aia a o ke akaakai opiopio ka mea e hana ia ai, no ka mea, ina he akaakai o-o he paapaaina, a [ ] i ole ia, he ula i ka nana iho. O ka makoloa hoi, hele no hoi e oki i ka makoloa nui, a i ole ia, he uhuki mai no.","Any kind of lauhala is used for this mat; ripe lauhala or young lauhala may be used; any kind that can be secured so long as it is lauhala, for that is what it is made of. The ne-ki is made of the bulrush. But it must be the young rush, because [ ] if it is matured it would be brittle and become reddish in appearance. For the makoloa mat, a lot of makoloa rush is cut or pulled up and dried."
"Penei ka ulana ana o ka moena makalii; ki-hae a liilii e like me ka manao o ka mea nana ia e hana ana, alaila, ulana iluna o ka papa. O ka’u mea no nae keia i ike, a paa no hoi.

This is what I have seen as I remember it. The makoloa mat is braided, but not on a board. When you lie on it, it is smooth. I know nothing about the lauhala mat. The akaakai (rush) mat is braided like the lauhala. It is cold when you first lie on it; it takes some time to warm it up. The alolua mat: in the braiding of this two lauhala strands are placed back to back and are braided in that way. Any kind of lauhala would do for this, old lauhala or young lauhala. The puahala mat has a foundation like the flower of the hala (pandanus) when cut; it has serrated edges. Any kind of lauhala will do. I know nothing about the makanui mat. The pakea mat: I am a little doubtful about this mat, but this is the explanation offered by some: the pakea mat is a mat made of the midrib of the lauhala; after the leafy parts are separated from it, this part is taken and braided into a mat. Some say that it is a makoloa mat, and is the whitest mat, not a spot either red or black or other color could be seen on it. The pueo mat is a mat which has large braids. I have not seen that mat. I have not seen the launui mat, either, nor the hiialo mat. It is said that the kumukolu has three layers at the starting point, and the kumulua has two; but I do not know what is meant by that. The palau is an old and worn mat, generally small, used for sitting by fireplaces, and used on the veranda outside or inside the doorway. The palau and the aneenee are the same thing. The pawehe mat is a makoloa mat. I do not know how it is made; no explanation has been given."

Puna is noted for the makalii mat (small-stranded); that land is also noted for the fact that it is permeated with the fragrance of the hinano ; that is what caused Hawaii to be famous. Maui is noted for the puahala mat, so let us not seriously consider Maui. What mat Molokai is famous for I do not know. It is only noted for ku’i laau : “Canoe-poling Molokai, long may you live!” Oahu’s famous mat I do not know either; Oahu is famous for being the center of the seas: “Excelling is Oahu, long may you live!” Kauai’s famous mat is mixed up with Niihau’s: “Broad-chested Kauai, long may you live!”"

Aka, i hookahi a kakou mea e huli ai a nana iho o ka waiwai o ka laau.","Because I do not know where the koa tree came from, therefore I can not explain fully the cause of its being received here in Hawaii; perhaps it was brought from a foreign country, or maybe it is indigenous to Hawaii. But let us investigate and examine one thing: the value of the wood."
"He laau waiwai ke koa ke makemake ke kanaka e imi i waiwai nona ma ka hana ana i ka wahie a penei e hana’i: E kua a nui; poke a poepoe i hookahi anana ka loa o ka pauku, a kukulu paila, i hookahi anana ke kiekie, hookahi anana ka laula, hoopiha a piha pono.

When there are one hundred piles made, sell them to those who desire firewood, at [the rate of] eight dollars ($8.00) per pile. That is one value. Here are some of its uses: yoke for oxen, poi boards, boards for houses, posts for houses, shingles, coffins, trunks, and doors. Out of koa lumber good trunks and coffins and doors are made. Out of koa lumber also are made excellent bedsteads called koa bedsteads. These bedsteads cost a great deal of money."

O ka hohonu o na waa liilii ua like no me ke ano e ike ia nei i keia wa.","During the period when Hawaii was unenlightened, the people had already acquired the art of constructing canoes. They were able to construct canoes which reached ten fathoms, more or less, in length, and smaller canoes which reached from four to six fathoms in length. In depth, some of these canoes reached the armpit of a person when he stood inside of one of them. However, a common man was seldom seen in one of these large canoes, they were mostly used by the chiefs in the olden times. The depth of the smaller canoes is like that we see nowadays."
"No ke koi: O ke koi e kalai ai i na waa ia manawa, he mau koi pahoa, aole ike nui ia i keia manawa. He ano okoa no ia mau pohaku, he mau pohaku paakiki, oia na koi e oki ai a hina ilalo, ame ke kalai ana ia loko, aole he koi maoli ia manawa.","Concerning the adze: The adzes used for hewing canoes those days were of hard stone, seldom seen nowadays. These stones are different [from common stones]; they were hard stones. Those were the adzes used for cutting down the trees and hewing the inside; there were no regular axes those days."
"O ka pii ana o ke kahuna kalai waa a hiki i kahi o ka laau i makemakeia i waa, nana mua aku i ka lala kamahele, a ma kahi e ku ai o ka lala kamahele, malaila e hina ai ka laau; ina e hina a ili iluna o kekahi laau okoa, aole pono, ina e hina ma kahi kaawale ua maikai ia. [ ]","When the canoe-building priest goes up and comes to the tree desired for a canoe, he looks first at the main branch, and where the main branch extends, towards that side is the tree to be felled. If the tree, in falling, lands on another tree, the omen is bad [it is not right]; if it falls clear, it is good. [ ]"
"I ka hina ana o ka laau ilalo, lele mai ka manu elepaio, oia ke akua o ka poe kalai waa, a kau iluna o ka laau; ina e holoholo ka manu mai mua a hiki i hope, aole kiko mao a maanei o ka laau a lele aku, he waa maikai ia; ina e kiko ma ka aoao hookahi mai mua a hiki i hope, o ka waha no ia o ka waa e kalai ai. Ina e kiko mai mua a hiki i hope ma kela aoao keia aoao, he waa puha ia, pono ke haalele. O ke oki ana i ka welau, he pule ko ia mea; aole hoi i loaa.","After the tree is felled, the elepaio bird, the god of the canoe builders, flies and alights on the tree. If the bird runs back and forth, without pecking here and there of the tree, and then flies away, it is a good canoe. If it peck along one side from the front to the back, then hew that side for the mouth of the canoe. If it peck on that side and this side [on both sides] it indicates a rotten canoe; better leave it alone. In cutting off the top there is a prayer for it, but I have not obtained it."
"I ke kalai ana o ka waa, owaho mua, a pau owaho, alaila, kalai aku oloko. Oia kalai ana nae, aole hooponopono ia, he pono no i ke kupa aia ka pono o ka mama i kauo i kai.

O ka hana a na pepeiao, he wahi e paa’i ka iako, ke kia, ame ka papa noho ana o ke kanaka.","In hewing a canoe the outside is hewn first, and when the outside is finished, then work on the inside. At this time, however, no particular way of hewing is observed; any way of dieting out is allowed, so that the canoe may be lightened for dragging down to the beach. The canoe is nicely tapered in the front, and is large and full in the rear. Some projections are left in the canoe; as many as four, five or perhaps six, according to the wishes of the priest and the size of the canoe. These projections are used for parts to which are fastened the outrigger, the mast, and on which are placed the seats."
"A pau i ke kalai, alaila, hoi aku ke kahuna kalai waa a ka mea nona ka waa hai aku ua pau ka waa i ke kalai ia. Ina e manao ana ka mea nona ka waa e pii e nana, alaila pii pu me ke kahuna; ina aole e pii, waiho no ka waa pela a maloo, alaila kii e kauo mai i kai.","When this hewing is done, then the canoe-building priest reports to the owner that the work is completed. If the owner wishes to go up and view the canoe, then he accompanies the priest; if he does not so wish, the canoe is left alone until it is seasoned, when it is hauled down to the shore."
"O ke kauo ana, he hana nui no ia. Aole e hiki ke uuku kanaka; aia no a nui, a kanaha paha, kanaono, kanawalu. Elike me ka nui o ka waa pela ka nui o kanaka, ina uuku ka waa uuku no kanaka.

O ka ai, o ka puaa, ka moa, ka palahu, ka ia maoli, a ku aku i uka elike me ka lawa kupono no ka lehulehu.","Dragging the canoe is another important work. It can not be done if men are few; there must be many, perhaps forty, sixty or eighty. According to the size of the canoe so will be the number of men required; a small canoe requires fewer men. The day set apart for dragging the canoe is a day of much pomp; like the day of the funeral of a famous man, so is the day for dragging the canoe, for there will go up men, women, children, and sometimes chiefs. Food, pigs, chickens, turkeys and fish enough to feed the multitude are taken up."
"A hiki aku la kanaka i kahi o ka waa i waiho ai, alaila, liuliu a hoomakaukau no ke kauo ana.

A rope is tied to the crease prepared for it, and when that is ready then the procession is set from where the rope is tied to the canoe crease to the end of the rope far ahead. Strong men are placed at the end of the rope, so that the rope would be kept taut when being pulled, and would not slacken, tangle, and hurt the men when the canoe slides down a precipice."
"I ka wa e kauo ia’i ka waa a hiki i ka pali ano kiekie, kupono ole i ka lehulehu ke huki pu i ka pali, alaila, hoonohonoho ia ka lehulehu o kanaka a wae ia i mau wahi kanaka hapa ka mea nana e huki aku i ka ihona i ka pali, a ilaila kakou e ike ai i ka akamai o ke kanaka pale waa, a ilaila no hoi ia e hoike ai i kona akamai nui i mua o kanaka; a pau ka hooponopono ana, kau iho la ke kanaka nana e hookele i ka waa i [ ] ka pali; a huki aku la ka poe i wae ia, o ka holo aku la no ia a hiki i kahi e ikaika’i ka holo ana pau ka huki ana o kanaka, i ka hookele wale aku no ia wahi. O ka holo ana waa i ka pali, ua hapa ka holo o ka lio.","When the canoe is dragged until it is brought to a moderately steep hill where it is impossible for many to pull together on account of the steepness of the hill, a rearrangement of the people is made, and fewer men are required to pull it down the hill; it is then that we realize the skill of the man who guides the passage of the canoe, and it is then also that he shows his great ability to the people. When the preparations are complete, the man who will steer the canoe down the hill rides it: those [ ] who were selected commence pulling and the canoe moves along until the canoe attains a good speed, when the men who are pulling desist and the canoe director takes charge from then on. A canoe coasting down a hill is faster than a galloping horse."
"Ina he alanui inoino ua hiki no ke hoihoi ma kahi maikai, ina he kumu laau nui mamua, he pohaku paha, a ua kekee paha ke alanui, a manao aku kakou e nahaha ana ka waa aka, i ka holo ana, ua like me ka holo ana i ka pali ili lau mania; nokamea, aia no i ke kanaka ka naha o ka waa a me ka ole.

Ua ike mau au ia mea ma ko’u aina hanau.","If the road be rough, the canoe can be shifted to a smooth place; if a large tree or a stone stand in the way, or the road be crooked, we think the canoe would be broken, yet when it is coasting it is like sliding down a smooth-surfaced hill; because it is the man guiding who wrecks or saves the canoe. Arriving on the flat the multitude drags again, and thus they go until the house is reached. But if it is a half-witted man who directs the canoe, or a man with little ability, this will surely occur: trouble will follow from the outset. I saw this happen continually at my birthplace."
"O kahi e kau ai o ke pale waa mamua ma ka makuu; he wahi pauku kaula pokole kana e paa’i me ka pauku laau i hoopaa ia a paa i ka makuu.

Ina e makemake e kaohi, ua hiki no, me ka hiki ole i ka lehulehu ke huki.","The man who guides the canoe rides in front by the crease; he holds on to a short rope and a small stick made fast to the crease. As the rudder of a ship is used, so is this used. If the canoe swerves from the path selected, this would be used as a lever to head the canoe properly. If it is desired to land the canoe at any chosen place, it can be done. If [the director] wishes to step back into the canoe while it is coasting, it can be done. If he wishes to restrain the canoe so that those who are dragging it are unable to do so, it can be done."

Hence the aha cord is placed across the door, so that a person would come and talk from the outside, and be unable to enter the house. If that person has an important idea the work is stopped and the conversation then held. This is a rule strictly adhered to by some canoe-builders."
"Elua ano o ke kalai ana o ka waa i ka wa e hoomaikai ai, mamua mai, a mahope aku nei. Ina ma ka hema ka hoomaka ana e kalai kekahi aoao, aole ma ke kalai hou mai ma ka akau o inoino.

If the commencement of the hewing of a side be from the left, do not change and work from the right, for it would be defective. If the commencement of the work be from the fore part, continue in that direction until the stern is reached, then quit; do not change the direction of the hewing from the stern. It is the same with the other side, commence hewing from the stern and when the bow is reached, then quit. Do not hew from the bow and the stern of the same side; else there would be a hole in the middle."

The koi kupa is used for digging out the inside and hewing the rough of the outside [of the canoe] when it is thick; and when it is thinned then the koi wili would be used to finish off. The koi wili could be used in hewing at wide and narrow places. When the canoe is finished, the wae are placed in position; these are the parts [ ] on top of the niao worked in with carved pieces [manu]. This is made of another wood, the aiea ; this is the proper wood from which to make the wae . In fastening, the sennit is used to tie these on to the canoe. When that is finished, the iako and the ama [the outrigger] are placed in position; these are for the purpose of steadying the canoe. The proper woods out of which to make these parts are the hau and the wiliwili."
"Ekolu laau e ae i hana ia i waa i ka wa kahiko, o ka wiliwili, ke kukui ame ka ulu. O ka wiliwili nae ka mea hana ia a hiki i keia manawa. O ke kukui aole ike nui ia i keia wa.

The wiliwili is yet being used. The kukui is not much seen at this time. The ulu is used for repairing a broken canoe; great skill is required to do the patching well so as to make it blend together."

That will be the mixture to form the black paint to adhere to the canoe."

A hiki i ka hale, waiho a pulu iloko o ka wai, a hala eono la, a i ole ewalu la, hookahi anahulu no hoi, a elua paha, kii aku a lawe mai.","The following is the way of procuring wauke: before Christianity was brought here, and the goods of the foreigners were obtained, the things which a person used in supplying his needs, he used to get a bambu and split it. Then he would look for good bambu knives, sharp when used for cutting. Or else, he looked for a sharp pahoa stone that could be used for cutting. Then he went up to where the wauke grew and cut it with the stone adze which he made or with the bambu, until he had enough, at the same time stripping them. Because when cutting the lower part, the part near the bottom, it is cut completely around through the bark to the wood; the bark is easily pulled off; this is continued until sufficient has been secured according to one’s desire. Then he stopped cutting. He next trimmed off the outside bark, and when that was done it was sorted in equal lengths and set properly in a pile. When sufficient was piled for a bundle which could be carried on the back it was securely fastened, and one would return home. On reaching the house it [the wauke] was left in the water until soft; after six days, eight days, ten days or perhaps twenty days, it was taken out of the water."
"Iloko o ke kuku ana, eia na mea e hoolako ai: 1. Ke kua e kuku ai. O na laau kupono no kela mea e hana ai; kauila, kawau, ohia, mamane, kela ame keia laau ano like e ae, e kupono ana no ia hana. He kapu no ke kii ana. Ua like ke kii ana i keia mau laau i hai ia aela maluna, me ke kii ana i na o-o, me ka pule aku no i na akua oia hana, ua lohe no kakou ia mea mamua. O ke ano o ke kua, ua hana ia a pakiikii o luna, o na poo a i elua o ke kua, ua hooloihi ia oluna, ua hoopokole ia olalo.","For the process of beating the kapa these things are prepared: 1. The block on which to do the beating; the proper wood from which to obtain this block, kauwila, kawau , ohia , mamane ; those and other woods of a similar nature which are suitable for that purpose. There is a kapu attached to the manner of getting them. The manner of acquiring these trees enumerated above is like that of obtaining the o-o: with prayer offerings to the gods of this industry. We were told that before. This block is made broad and flat on top and the two ends are made thus: the top one is lengthened and the under one is shortened."
"2. O ka i-e. O na laau e hana ai ia mea, o ka ohia, koaie, kawau, a me kekahi mau laau e ae i kupono no ia hana.","2. The i-e (club). The woods from which to obtain this club are the ohia , koaie , kawau and other woods suitable for that purpose."
"3. O ka wai, i mea kapipi i mea e mau ai ka ma-u o ka wauke. O ka i-e mua e kuku ai, o ka i-e pepehi, oia ka i-e maka nunui, a pau ia o ka i-e kike, he i-e makaliilii iho, o ka i-e hoopai aku, ka i-e hooki, alaila oki ke kapa. Lawe aku e komo i ka wai.

Pela e hana mau ai a maloo ka pa-u. A pela no e hana ai a loaa na kapa elima, humu a paa. Kapaia kela he kuina kapa.","3. The water for sprinkling so that the wauke is kept wet continually. The first club to use in beating is the one for hard pounding, a coarse-figured club; after that is the iekike , the dividing club, a smaller-figured club; then comes the printing club and the finishing club. The kapa is then cut. It is next taken to soak in water; on returning it is spread to dry at a place prepared for drying it, that is the drying ground; there it is [spread out] and pressed down with rocks placed here and there so that the pa-u would not wrinkle. This is continued until the pa-u is dry. And this is done until there are five kapa; they are then sewn together. That is called a set of kapa."
"4. Ina e makemake i paiula, alaila, pii i ka hili, oia ka ili o ke kukui; hoi mai kui a wali, waiho a pulu. Alaila, i ka wa e kuku ai i ke kapa a oki ke kapa alaila, hooluu [ ] i ka hili. Kapaia ka inoa oia kapa, he paiula, he kapa aahu nui ia no hoi ia e na ’lii i ka wa kahiko.","4. If paiula is wanted, then some hili is obtained—that is the bark of the kukui. On returning from the mountain it is pounded and is left to soften. When the kapa [ ] has been prepared and is cut it is dyed in the hili. That kapa is called “paiula,” a kapa used a great deal by the chiefs in the olden times."
"5. Ina he palaholo ke kapa, kii mua i ka palaholo. Ua ulu keia mea ma ke kula. Hoi mai, ku’i a wali, alaila houluulu mua i na kapa nahaehae a nui, oia na kapa ano kahiko, ua hele a awelu; alaila, ua hanaia me keia palaholo, alaila i kapa ano maikai ke nana aku. Kapaia keia he palaholo.","5. If the kapa be palaholo , first obtain the palaholo. This thing grows on the plains. On returning pound it. First gather all the torn kapa until plenty is secured, that is, the somewhat old kapa, those which are ragged. These are beaten with the palaholo and a kapa of good appearance is obtained. It is called “palaholo.”"
"6. I na he pala-a ke kapa a ke kanaka e makemake ai, ua kii no ia i ka pala-a mauka o ke kuahiwi, a loaa hoi mai a hana no i keia. O ka manawa mau e hiki ai keia mau manao hoololi ano e o ke kanaka i na kapa, o ka manawa e kuku ai.",6. If pala-a is the kapa desired by a person he would go up to the mountain to get some pala-a; and when he has obtained it return and do like this [as above mentioned]. The proper time in which a person can make these desired changes in the kapa is when he beats out the material.
"7. Ina he kapala ke kapa, ua kui ia ka lanahu a aeae. Alaila, i ka wa e kuku ai, kapala mai no ke kapa i ka wai eleele o ka lanahu. A pela no e hana ai a hiki i ke oki ana o ke kapa; pela no e hana ai a lawa ke kuina kapa. Aka, o ke kaulai ana, ua like no me na kapa mua, no ke kapala ia o keia kapa i ka lanahu, kapaia kona inoa he kapala.","7. If the kapa be kapala , charcoal is pulverized to a powder. Then when being beaten the kapa is painted (daubed) with the black water of the charcoal. This is continued until the kapa is cut, and so on until there is enough for a set. But it is dried like those first kapa. Because this kapa is daubed with charcoal, it is called “kapala.”"
"8. Ina he olena ke kapa, ua kii ia no ka olena a lawa. Ua hanaia a wali, oia hoi, ua kui ia, a o ka wai oia mea, he mea e ho-u ai i ke kapa i ka wa e kuku ai; pela no e hana ai a lawa ke kuina. O keia kapa nae, ua waiho ia i mea hoomanamana i ka moo, ia Kiha ma, me ka olelo ana o ko lakou kapa ka ia.","8. If olena be the kapa then sufficient olena is obtained. It is prepared until soft, that is, pounded, and its juice is what the kapa is wet with when being beaten. Keep on thus until a set is complete. This kapa, however, is set aside for the ownership of the lizard, Kiha, with the statement that the kapa is that god’s."
"9. No ka mamaki. Ua like no ke kii ana i na laau o keia ano me ke kii ana i ka wauke; a pela no ka hana ana, a pela no ke kuku ana; o keia kapa nae, ua makemake nui ia e na ’lii. S. Kaha.","9. Relating to the mamaki. Going after this kind of a plant is like going after the wauke. The method of preparation and making is the same. The kapa, however, is greatly favored by the chiefs. S. Kaha."
"O na hale o ko Hawaii nei, he mau hale no ia i hana ia me na ililaau, nahelehele, lau laau, a me ke ie, o ia hoi, pili, kalamalo, kukaelio, lau la-i a me ka lauhala.

The first thing which the house builder looks for is the place where the house shall stand. The proper places to stand on are nicely elevated spots, plains and favored valleys. Poorly selected grounds are those which are soft or full of holes; and that which was used for papa kahuia . The papa kahuia is the anaana ceremony of the priests in the olden times: those who prayed others to death."
"O ka lua o na mea nui; oia ka imi ana i na pono a pau o ka hale, oia hoi na pou, na o-a, kaupoku, pouhana, na lohelau, aho a me ke kaula, a me ka lauhala a pili paha.

Elua nae ano o na aho e hana ai, oia ka aho nui a me ka aho liilii; o na aho nui, oia na aho moe o ka hale, a o na aho liilii, oia na aho ku, a ua kapa ia he ahu-i.","The second of these great things is the searching for the various parts of the house, i.e., the side posts, the rafters, the ridge-pole, the main posts, the plates, the battens, the sennit, and the lauhala or pili grass. If the house should have five spaces, there are six posts in the back and six in the front. The best wood to use for these posts is the ohia; for the battens, use the opiko , bambu, olomea , kawau , neneleau , [ ] akala , and the haukoii . Prepare two kinds of battens, however; the large as well as the small battens. The large battens are laid horizontally in the house, and the smaller battens are laid vertically and are called ahu-i ."
"O ka rula nui o ka hana ana i ka hale, oia ke ano e ole o na laau, oia hoi i hookahi no ano laau, a hookahi no ano aho. O na kaula, oia ke i-e, kowali a me ka huehue.

The cords are the i-e ( Freycinetia arnotti ), kowali and the huehue ( cocculus ). This i-e and the kowali are prepared by cooking them in the imu, then soaking them in the water until the skin peels off, when they are ready for use; and the huehue, by simply placing it in the sun until half dry."
"O ke kalai ana o na pae pou, e waiho ia olalo o ka pou, aole e kalai ia; a o luna ae e kalai ia; e hana ia nae a oi-oi na poo, me he kui pahupahu la. A o ko na o-a hoi, ua hana ia manalua ke poo a ua kapaia, he mai kane, a he mai wahine. A o ko na lohelau hoi, e kalai palahalaha ia, a o ko na pouhana, e auwaha ia a maluna e like me kona o-a. A o ke kalai ana o na aho, ma ke kumu wale no e kalai ai ma kahi nui.","In hewing the posts the lower part is left natural, not hewn; but the upper part is hewn. The top ends are made tapering like a billiard cue. The rafters have mortises at the ends known as male and female. The plates are hewn flat, and the main posts are notched at the top to fit the rafters. The battens are hewn only at the bottom, the larger end."
"I ke kukulu ana, e pono e eli mua i na lua, e like me ka nui o na pou. I ka eli ana nae, e ka i ka lepo iloko o ka hale, aole hoolei iwaho e like me ko ka lua kupapau. Alaila e kukulu i na pou kihi o ke kua a me ke alo.

E nana pono nae i ole e kiekie a emi kekahi, e pono e kaulike wale no. A paa i ke kukuluia na pae pou alaila kukulu i na pouhana.","In constructing it is well first to dig the holes, as many holes as there are posts. When digging, however, throw the dirt into the house; do not throw it out like the digging of a grave. Then set the corner posts of the back and the front. In placing the posts be sure the line of posts is straight from the back to the front; because if these are not in line the house would be defective; the posts must be correctly placed. Be careful also that one does not stand higher than the other, but are all on the same level. When these posts are set then erect the main posts."
"I ke kukulu ana i na pouhana, e pii na kanaka elua iluna, ma na pouhana elua, a e kau i ke kaupoku; e nana nae a kaulike, alaila puki mai i ano oiki oluna o kaupoku.

First see that it is level; then draw it in (to make the roof small) so that the roof would have a neat appearance. This is done so that the house would not appear topheavy thus giving another expert a chance to ridicule it. But build the house so that it would stand out; and such a house is called by the people a “ hale kukuohi .” When the posts are firmly planted place on them the plates for the two sides, fitting them with the tenon at the top of each post. After the plates are in position place and tie the rafters on both sides; then fasten at the ridge and at the junction of the rafter with the plates and the posts. When this is finished then place the supplementary ridge-pole ( kuaiole ) on top of the rafters, and tie on to the ridge-pole. The end posts are now placed in position, if so desired, or else they can be left till later."
"O ka hoaho ana o na hale o Hawaii nei, ua hoaho ia e like me ke ano o ka hale i manaoia; oia hoi i na he hale lauhala ka hale, ekolu ano hale oia: he pili, he hua moa, [ ] a he wai.

If the house desired be pili, then the battens are placed four fingers apart; if it be wai, then they are two fingers apart; and if huamoa, then they are three fingers apart. These names, however, apply to lauhala houses only, and not to other houses. These houses are so designated according to the lauhala and is understood by one thatching the house."
"I ka hoaho ana nae, e pono e hookaaweleia na aho; oia hoi he aho pueo.

O ka hoaho ana hoi o na hakala, e nakii ia no na aho pueo i na laau ku e ae a koe ka pouhana he laau alii ia, he kapu hoi.","When placing the battens, however, care should be used to separate them; first the larger battens ( aho-pueo ); those are the ones to hold the posts together. Then the free running battens ( aho holowala ); those are the ones tied to the vertical battens ( ahu’i ), the small sized battens which I first mentioned. The end post is the ray— kukuna in Hawaiian. These battens run between posts and between rafters, extending about three inches beyond the corner posts and rafters. The customary practice in placing battens is to put two smaller ones between the pueo ahos . In placing the battens on the rear side of the house, it is done all over from the bottom to the top excepting for a distance of one hand from the supplementary ridge-pole. But when doing the same to the front, leave one space for a door for the house, and cover all other parts with battens, as was done in the rear side. In placing battens on the ends, the larger ones are tied to all other uprights except the main post (pou ha-na); that is the chief post and is also kapu."
"O ka hoaho ana iho la nae keia o ka hale lauhala a me ka hale la-i maloo; a o ko ka hale pili he okoa iki no.

A o ka hoaho ana o na hale e ae, he pono hoaho no e like me ka manao o ka mea kukulu hale.","This, however, is how the battens are placed on houses thatched with lauhala or dry ti-leaves; but on houses thatched with the pili grass there is some difference. A double set of battens is placed, one inside and one outside. The set inside is placed as is done for a house thatched with lauhala, and the set outside is slightly different. The placing of battens on other houses is done according to the idea of the house builder."
"O ke ako ana o kela a me keia hale, he okoa no, aole i like pu, aka, no ke ako ana no o ka hale lauhala, hale pili, a koe aku ko ka hale lau-i maloo; nokamea, he hale pohihihi no ia, a aneane maopopo ole no ia oukou ke hai aku au. A o ke ana o na hale e ae he pono ako no, o keia no na hale pohihihi.","The way of thatching various houses differs, and is not the same, but [here is the method employed] concerning the houses thatched with lauhala and pili, not those thatched with dry ti-leaves, because that is a house difficult in construction, and you would hardly understand if I were to tell you. All the other houses are thatched in any way; these are the difficult ones."
"Ina he pili ka hale i manaoia nona hoi ka aho eha manamana ke kaawale, e hana i kui i elua puka ma kekahi welau a mawaena konu, o ka loihi o ke kui, ua like me akahi pi-a me ka hapa.

This stick measures about one and a half hands in length. If the house be huamoa or wai-thatched, the pointed stick has only one eye. In commencing, first thatch on two battens, then another two, and so keep agoing until sufficient have been started. In piercing string holes they must alternate, and not run in one line, lest the house leak. It is well to alternate the placing of cords, so that they would appear irregular. In preparing the lauhala, however, the thorny edges are stripped before thatching, or else it is wet with water. When the thatching is completed except near the top, two other battens are prepared and placed on either side of the ridge; these battens are called the aho kopekope and we-o . When these have been covered with thatching, again place two other battens, one on each side; and in the middle, another [ ] batten called the aho lolo , that is the one next to the supplementary ridge; these battens thatched thus are called kauhuhu ."
"O ke ako ana hoi o ka hale pili, ua like no me keia; aka, o ka nui nae o ka pupu pili e ako aku ai, ua like me akahi piha lima i kela apo ana keia apo ana, i ole e puuhaku ka hale a helelei koke i ka makani. A o ka hale lau-i maloo hoi, aole no i like me ko keia mau hale; aka, he ano e loa. Ua oi aku nae ka nani mamua o laua.","The thatching of the house made of pili is done in this same manner; but the size of each bundle of pili to be placed on the batten is equal to what one hand can grasp, so that the thatching would be even, and the house would withstand the wind. The thatching of the dry ti-leaf house is not like these houses; it is totally different. But it excels in appearance these two."
"Mahope iho o ka paa ana o ka hale, e wikiwiki i ka hana i ka loha, o olelo ia mai i ka hale ohule i ka wa hou. O ka loha o ka hale lauhala, he lau ama’uma’u, a penei e hana ai: E pii no ke kanaka i uka, a lawe mai i ka lau ama’uma’u maloo; hana no a nui, alaila hoi mai i ka hale, a penei e hana ai, e haha’i i ka lau amau mawaena i elua apana; alaila e hui i ke kumu me ka welau, a pela e hana ai a pau ke ama’uma’u i ka hanaia.

O ka lua, iluna no o ka hale e hana ai a paa.","After the house is thatched, hasten to trim it, else it would be ridiculed as a hale ohule , when it is new. The trimming for a house thatched with lauhala is the leaves of the ama’uma’u , and this is the way to prepare it: a person goes mountainwards and brings down the dry ama’uma’u leaves, obtaining a good supply before he returns to the house; and then proceeds in this manner: break the ama’u leaf in two in the middle, then bring the top point to join with the lower point (thus laying the upper half of the leaf over the lower half). Keep on in this way until the ama’uma’u is all joined. There are two ways of preparing the trimming; one way is to fix it on the ground on two long sticks, then placed against the corners and the ridge. The second method is to do the trimming right on the parts to be trimmed until the work is finished."
"O ka loha o ka hale pili, he pili no i hili ia ma ke kaupoku a me na hio o ka hale. O ka loha hoi o ka hale lau-i, he pili a he ama’uma’u no, a ua like no nae ka hana ana.

That of the ti-leaf house, however, is the pili grass and the ama’uma’u, but prepared in a similar manner. After the house is trimmed quickly secure the halakea (central) of the house, that is, the upright in the middle. The proper halakea is one that is red, and the wood from which to make it is ohia. After the halakea is obtained, then level off the ground inside the house; that is, shift the dirt around until the ground is level. On this spread old potato vines, next on that some dry grass, that is, ma’u and pili, then some old coarse mats, and then the fine mats suitable to sleep on."
"A paa ka hale i loha ia, e kukulu aku i ka halakea, oia ka laau koo mawaena o kaupoku.

Amama.” [ ]","When the house is trimmed erect the halakea, the upright in the middle supporting the ridge. When the halakea is in place construct the door. The proper woods generally used for a door frame are the ulu (breadfruit) and ohia. When this is completed the woman braids a mat for covering for the door, because that was the door of the houses of Hawaii nei in the olden time. Sometimes, however, a door is constructed like a net, and the place to which this door is attached is over the passage way: when closing, lower it, and when opening, roll it up. When the door frames are placed in position that is the time to cut the piko of the house; that is, trim those ragged lauhala leaves which hang over the doorway. During cutting, however, it is well to bring an aholehole (fish) and some young sugar-cane and also cut them; at the same time say: “Here I am a house-builder; I am cutting the piko of the house; therefore, ward off the evil influences from the house. Amen.” [ ]"
"I ka pau ana ae la o na mea nui a pau o ka hale, e pono no e kalua ka puaa me ka ai, a ahaaina no ka luhi; a ua kapaia ia ahaaina ana, he ahaaina komo hale.","After the main things of the house have been finished it is proper to bake a pig and food, and celebrate with a feast for the completed labors; such a feast is called ahaaina komo hale (feast of house entering)."
"O keia iho la na mea i loaa ia’u o ke kukulu hale ana a me ka hana ana. Aka, he mau rula nae ka’u i lohe ai no ka moe ana oloko o ka hale a me ka hooponopono ana a ko Hawaii nei:",This is what I have obtained concerning the construction of a house and what to do. But I have heard of rules in regard to sleeping in the house and the regulations by Hawaiians.
"1. E hana i kapuahi. O ke kumu e hana ia ai pela i paa ka hale a pumehana no hoi, i noho ae no ia a anuanu, hoi aku ma kae kapuahi e moe ai.","1. Fix a fireplace. The reason for doing this is to make the house complete and warm, so that when one becomes cold he moves over to the fireplace to sleep."
"2. E moe mau mawaena konu o ka hale. O ke kumu o keia hana ana, no ka makau o make i ka hou ia mai mawaho e ka powa i ka laau. A o kekahi e hoopaa i na puaa mawaho o ka hale, i hele mai ia o ke kanaka powa, alaila, puiwa ka puaa a hu ae la, alaila, ala e ae no ke kanaka oloko. A ina hoi he ilio e moe pu no. O ke kumu e moe pu ai, i na e hele mai ke kanaka powa, a komo iloko a umi i ke kanaka oloko e moe ana, alaila ala ae no ka ilio a nahu i ke kanaka kolohe. Oia no ka maa o ka Hawaii i ka moe pu me ka ilio.","2. Always sleep in the middle of the house. The reason for this is the fear of death should a murderer stab with a stick from the outside. Then again, tie hogs outside of the house, so that if a robber came, the hogs would be affrighted and grunt, thus causing the persons inside the house to awaken. If there is a dog, it sleeps together [with persons in the house]. The reason for this is so that if a robber came into the house and choked the sleeper, then the dog would awaken and bite the evil-doer. That is how the Hawaiians became accustomed to sleeping together with dogs."
"3. No ka ai ana. He nui wale na wa e ai ai o ka Hawaii, o ke aumoe a me ke ahiahi, kakahiaka nui. A o kahi e waiho ai o na wahi paipu e waiho no ma ka aoao, i ala ae no ai, ke pololi. Aole i maa ko Hawaii nei i ka ai pu, ai ae no ia, a ai ae no ia e like me kona pololi, a ke hana ia nei no pela i keia wa.","3. Concerning eating. There are many different times when the Hawaiian eats, midnight, evening or morning. The place where the calabashes are set aside is the side of the house, so that on awakening [one could] eat if hungry. Hawaiians are not accustomed to eating together; this one and that one eats as he is hungered; and that is being done at this time."
"4. No ka moe ana. I ka moe ana e moe pu no ka makuakane, ka makuahine me na keiki. I kekahi wa mawaena na keiki, a i kahi wa ma na aoao e moe ai. Hookahi no kapa e moe pu ai. He nui no paha na mea i koe, aka o ka mea keia i loaa ia’u. J. Hooili.","4. Concerning sleeping. In sleeping, the father, mother and children lie together. Sometimes the children sleep in the middle and sometimes on the sides. All sleep under one kapa. Perhaps there are many other things, but this is what I have obtained. J. Hooili."
"He nui no a lehulehu na hale i hana ia ma Hawaii nei i ka wa kahiko. No na hale pili: He maikai no kekahi hale pili i ka wa kahiko, a he nui no hoi, aka, o ka hapa nui, aohe mau hale nui, aohe hoi he maikai, he haahaa uuku wale iho no ka hapa nui o na hale ia wa.","Varied and numerous were the houses constructed in Hawaii in the olden time. Concerning houses of grass: Some houses of grass in the olden time were good and were large, but the majority were not large nor were they good. Most of the houses of that time were low and small."
"Ina makemake ke kanaka e kukulu hale, penei ka hana ana: Hoomaikai mua ka mea nona ka hale i ke kahua, a e ke hoi a papu like, alaila, e eli mua i ka lua o na pou kihi eha o ka hale a hohonu, alaila, kukulu iho na pou kihi, me ka ho-o-o ana i ka makalua i ka pohaku liilii, alaila, kanu iho i ka lepo me ka hana ia a paa loa keia mau pou kihi.

Holes were then dug for the four corner posts to the proper depth when these posts were set in; small stones and dirt were tamped in until they were firmly fixed. Stretch a line from one post to another, and indicate along it the places for digging holes for the intervening posts. Then dig there until all the holes are completed. In erecting the posts, set them in line with the corner posts. Implant them as firmly as the corner posts; those on the opposite side being erected in like manner. When all the posts are in position, the plate is placed from corner to corner. The line of posts on the rear side, however, is the one erected first. Fasten the plate with rope on the two sides. In the middle of the [ ] ends are dug the holes for the pou-hana . The pou-hana are the tall posts erected at the ends, and at the top of which the rafters of both sides meet. Plant these posts, tamping in small stones and dirt to firmly secure them. Stretch a line from one pou-hana to the other. Then lay the ridge-pole and fasten it [to the pou-hana] with cord; when this is secure, then place the rafters of the rear and the front sides so as to lie properly on the ridge-pole and fasten them; keep on thus until all the rafters are fastened, placing their lower ends of course on the plate so that the mortise of the rafters would fit the tenon of the post. That is the way to do this until it is completed. Then place the kuaiole (supplementary ridge-pole) on top, and fasten it to the ridge-pole at the junction of the rafters; then lash the lower end of the rafter and the plate to the post. Then erect other posts on the two gable ends also fastening those firmly."
"E hookawale mua i mau aho mahuahua i mau ahu pueo. O ka aho pueo, oia ka aho i hoopaa pu ia me ke o-a me ke ano kaawale iki.

E hauhoa i keia ahohui me na aho apau; pela e hana ai apau na aho.","First separate the larger battens for aho pueo. The aho pueo is the batten set on the rafter farther apart. When these battens were made fast, then smaller ones were placed between them; then the aho hui (the joining batten) is placed over these between and parallel to the rafters. Lash this batten to all the other battens; keep on thus until all the battens are fastened together."
"O ke ako ana, e hahau mua i ka hako, a i ole ka hako, ke akaakai a lauhala paha, alaila, e ka aku me ke kaula.

In cording, however, do not place intervals in line else the house would leak, but place them alternately to avoid leaks. After cane leaves or lauhala have been lashed on, then thatch with the grass. A handful when grasping the grass is the measure to go by. Lash this on with the cord with which the cane leaves were secured to the batten; work on in this way until completed."
"I ke kaupoku ana, e hehi mua mai kekahi kihi a i kekahi kihi, alaila, e kau iho i ka aho lolo, a e hoopaa pu ia aho me ke kuaiole, a i ole ia, me ke kaula i ka ia ai ke pili; a e ka i ke pili ma kela aoao keia aoao o keia aho lolo; e kukulu like nae i na poo o ka mauu.

When this is finished, add another layer in the same manner as the first aho lolo, but the grass on this layer is made thinner. On this, place the aho owili ; that is the batten on which to roll the grass and thus hide the ends of the tufts of grass and the batten from end to end; and when this twisting process is finished, braid [the grass] so as not to be pried up by the wind."
"Ua hana ia keia hale no ka pii ana i uka o ke kuahiwi i ke kapilimanu a mahiai paha.

When the person desires to sleep in the mountain, [ ] then is the house thatched. It is quickly thatched; is shady and also tight. The timber used is noni ; it is called “ noni-a ;” other woods are also proper; but this house has no posts; only arched timbers [are used] from the bottom to the top and from side to side."
"O ka hoaho aole pono ke hookawale aku, aka, e hoopili iki mai nokamea, he pokopoko ka la-i, aole hoi e pono i ka la-i maka, aka, he la-i maloo i paa, i ole e popopo wale.

In thatching, bend the ti-leaves around the battens and then tie with cords, and keep on in this manner until the house is completed. Not alone for living when catching birds or when cultivating is this house constructed, but also for a regular living house. This house lasts for two or more years; this is only a small house, conical in shape, and it is called pupupu (temporary) house and a pepepe (low) house."
"He pono laau no ko keia hale e kukulu ai, ua like nohoi ke kukulu ana o keia me ka hale la-i, he laau oio i hiki ke halawai oluna a akea pono olalo kahi e noho ai, aka, he okoa iki ka hoaho ana o keia; o ko ka la-i hoi, he haiki mai ke kau ana o ka aho, a o ko ka laumaia nei hoi he hookaawele aku ke kau ana o ka aho, no ka mea, he loloa ka laumaia.

This house also is built for mountain residence; this kind of a house is often constructed. Upon arrival at the mountain, the construction is very rapid; this house could be occupied for a long time without trouble. This house thatched with banana leaves is famous for this story: Pumaia was the man, Kamakakehau was the woman. While living together [as husband and wife] they went up to the mountain to hew timber; Pumaia was deserted by the wife; she became Koae’s, a man from another place. Pumaia was killed by Koae; the house was called pumaia (banana tree); but because Pumaia was killed, this house was named laumaia (banana leaves). Pumaia was the chief of a district. The explanation concerning this famous story is lengthy, but it is proper that I should shorten [it]."
"O ke ano o keia hale, ua like no ia me ka hale la-i a me ka hale laumaia ke ano o ke kukulu ana, aka, o ke pili o keia hale, he ilikoa; ua akaakaa ia ka ili o ke koa a uhi mai mawaho.

[ ]","In its construction this house is similar to the house thatched with ti-leaves or banana leaves, but its thatch is the bark of the koa tree. The bark of the koa is peeled and then thatched. This house is also constructed for mountain residence during the process of hewing a canoe, and for other purposes. Any kind of timber is used in its construction. Because it is covered with the bark of the koa, therefore it is called hale ilikoa . [ ]"
"O ka hale ama’u, aohe ona pou laau maoli, aohe hoi he o-a, aohe kaupoku, aka, o kona ano, he uhaki mai no i ka ama’u me ka iwi a hou ma kela aoao keia aoao, me ka hookaawale nohoi ia waena i wahi e noho ai, a e hoopio ae nohoi ia luna a e hakii iho no me ke kaula.

In the construction of some, posts, rafters and battens are used, similar to the construction of a grass thatched house, and after the frame work is up, the ama’u is thatched and fastened with cords."
"O keia hale, aia no i ke ano hale a ka mea makemake hana hale e hana ai me ka hoomakaukau no hoi i na mea apau o ka hale.

It is covered outside with cane leaves bent around the battens; at the four corners of the house, ama’u is used; also the ridge. Because this house is covered with cane leaves, it is called a hale ha-ko (cane leaf house)."
"Ua kukulu ia keia hale no ka pii ana i uka i ke kahi olona, a makemake ke kanaka e moe iuka, kukulu ae no ia i na laau, me ka hoaho ana a uhi mai ka lau o ka ape mawaho; ua kapa ia kona inoa, he hale ape.","This house is constructed when a person goes to the mountain to get olona , and he desires to stay awhile. He erects some timber [for posts] with some battens which are covered with ape leaves; it is named hale ape (ape leaf house)."
"Ua like no ka paa o keia hale me ka hale la-i; ua paa no ia no na makahiki elua a oi ae. O keia painiu aole ia e ulu ma ka honua, aia kona wahi e ulu ai maluna o ka ohia, a laau e ae no hoi.

This painiu does not grow on the ground; it grows on the ohia or other trees. Its thatching is like the ha-ko , the leaves being bent around the battens; and because the house is covered with painiu it is called a “painiu house.”"
"Ua kukulu ia na laau o ka hale, a ua hoaho ia, alaila, e uhi iho maluna i ka laumaia, alaila, hoouhi mai ka eka lepo maluna iho o ka laumaia i ole e komo ka lepo iloko.

Because it is covered with dirt it is called “ he hale lepo .”"
"O ke ano o ka hana ana i keia hale, ua like me ka hana ana i ka hale la-i, he pelupelu mai, alaila, hoopaa ia maloko o ka aho, ua ike nui ia keia hale ma na wahi mahiai iloko o na ulu laau.",The construction of this house is similar to that of the house thatched with ti-leaves; the leaves are bent over and placed on the battens; this [kind of] house is often seen in cultivated places in the wilderness.
"Ua like no kona kukulu ana me ke hale pili. O ka ha-ko maloko a i ole ia, he [ ] uki, alaila, mawaho mai ke kalamalo. Ua kapaia keia hale, he hale kalamalo.

Thatch cane leaves or uki grass first, and on that place kalamalo . This kind of a house is called “ he hale kalamalo ” (a kalamalo house). This kalamalo is somewhat like the scented [ ] plant growing at Mr. Bishop’s place, which is perhaps called wailukini (a species of lucerne)."
"Ua kukulu ia no na pou o keia hale a me na o-a aka, o ka uhi o keia mawaho he lauhala.

Soak the lauhala in water until it is supple, then scrape off the sharp thorns and thatch. This is done like the ti-leaves; the pandanus leaves are bent around the battens and fastened with strings."
"O ka mu-o o ke loulu, oia ka mea e uhi ai mawaho o ka hale; aole nae o ka mu-o i mohala ole, aka, o ka mu-o i mohala. O ke ano o keia loulu, ua ano like no ia me ka niu.

This loulu is like the coconut. The tools which the ancients used in hewing house timber were sharp, hard rocks which had been brought to an edge."
"He mau hale aku no paha koe, aka, no ka pau e o kuu pepa, ke oki nei au maanei. Josia Waolani.","Perhaps there are other kinds of houses, but because I am out of paper, I herewith cease. Josia Waolani."

Some time after it had grown to quite a height, Pele set forth on her journey here to Hawaii, thinking she would soon arrive here, but it proved otherwise. On her way she struck the place where this pandanus tree grew and she was strangled by the sharp thorns of this lauhala, with us human beings, it seemed, helping from this side; Pele struggled by using her divine powers, but she could not extricate herself. Soon after, her brother, Paao by name, appeared, with a gourd of sea-water. Said Pele, “I am in trouble indeed, brother.” Then he climbed up and from on top poured out the sea-water; the young leaves wilted and Pele was freed. Because she was full of anger Pele climbed on top and pulling out the leaf-buds, threw them hither and thither. Some landed here on Hawaii. That is the reason it grows here on Hawaii. The place of its first growth was Kohala, Hawaii; therefore Pele was the one who brought it here to Hawaii."
"Ina manawa no hoi aole o kakou moena, aka, mamuli o ka noonoo ana o kekahi alii kaulana oia wa, o Lauhiki kona inoa, e hoolilo i keia lauhala i moena mamuli o ka ulana ana o na wahine, a lilo i moena, o ka wahine mua no nana i ulana o Lauhiki no, no laila ike na wahine a pau.","Also, at that time we did not have mats, but because it occurred to a high prophetess at that time, whose name was Lauhiki, to convert this lauhala into mats by having women braid it, it was so done. The first woman who did the braiding was this same Lauhiki, and from her all other women learned."
"Eia hoi kekahi hana a ka lauhala, o ka lilo ana i pea waa no ka wa kahiko, mamuli [ ] no hoi o ka noonoo ana o kekahi kanaka o Lonoauhi kona inoa, o ka mea no nana i ulana o Lauhiki no, a me kona kaikaina o Haumea a me ka laua mau kaikamahine elima, Kamehaikaua, Meahanipaoa, Lohea, Kahuihuimalanai, Kahoanohookaohu, oia no ka pea o ka waa o Kamehameha ekahi.

The ones who braided it were this Lauhiki and her younger sister Haumea and their five daughters Kamehaikaua, Meahanipaoa, Lohea, Kahuihuimalanai and Kahoanohookaohu (that was the sail of the canoe of Kamehameha I). These persons were goddesses. The shape of the sail was round like the sun; while sailing on the ocean this was spread on the mast of the canoe when it would really appear like the sun."
"Eia kekahi hana o ka lilo ana o ka hua i mea lei no na kanaka o ka wa kahiko. O na wahine nana i hana mua, o Kahuihuimalanai a me Kahoanohookaohu , a mai a laua mai ka laha ana mai a hiki i keia wa.","Here is another use: the drupes of its fruit were strung into wreaths for people in the olden times. The women who first strung them were Kahuihuimalanai and Kahoanohookaohu, and from them the custom has spread to this time."
"Eia kekahi; aia maloo ua lei ala i ka a-i, alaila malama iho la a hiki mai ka mai pilikia, he nahu paha a me na mai e kupono ana ia laau, alaila kii ia aku la e hanai; ina no ke ola, ua ola, ina no ka make, ua make.","Here is another thing: when this wreath dries on the neck, then it is preserved until a troublesome illness appears, such as a stomachache, or other illness for which this medicine is properly used, then it is obtained and fed [to the patient]; if it be for life, he lives; if it be for death, he dies."

O KEKAHI MAU MEA O KA BAIBALA I ANO LIKE ME KEKAHI MAU MEA I HANAIA MA HAWAII NEI I KA WA KAHIKO.,SOME THINGS IN THE BIBLE SIMILAR TO SOME THINGS DONE HERE IN HAWAII IN THE OLDEN TIME.
Elua no hoike nana i hai mai ia’u no kekahi mau mea o Hawaii nei i ano like me ko ka Baibala. Akahi: O ka buke i kapaia Moolelo Hawaii. Elua: Mai kekahi poe kahiko mai e ola nei; mailoko mai o keia mau hoike e loaa’i na mea i hoohalikeia.,There were guides which pointed out to me some of the things done in Hawaii nei which were similar to those [mentioned] in the Bible. First: the book known as the Moolelo Hawaii (Hawaiian History). Second: From some old people who are still living. From these sources were obtained material for comparison.
"Ua ike kakou ma ka Baibala, o Adamu ke kanaka makamua; Kin. 1:27, a mai iaia mai i laha mai ai na kanaka a pau loa o ka honua. Ma ko Hawaii nei hoi, o Kahiko ke kanaka makamua, a nana mai o Wakea, a me na kanaka apau; a he mookuauhau no, elike me ko Adamu.","We know that, according to the Bible, Adam was the first man; Gen. 1:27, and from him came all the peoples of the earth. According to the Hawaiian version, Kahiko was the first man, and he begat Wakea, and the rest of the people; and they have a genealogy of their ancestors, just like Adam’s."
"Ua ike ia ma ka Baibala o Elia ka mea i pii aku i ka lani, ma ka mana o ke Akua; 2 Nalii, 2:11, a o Iesu Kristo, ua pii no ia ma kona ano Akua. Pela hoi, ua oleloia ma ko Hawaii nei moolelo, o Lonomuku ka mea i pii i ka lani; he wahine ia, a no ke oki e ana o kana kane i ka wawae, nolaila ua noho ma ka mahina.

O kona wahi i pii ai aia ma [ ] Hana, ma kahi i kapa ia o Hana-ua-lani-haahaa, oia ka mea i kapaia’i oia wahi, a he mea e aku no kekahi.","It is shown in the Bible that Elijah was the one who ascended into heaven by the power of God: 2 Kings 2:11; and Jesus Christ ascended because of his divine attributes. Thus is it stated in Hawaii’s history: Lonomuku ascended to heaven; she was a woman and because her husband cut off her legs, therefore she was halted at the moon. If her husband had not cut off her legs, she would have reached the locality [ ] of the sun. Her place of ascent was at Hana, the place called Hana-ua-lani-haahaa. That was the reason for so naming the place, and there is more."
"O Iona ke kanaka i noho iloko o ka opu o ka ia, wahi a ka Baibala; Iona 1:17, o Kuikuipahu hoi ko Hawaii nei iloko o ka opu o ka mano.

Kuikuipahu was Hawaii’s [celebrity] who lived in the belly of the shark. He was a chief of Kohala. Once he went surfing with a number of people; and while they were surfing, Kuikuipahu was taken by a shark. The place where he landed was Hana, at Kauiki hill; it was there he was discovered by some people. Eleio was the chief living at that time, and Kipola and Kipalalaia were the prophets; when Kuikuipahu was found, he was not dead; he was still alive."
"O Parao ame Herode kekahi o na alii hana ino i hoikeia ma ka Baibala; Puk. 1:8–22; Mat. 2:16, a me kekahi mau alii e aku nohoi. O Hakau hoi ko Hawaii nei alii hana ino. He alii ia no Waipio.

Ua oleloia o ka manawa iaia he manawa ino loa piha i na lealea ino.","Pharaoh and Herod were some of the cruel kings mentioned in the Bible; Exodus 1:8–22, Matt. 2:16, and there were also some others. Hakau was Hawaii’s cruel king. He was a chief of Waipio. This was the chief who proclaimed that the breasts of all females were to be cut off; and if he saw a man with well tattooed hands, or with good hair, or a woman with good hair, he immediately gave orders to have the hand or the head cut off. There were other cruel practices carried on by this chief. Owaia was another cruel chief. It is said that his time was a very bad period, full of debasing pleasures."
"I ko Iesu manawa i bapetisoia’i e Ioane, ua lohe ia he leo i pae mai la, mai ka lani mai, e olelo ana: “O oe no ka’u keiki punahele he oluolu loa ko’u ia oe;” Luk. 3:22, a he mau leo e ae no kekahi e like me keia, ua loaa keia ma ka Baibala. Pela no hoi ma Hawaii nei, ua lohe ia no he leo mai ka lani mai e ninau ana: “Owai la ke alii o lalo i pono ka noho ana?” “O Kahiko,” wahi a ka haina.","When Jesus was being baptized by John, there was heard a voice crying out from heaven, saying, “Thou art my beloved son, in Thee I am well pleased.” Luke 3:22. And there were other voices like this in the Bible. So it was here in Hawaii. There was a voice from the heaven enquiring, “Which of the chiefs down below lives righteously?” “It is Kahiko,” was the answer."
"I ka manawa o Ahaba ke alii o ka Iseraela, no ka nui loa o kana hana ino, ua olelo aku ke kaula o Elia iaia: “Ma ke ola ana o Iehova ke Akua o ka Iseraela, imua ona e ku nei au, aole auanei he ua, aole hau i na makahiki ekolu, ma ka’u olelo wale no;” 1 Nalii 17:1.

Thus again: When Hua was king here on Maui, Luahoomoe was the [ ] prophet at that time. Because Hua wanted to bake Luahoomoe in the oven, therefore he [Luahoomoe] told his sons where to go and live, because he was going to take away the rain (deprive the land of the rain)."
"Pela hoi, he nui na mea liilii e ae o Hawaii nei i like me kekahi mau mea o ka Baibala, aka, ua lawa ka’u hoike no keia. February 15, 1872. G.

E Keaonui e! e malu i ko kaua waena mai uka a kai, mai nae a lalo, elieli kapu, ua noa.”","During the month of Ikuwa occurs the rain called Pohakoeleele; on the day called Hua at noon, a person goes to plant. These are the names of the stalks to be propagated: hualani , hokeo , lopa , likolehua and kawelo . This is the method of planting: he takes three stalks, separating them one from the other with his fingers, and plants them. He leaves them until two months have passed; he goes to inspect them, and if he finds that they have grown well he says this: “The future [living] is provided for, the growth is good.” But if when he arrives, they are dead or drying up, he would feel grieved because they did not do well. The farmers know there is a time when plants do not grow well; that is the winter season when rains are plentiful and the shoots will die. But if a planter waits until the month of Ikiiki, of misty rain, that is when the rain is light and is easily scattered by the wind, on the day of Mohalu in the month of Ikiiki, [that] is the month for him to plant in the manner described above. These are the names of the potatoes to be planted: waipalupalu , kokoakeawe , kuapai , heauau and haole . He waits until the months of Kaaona and Hinaiaeleele are past when he goes again to look, and he finds that some are dead and some are growing. This is what he says: “My wife and children are saved by the baldheaded one.” He waits for some time longer until the grass grows, then he weeds it; this [weeding] is sufficient until the time that the potato is ripe. After weeding, leave it for many days; when the planter comes again and hills up the soil. If any potato is found while hilling up the dirt, that is, the fruit in between the plants growing on the vine, he breaks off the first potato. He returns, lights a fire in the imu, cooks the potato until done, and brings it to the house. He sits beside the doorway and prays thus: “Ye large black cloud hanging below the eye of the narrow pointed clouds, give shade, protecting shade; guard this our garden, O Keaonui; do thou cast shade over this our garden, O Keaonui; shade thou from that corner to this corner; shade thou from that side to this side; shade not another’s garden lest you be scolded for shutting out the sun and chilling the owner of that garden. O Keaonui, shade thou this our field; shade thou the hills, shade thou the leaves of our food, so that the plants would grow and the [ ] hills be filled with potatoes. O ye Keaonui, shade our garden from the head to the bottom, from the upper to the lower side; hallowed is the prayer; it is free.”"
"O keia pule ana oia no ke kahea ana i ke akua e hoi e ai i ka hua mua o ka laua mea kanu. Noho aku oia a hala ka Mahoe mua, a komo aku iloko o ka Mahoe alua.

Maanei kakou e waiho ai i ke kamailio ana no ka hooilo, e huli aku kakou e nana i na hana o ke kau.","This prayer is the request of the gods to come and partake of the first fruit of their garden. He then waits until the first Mahoe is past, and during the second Mahoe on the day of Lono, he goes to get some potatoes for food, taking some of them to the heiau (temple). Because on that night the god returns to partake of the food of his planting devotee; thus the saying: “Lives he who has a god; dead is he who has none.” After these months during which the children and the parents have partaken of the food, these also being the last months of the rainy season, the summer again approaches. Let us drop the discussion about the winter season, and take up for consideration what is done during the summer."

This is how he knows: he cuts the weeds and leaves them on the ground, and rain falls, the leaves and the dirt become wet; that is why the stalks do not die when planted in the summer season, because the weeds cover the ground and retain the moisture in the soil. But when he cultivates, he does it during the days of Laaukukahi, Laaukulua, Laaupau, Olekukahi, Olekulua, Olepau, Kaloakukahi, Kaloakulua and Kaloapau; those are the best days during which to plant, a practice handed down by our ancestors."

This ti-leaf plant grows tall, but it is not large round like other trees. I think the ti-leaf grows on all inhabited islands, but I am not sure. Where it originated I do not know; it may have been brought from some place, or it may have been indigenous. Let us consider the uses of the ti-leaf."

Just like a chief who built a ti-leaf house for himself at Puulaina and because of the fact that la-i was used, the hill was called Puula-i, as we heard heretofore. It is also used by some people for wearing [apparel] by braiding it, and, when done, wearing it."

It is used for covering the imu to retain the steam and thus cook the food. It is used for covering for fish to be roasted on coals. It is used for paiai covers. It was also used as a boat by some people in the olden time. It is braided into hula skirts and used by the dancers. It is used at feasts. It is used as a broom to clean the dirt from the mat. The midrib is used for braiding into hats. The leaf is made into pula-i ( lai whistle) which gives forth sound when blown upon.
"Ma ka pu la-i nohoi i lilo ai na kaikuahine o Aiwohikupua i poe aikane na Laieikawai, a noho like lakou me ka oluolu.

It was the case when Malio, the sister of Halaaniani, went to get Laielohelohe the younger sister of Laieikawai. She used the pula-i when Halaaniani wished to get Laielohelohe for wife; they did not succeed in their desire, however."

If the sickness be [in the nature of] sores, then ti-leaf is obtained and placed on the body, so the sores would not touch the mat and cause pain; if ti-leaf [is used] the sores do not adhere; they are cooling; the skin is not heated. It is worn on the neck by some people to prevent illness; the ti-leaf wards off and safeguards from sickness."

The plant is propagated from this part; if a la-i fence is desired, secure some, plant them around and after a while they will grow. [ ] [Here is] a story concerning its wood: At Waipio is a stream wherein lived a man-eating shark; when one came to the place (there were no bridges then) he stood on the bank of the stream and threw in a stalk of ti-plant. If it disappeared quickly, go back, the shark was there, and was not gone; to jump in was to be eaten. But, if when thrown in, the stalk did not disappear, then there was no shark; it had gone to another place; then jump in and swim across quickly, because the stream is not wide; but if you tarried or were slow in swimming you would be caught by the shark, the champion of the ocean, and he would secure a morsel of food, and he would laugh for he had obtained something."

Again it was used for simply eating; and then again it was made into a liquor called okolehao, a drink for men, women and children; that was one cause of famine when time was taken up with those kinds of pleasure. This same root was used for oil to keep the hair together so that it would not be blown by the wind. It is called ki ."

It is used in the place of fish when sojourning in the mountain, and the day when the eye [ ] bulges out for [want of] fish. This is also used as medicine for rubbing on the body, if the disease be sores on the body or on the head. This was also used for lamp light in the olden times. It is prepared by cracking the shell, leaving the kernel, which is strung together on the midrib of a coconut leaf (segment). If a feast were held at night in a house this kind of lamp was the light mostly used. It is prepared by stringing four or five sticks, when they are bunched together and wrapped in ti-leaves so that they would not burn out quickly. It is also made into oil by cooking it. When done the shells are cracked and the kernel taken and thrown on a stone or wooden board and a large block of wood is placed on top. This block is rolled all over [the kernels] and the juice [obtained therefrom] is the oil."

Proceed to where that fish is generally caught, chew some of this kukui kernel, and blow it on the sea; the sea would be smooth and oily, and that fish could be seen. So it is done when fishing for squid; like catching clams. It is also used for torches at night, when fishing for eels. These are the uses of the nut which I know about."

Here is the method of preparation: It is strung on sticks until each is full; one is lighted, and is taken and placed in a hollowed stone in such a way that the smoke would fill the hollow in said stone; after a while the soot would adhere to the stone, when it is dug out and placed in a container prepared for it; it is mixed with sugar-cane juice, and then used for tatuing the arms. Those are the uses of the nut which I have obtained."

This thing was greatly valued by the old men and the old women in the olden times. When matches had not come into use here in Hawaii, that is, the sulphur match, the old men and women used to crack the nuts open, take out the kernel, leaving only the shells, gather them by the fireside and burn them; it burns for a long time; it does not disappear quickly. That is all the use of the shell which I have obtained."

It was also used for printing kapa. [ ]"

It was also used for daubing on the hair; it was placed in a bowl or a cup, with some water added, and left to stand for a while, and when taken up the water has become lumpy; it was very good when applied to the hair; it made it smooth, shiny and slippery. Those are the uses of the kukui which I have been able to obtain."

The pupils were possessed with fear at his sternness, and also because they were afraid of human skulls and other things, so they named it the Kukui Grove of Kaukaweli. This grove of kukui is where visitors while away the time during commencement days, and it was a good thing."

John Moo.","This kukui grove grows on this island of Maui, at Makawao. It was famous because the chiefs went there in the olden times, and perhaps even to this day; it was noted as a place often visited by strangers. It was also the place where were procured the kukui nuts for the chiefs, for the kernel of its nuts was fragrant and good to the taste. This is all that I have learned. John Moo."

When the fruit of the kukui dries and falls off, then some of [ ] them will grow into a distinct kukui tree; that is where the kukui tree which we know now comes from. But the bark of this tree is used for dyeing nets, printing kapa, and blackening canoes; [but in the latter case] it is mixed with the ashes of sugar-cane leaves; the leaves were burnt to produce the ashes."
"Pela no hoi kona pua, ua hana ia i laau no kekahi mau mai, oia hoi ke nahu, paaoao, a me ka e’a, a ua ola no hoi ia ano mai i keia laau.","Its flower is used for medicine for certain ailments such as stomachache, weakness or ulcers of the mouth.

Here is another thing: The nut of the kukui is also used in place of fish; it is cooked and when it is done that is the time to eat it. It is then called inamona , because it was sweet to the taste when eaten. Still another thing: The nut is used in fishing for uhu or in spying for squid; if it were not for the kukui, these kinds of fishing could not be carried on; for the oil of the kukui is the thing which enables one to see the dark places of the ocean. That is one of its uses."

Timothy Lililea.","Here is still another use of the kukui fruit: It is made into oil. It is first gathered, and when there is plenty it is cooked in the imu; when cooked it is cracked and the shell separated from the kernel. The kernel is made into oil by pounding it on a board until it is pulverized; then a large smooth ala stone is rolled on this pulverized kukui meat. The juice is then run into a container through a strainer that would keep out the dregs. That is one use of the fruit of the kukui—for oil; but perhaps there are more uses of the fruit of the kukui, but these are what I have seen being done with my own eyes, and that is why I have brought these things for your enlightenment, my friends. Timothy Lililea."

Man was the origin of the breadfruit of that place. Before his death he had said to his children: “If I die, both of you watch the tree that may grow at the door of our house; its fruit shall be your food; the hands and hairs are the roots of that breadfruit tree, the legs are its branches, the testicle is the fruit thereon. ” At that time that was the food that saved this whole family. At the time the forty thousand gods and the four hundred thousand gods saw the fruit of this breadfruit tree, they went and plucked it and tried to eat it green, but it was not palatable; they then tried cooking it on hot coals and found it relishable. They spoke to Kane and Kanaloa of the sweetness of this fruit; to which they replied that the fruit was no other than the testes of a certain man who is now dead. At this they vomited until they were exhausted; [ ] they started to vomit in Kona and continued through the mountains till they reached Waipio. That is why the breadfruit trees became so plentiful, at that time, because the gods vomited on their way through the mountains, hence its wide spread."

Its breadfruit plant came from Kanehunamoku, brought by two men of Puuloa who were out fishing and were blown off by a heavy wind and rain storm and landed at the uninhabited land, save gods only. Therefore by them it was introduced at Puuloa and planted in a large excavation where it grew and bore fruit, which they ate. Haumea and others afterwards knew of this breadfruit tree having been brought away secretly by these men, so she came to see it herself and made a visit to these islands, but this variety of tree was not found. That is the reason she scattered the breadfruit in all lands; hence its wide distribution. This land of Kanehunamoku is in Kahiki, a land not found by explorers who are endeavoring to discover, because this is a mythical land; if this land is seen by man it is then submerged in the ocean, it can never be found, and so continues on. The good things of that land are many; the living-water of Kane and Kanaloa is found there; those who have died and their bodies turned into ashes can be brought back to life by that water."

The island of Hawaii was the most prominent in this method of bird catching. The birds desired were the soft feathered oo of the mountain, its valuable asset being the yellow feathers under the wings, for the purpose of making feather wreaths; the feathers were very expensive in price in the olden time. That was the principal use of the breadfruit sap [or gum], and such like purpose."

For instance: It can be made into poi-boards as well as door casings of the houses in olden time; also as fuel for oven cooking, and so on; it was also used for canoes in the olden time; for sleds for racing on high sloping lands, and the people staked articles of value on both sides, as in horse racing at the present time. Such were the sleds of breadfruit wood."

The soggy fruit; so called because the inside or pulp was water-soaked, lumpy and tough when eaten."

According to my own knowledge, as also from my inquiries of an experienced cultivator, there were only two methods of cultivating taro in the olden time: First, the cultivating of dry-land is distinct: Second, the cultivating of wet-land, which is different. But we must take the first division and consider it, and I will give its account as far as possible, aided by what this expert has said; that is, for the dry-land cultivation and implements used by the people of that time."

These are the woods that are fit to be made into oos: the mamane , the ohia , the wind-swept aalii , and other hardwood trees. Before they shaped them into oos this is what they first did: They called on the “hewing” deities, because if they did not first invoke the gods before they shaped their oos, then their implements would all be broken; therefore they invoked the gods of the mountain, calling on them thus:"

Then the planter awaits the fall of the first shower of rain. At the fall of the first shower the spirit of the planter is gladdened, the eyes are gratified; he then waits for one more shower that his field may be thoroughly soaked. When the second rain comes on the evening of that day, the planter goes in search of taro-tops ( huli ). These are the kinds of seed chosen, which are planted in dry land: 1, elepaio , a species of taro with spotted leaves; 2, apuwaipiialii ; 3, lehua-ku-i-ka-wao ; 4, kumu ; 5, manini and ape . Tie the seed plants into a bundle, and on the morning of the next day proceed to the prepared field; dig as many holes therein and plant out the taro-tops selected; when the field is planted then the farmer watches the field for the growth of weeds, and at their appearance he takes his wooden oo and clears the growing weeds or grass. This method of cultivation is called “ oloolohio .” This work must be done regularly until the young leaves of the seed-plant make their appearance; sometimes three or four leaves are seen, then the planter separates the planted taro-tops (hulis). because if they are not separated and the soil pressed down firmly, it was said by the [ ] people of old, the bulb would become poor and slender instead of being full and rounded. But, if the planter regularly and daily separates the decaying leaf-stalk and presses the soil around the taro plants until it nearly matures, whereby, they say, the taro is extra large, they are full and round, not long and slim."

Say, large cloud, cast your shadow from that corner to this corner; cast your shadow from that side to this side; do not cast your shadow on the field of others, you will be censured for obscuring the sun; the owner of the field might be chilled. Say, large cloud! Cast your shadow on this our field; shade the holes, shade the leaves of our food to give it growth, that the hole be filled with taro. Say, large cloud, shade our field from mountainward to seaward, from the upland to the lowland.”"

"“E Kukulia , ua mo’a ka ai, he kalo hou, ua mo’a ka puaa, eia ka ai, eia ka ia, e hoi e ai i ka ai a’u, a ka mahiai nui, e ola ’i a’u a me ko’u mau ohana.

Amen, it is done.” All then partake of the food of the farmer. This ends the account concerning dry-land farming."

It is different both in the method of its cultivation and its treatment."

The first duty of the farmer to perform was to clear the weeds; when that is done, then the banks must be made solid to prevent leakage. When a taro patch is dried, then the farmer digs the patch in blocks ( eka ) and turns it over, places the blocks against or along the banks, and the remaining dirt, or earth for the patch; because if stones only were placed along the banks the water would all flow through it. Therefore, the earth will help it. After the patch is all dug and in good order, nothing lacking, then the farmer waits a few days, allowing time to soften the earth; when he knows that the time for planting is at hand, he procures the bundle of taro tops and carries them to the patch. The planter then begins to make large mounds of earth and five men cannot encircle with their hands. After this is done, the taro-tops are then planted. Here are the names of those of the olden time: Apuwai, apowale, aweu, awapuhi, ipuolono, [ ] ieie , owene, oopukai, ohe, uwalehua, uwia, umauma, ulaula, uwahiapele , hapuupuu, hokeo, kai-kea , kai-eleele , kai-koi-o-Ewa, kumu, lauloa, lehua, lihilihi-keokeo, lola, manaulu, maunakea , moi, makohi, mahaha, mamauwea, mokulehua, manini, naioea, piko, piko-kea, poni, elepaio, apuwaipiialii, kalehua-ku-i-ka-wao , palili, pala, pipika, palakea, pueo, palai’e, wa’e and wewehiwa ."
"Apau keia mau huli i ke kanu, a paa pono ka loi, alaila, noho aku ka mahiai a liuliu.

E Kane e hoi e ai, e ola ia’u i ko pulapula, i ka mahiai, a kanikoo pala lauhala kanaka i ke ao mauloa, kau ola e kuu akua. Amama, ua noa, lele wale hoi.”","When the taro-tops are set out and the patch is planted uniformly, the farmer then waits awhile. As the weeds spring up the planter proceeds with weeding, that method of cultivation being known as “ he au loi ,” burying the weeds under the surface. When three open leaves are seen on the taro-tops the taro is on a fair way. The man then plucks as many leaves as he can which he makes into a neat bundle, and lighting a fire he roasts that bundle of luau, and when cooked separates the part that may be burnt and throws it away. Uncovering the calabash he prays to the god thus: “Say, Kane of the water of life, here is the luau, the first leaves of our food. Say, Kane, return and eat; save me, thy offspring, your cultivator, to live to an old age in the everlasting world; the life is from you, my god. Amen, it is done; it flies.” When the prayer is ended then eat of the food till satisfied."
"A pau ka pule, alaila ai ka ai, a maona, kakali aku ka mahiai o ke oo mai o ke kalo, a hiki i ka wa e oo ai, alaila, hele ua mahiai nei a hiki i na loi kalo ana, ku iho la ma kuauna, kahea akula i ke akua hooulu ai.

Say, Kukeolowalu, when man is among our taro he is lost from sight. Say, Kukeolowalu, my god to the maturing of the taro. Say, Kukeolowalu, our foodstuff must be rooted. Say, Kukeolowalu, I carry the taro and the oha and the kamau ; the mound remains as a means of existence for the farmer, some taro tops for an empty patch. Say, Kukeolowalu, bunch our foodstuff, carry it on the shoulder; light the oven for our foodstuff, bake our food; when cooked, pound it till our poi is mixed. Say, Kukeolowalu, put it in the calabash, mix our food till it is soft and smooth. Say, Kukeolowalu, split the wood, light the oven, choke the pig, place it on the hot stones, remove its hair with the heat of stones; take its insides out, bake our pig in the oven. I say, Kukeolowalu, when the pig is cooked cut it until the platter is full; let the husband partake, the wife partake, the child partake of our pig and taro. I say, Kukeolowalu, ye small board, ye large board, stir up your kapu; stir up your freedom; let earth proclaim it is free; the kapu is done away; it is freed.” After the conclusion of the prayer this and that person are at liberty to go and get some taro, for it is freed, released."
"A ma keia wahi, o ka pau keia o na mea e pili ana i ke kanu ana i ke kalo i ka wa kahiko, mai ka aina maloo, a i ka aina wai. He nui aku no paha na mea i koe e pili ana i keia hana, he ma-u keia.","This concludes the methods and treatment concerning the cultivation of taro in the olden time, both of dry-land and wet-land; there are perhaps other ways which have escaped my mind touching this subject, though this may suffice."
"Alaila, lawe mai kakou i ka lua o na mea i haawi ia mai ia kakou e imi, oia hoi keia: No ke ano o ka mahi ana o ke kalo o keia wa, mai ka ainamaloo a i ka ainawai.","Now let us take the second subject given for our consideration, and that is: the way of cultivating taro at the present time, both of the dry-land and that of the wet-land methods."

Therefore, let me relate [ ] what I have seen my grandparents do as their regular method of working. Perhaps it is best for me to first explain the planting of taro on the uplands at the present time and the methods of its cultivation ."

Our grandparents these days are enjoying a period of enlightenment and advancement; also the receipt of proper implements for performing the work. The dry-land planting of taro at this time is similar to what our grandparents did in the past, for the first thing to do is to burn off the field; that being done well, the stones are all thrown aside along the borders of the field; the act of digging holes for the plants is then begun; taro-tops are planted; the taro-tops that are to be set out at this day are the same as planted by the ancients; there are no other seed plants, and the way of cultivating is similar to that of the olden time in the treatment and care of the taro-tops, loosening the soil and pressing it down, that the bulb may be plump are identical with that of that time. Here is where it differs, in their manner of praying. At that time they prayed when the food matured: at this time, no. Perhaps there is where it varies slightly, providing the people of that time observed its practice."

January 25, 1872. Samuel K. Kainoa. [ ]","I have seen my grandparents carry their taro-tops and plant them among the ohia grove. The first thing they did was to remove the akolea fern till it was well cleared, after which the taro tops were planted and the fern leaves were then spread all over the planted field, that the dampness may be retained and the whole field be kept moist. Weeds will not make their appearance until the taro is almost matured; at the same time adhere to the practice of the old people in constantly loosening the soil, and when you see the taro at maturity it is extra large, exceeding in size that planted on the open plain. A number of residents of my locality moved to the ohia grove to take up taro culture at that time, and the crops were large. This concludes my observations of my grandparents’ practice concerning their method of taro cultivation. In conclusion, concerning the planting of taro in wet-land and things relating to its method. Respecting this subject, in my opinion it is needless for me to reiterate my remarks concerning the present method of preparing the patch, also of planting, for the reason that each and everyone of us are familiar with our every day duties, and it is unnecessary for me to relate it at this time, for the old-time method is that being observed and practiced by us, such as the loosening of the taro tops, pressing them down in the soil, and things relating thereto. Therefore, it is clear to us that though the recount shows a difference in the methods of culture it agrees in its divisions. This is the result of what I have gathered upon the subject assigned for my investigation. January 25, 1872. Samuel K. Kainoa. [ ]"
"Ua manao ia, o na makuakane o Kamehameha nana i imi a loaa, o Kahekili, o Haalou, a me Kaleiopuu, nokamea, he moe aku a moe mai ia wa, aole maopopo ke kane hookahi a me ka wahine hookahi, nolaila ua manao ia, mai kekahi mai o keia poe ekolu i puka mai ai o Kamehameha. Pela no hoi, aole i hai ia mai ia’u kona makuahine.","It was thought that the father of Kamehameha was either Kahekili, Haalou or Kaleiopuu, because at that time [the people] lived promiscuously, and no attention was paid [to the fact] of a man having for his wife one woman. Therefore it was thought that out of these three was Kamehameha begotten. Another thing, I was not told who his mother was."
"Ua hanau ia keia ma Kailua, ma ka aoao komohana o Hawaii. O kana mau hana i kona wa liilii a hiki i kona wa i nui ai, aole i hai nui ia mai.","He was born at Kailua, on the western side of Hawaii, and what he did from his early youth until he became a man has not been spoken of much."
"I ka noho ana a kanaka makua, holo aku la oia a me na kanaka he nui, maluna o na waa hookahi haneri. O ke ano o ka pea, he lauhala i ulana ia a palahalaha poepoe maikai.

O ke kumu nae o keia holo ana, no ka lealea o ke ’lii i ka maika; oia hoi, he olokaa i ka pohaku i hana ia a poepoe, a palahalaha na aoao.","When he became a man he sailed with a great many people on one hundred canoes; the kind of sails used was mats braided round and flat. They landed at Kaunakahakai and lived there. The reason for this coming was because the king was fond of maika, that is, rolling a stone which was made round with flat sides."
"I ka wa e noho ana ma Kaunakahakai, aohe ana mea e lealea’i ia wa; hoouna ’ku la ia i kana aikane o Kikane ka inoa, e kii i na ulu ia Kahekili e noho ana ma Oahu.

He sent his friend Kikane to get stones from Kahekili who was living on Oahu. When he sailed he went alone. Arriving in the presence of Kahekili, they wailed together, after which Kahekili inquired: “What does the chief desire that he sent you to me?” Kikane answered: “I came to get the stone for a plaything for your child; we came together and he is now residing at Kaunakahakai, Molokai; he sent me to come to you.”"
"Ninau hou mai kela: “I aha la ka ulu?” Olelo aku hoi keia: “Aia ka o ka ulu i ka pua o ka malo.” O ke ano o keia, he ulu alii, he ulu i malama ia i ka poli. Mai kuhihewa e na hoa, o ka ulu maoli nei, he pohaku e like me ka mea i hoakaka iki ia mamua ’e nei, ua kapa ’ku lakou ia he ulu.

O Kaikimakua hoi, ma ka aoao makani e kiola’i, oiai, he kaumaha ia ulu; o ka inoa ia o keia mau ulu, o Hiupa ame Kaikimakua.”","Kahekili again inquired: “What stone does he desire?” He replied: “The stone at the flap of the malo .” The meaning of this is that it was a peerless stone, and was carefully guarded. Do not mistake, my friends, this kind of a stone; it is made in the way above stated and called ulu . Kahekili handed over the stones saying: “This, the stone called Hiupa, is not to be cast on the windy side, lest it be struck by the force of the wind and be unsteady in its rolling, for it is a light stone; it is to be cast on the calm side; but this, Kaikimakua, is to be cast on the windward side for it is a heavy stone. The names of these stones are Hiupa and Kaikimakua.”"
"O ka Kamehameha makana i haawi aku ai na Kahekili, he ipu hulu manu. A pau ke kuhikuhi ana a ke ’lii i ua kanaka nei, lalau iho la ia i ka ipu hulu a wehe ae la, i ka ike ana iho, aole o kana mai o ka uwe; a puana ae la ia i keia mau lalani mele, penei:","Kamehameha had sent Kahekili a present of a calabash full of feathers. After the chief was through giving instructions to this man, he reached for the calabash of feathers and opened it, and when he saw what was inside he wept loud and long, saying these words in a chant:"
"Lihau mauna i ka noe, Kalae ahu i ka malie Me he pua lele io ia ’la Ke aka ka uahi i ka makani O kuu makani kilioopu O a’u wai eha I hui ia me ka ia iki Me ke kaahaaha ka ele loli. [ ]","Lihau, mountain in the mist; Kalae, clear and calm. Like a flying arrow which has been shot forth Is the shadow of the smoke carried by the wind. My wind, the kilioopu Of my four waters [Which] when joined by that youngster, The kaahaaha, turns [the smoke] to blackness. [ ]"
"A pau ke mele ana, olelo mai kela ia Kikane: “E hoi oe a ke ’lii, olelo aku e hoi i Hawaii, alaila nana mai ia’u, a uhi kapa eleele, a kau hoi ka puaa i ka nuku, alaila, kii mai i ka aina;” me he mea la, he olelo hoohuakeeo keia, o ke ano oia, aia a make kii aku i ka aina.

Ninau aku ke ’lii : “Aohe huaolelo a Kahekili ia oe?” “He huaolelo no,” wahi a ke aikane. “Pehea?” Hai aku la no hoi keia e like me ka mea i olelo ia mai iaia.","When he finished chanting, he said to Kikane: “You go back to the chief and tell him to return to Hawaii; then wait until he sees that the black kapa has covered me, and the blackness has crept up to my lips, then come to get the land.” (These words, it seems, were uttered in a contemptuous way, meaning that he [Kamehameha] should await Kahekili’s death before attempting to conquer the country.) Kikane returned to Kamehameha. The chief asked: “Did Kahekili give you no message?” “There is a message,” replied his friend. “What is it?” He then repeated what was given to him."
"A lohe ke ’lii i keia mau olelo, manao iho la ia e kipi ana o Kahekili iaia. Aole nae keia i maika i ua mau pohaku nei, a o ka hoi e no keia.

So he did not cast these maika discs on account of the home-going. The canoes were prepared and when all was ready, the men as well as the chief embarked, and sailed until they reached Kawaihae. This place is at Kohala, on the northwestern part of Hawaii. The chief lived there, and commenced the construction of the large canoes called the peleleu . At the same time the king proclaimed his law the mamalahoa , which meant that no chief or commoner should undertake anything of his own initiative; he who disobeyed was killed; it was only by doing the chief’s [Kamehameha’s] work [that he was saved]. One of the chiefs, named Keoua, did not heed this; he went of his own volition and slaughtered the people of Waimea. Kamehameha, however, did not immediately visit the penalty of the law on him."
"I ke oki ana i ka waa a me ka hana ana a maikai, ekolu makahiki pau eono lau waa, ua like ia me elua haneri a me kanaha.

When he finished this he went and resided at Hilo where he built another six forty canoes in three years, which added to those already built made 480 canoes in six years. When this was finished, the chief returned to Kawaihae where he again built six forty canoes in another three years, which added to the former made 720 canoes in nine years. After which he again went to Hilo where he built six more forty canoes in another three years, and together with what had been already built, gave him 960 canoes constructed in twelve years; and that satisfied the chief."

When they came to Keoua’s presence he asked: “Why did you two come to me?” They answered: “The chief sent us to come and get you.” Keoua said: “If the chief contemplates death for me, this is the proper time for you to say it.” Kamanawa and the other replied: “Your nephew does not desire your death; your nephew loves you; that was why we were sent.” Keoua’s advisers said to him, “O ye chief! those words which have been spoken are false; they are lies—no truth in them; but this is our advice: let us go overland: if we go overland, then Kamehameha has death, and so have we.”"

When they arrived at Kawaihae, [ ] they saw that the place was covered with a multitude of people. The chief Keoua then realized that he would be killed, so he reached for a cord and tied around his person. The men whom Kamehameha sent to him said: “It is high time for you to be girding up your loins; you will be killed for being cruel to others, for rebelling, for disobeying the laws of the chief.” Then Keoua and his retinue wailed with loud voices. Kamanawa and Kameeiamoku seized Keoua and held his head under the water until he died, whence he was taken and baked in the imu. After Keoua died, one of his attendants, Kaoleioku, begged Kamehameha, “O ye chief! grant me protection that would save me.” Kamehameha gave him the papa as such; he rejected it, saying that could not save him. Kamehameha next gave the water of Ahukini (perhaps this water is still at Kawaihae at this time). He persisted in his refusal, saying that could not save him. So Kamehameha granted him the mamalahoa, saying at the same time, “No subject and no chief shall take your life; you may live!” The other chiefs objected to this [gift] and said that mamalalaau should be given instead, meaning by this a law which would allow of his being killed; but Kamehameha would not concede, for he had already spoken. Then one of Keoua’s attendants, Wailama, cried as follows:"
"Kuu haku i ka ua haao Ke lele mauka o Auaulele Lele ka ua, lele pu me ka makani, Lele poo a na ka wai o ka ha Kuu haku mai ka wai haule poo.","My lord of the driving rain, The rain flying in the upland of Auaulele: The rain flies, flying with the wind, Flying to the headwater [the spring] to give it life.

These canoes touched at Haneoo, Hana. Kahekili had arrived from Oahu, and it was made known that it was his intention to wage war on Kamehameha. Kamehameha was sent for. He came from Hawaii, and on arriving the fighting began, and was kept up until Kahekili was defeated. Kahekili returned to Oahu while Kamehameha returned to Hawaii. Kamehameha, however, set up the image called Kawalakii, clothing it with ahuula and with mahiole for a hat; a spear and a war club of Kona were placed by it, and it was consecrated to Malio. Because Kahekili’s famous soldier, Keawepuahiki, saw that it did not move he went and struck at it with a club and broke it into small pieces. Kahekili sent another famous soldier, Kapakahili by name, to battle with Kamehameha, and they fought here on Maui until Kapakahili was defeated. Then Kamehameha returned to Hawaii, and when he heard of Kahekili’s death he went after his kingdom. Then Kaiana rebelled, but was not victorious over Kamehameha."

That was the time of the sounding reed, that is, a thinned stem of coconut leaf placed on a flat piece of wood which fitted in the mouth; or it may be fibrous lauhala, and so forth. After three years here, he returned to Hawaii. [ Keakaloloa. ] [ ]"
"Ua Hanau ia o Kawelo ma Pupulimu i Waimea, Kauai. O Heulu ka makuakane, a o Haiamu ka makuahine, na laua mai keia keiki o Kawelo.

Heulu was the father, and Haiamu was the mother, of whom the child, Kawelo, was begotten. During Kawelo’s childhood he was a timid stripling whenever his companions or others challenged him to fight. His elder brother was Kauahoa, who was born of the same parents. Kauahoa had been previously adopted by Haulili, the great one of Hanalei. The purpose for which his elder brother had been taken away was because he was found to be very strong, and, therefore, was feared lest he should kill his younger brother."
"E huli ae kakou a nana aku ia Kawelo.

While Kawelo dwelt peacefully with his parents a desire entered his mind to go sea bathing, which was his favorite pastime from his infancy up to the time of his death. In his eighteenth year a secret longing prompted Kawelo to seek the wives of his half-brother, Aikanaka, the king of Kauai. Said he to Heulu, his father: “How amazing is the greatness of my desire for the wives of my lord brother! By what means may they be obtained?” Whereupon the father asked: “Do you really wish the wives of your lord to be yours?” “Yes,” Kawelo replied. “Here is the means whereby they may be won: let me teach you how to fish.”"
"O ko laua nei a’o iho la no ia, aole no hoi i emo ia a’o ana iho, o ka makaukau no ia o ua Kawelo nei. O ko ianei hele aku la no ia i ka lawaia. Aole no i emo ia lawaia ana, ku ka paila o ua mea he i’a. Oi kali wale aku keia, aohe no he loaa iki o ua mau wahine nei iaia, ninau aku keia i ka makuakane: “Aohe loaa iki o na wahine a kuu kaikuaana haku ia’u.” “O hele i ka mahiai,” wahi a ka makuakane, hele keia i ka mahiai, a hewahewa ua mea he ai aia nei o ke kanu ana.

Wherefore he immediately went out to fish. In a short period of fishing a great heap of fish was caught. He patiently waited for, but failed to secure the women; so he said to the father: “I can not in the least obtain the wives of my elder brother.” “Then go farming,” answered the father. He went to till the soil, and the things that he planted thrived. He waited, but could not secure [them]; then he meditated: “Indeed! It appeared as though my father’s instructions to me were the wise policy whereby those women may be mine; but lo! they are not.”"
"A mahope iho, hoomaka keia e a’o i ka hula. I ko ianei a’o ana i ka hula a makaukau, hoomaka keia e hula iwaena o ke anaina. I ko ianei hele ana e hula, ua kakua ia ua o Kawelo nei i ke kapa ahuula.

O ko lakou nei noho iho la no ia, noho a kane a wahine. E waiho kakou no ke kamailio ana no Kawelo me na wahine ana, a e huli ae kakou no Aikanaka.","Thereafter, he began to learn dancing. In educating himself to dance, and becoming proficient therein, he immediately held a dancing exhibit before a large gathering. When he went to dance Kawelo was arrayed in a feather cape. The women saw that Kawelo was very skillful in dancing, so they fell upon him and kissed him. [ ] At that moment he mused, “At last here is the means whereby I have secured both, which is dancing.” When he had finished dancing, and when night had come, the women went and met Kawelo; whereupon they lived as husband and wives. Let us leave the narrative of Kawelo with his wives and turn to Aikanaka."
"Aia ia Aikanaka e noho ana me ke aloha i na wahine ana, kupu mai la ka manao iloko ona e kii e pepehi i ka pokii ona, oia o Kawelo. Mahope iho, hui na kanaka a pau o Kauai a kuka pu me ke alii nui o lakou, oia o Aikanaka. Hoomaka ia e a’o i na ihe, a ua nui loa ke akamai o na kanaka ma ia hana.

Soon afterwards all the people of Kauai assembled and consulted with their great king Aikanaka. The task of spear practice was begun, and the men became highly dexterous in that service. They spent much time in its exercise, and, very long afterwards, a longing took hold of Kawelo to go sightseeing in circuiting Oahu; hence, he said to the father: “How great is my desire to sail and tour all of Oahu!” The father answered: “Go as your desire dictates.”"
"O ko ianei hele mai la no ia. Iaia, nei nae e hele ana ma ke alanui, ku ana o Kamalamaikipokii, a ninau ana ia Kawelo: “E hele ana kau huakai mahea?” Olelo mai o Kawelo, “E holo ana au e makaikai ia Oahu, a hoi mai.” O ko ianei olelo aku la no ia, “E aho la hoi owau kekahi e hele pu me oe.” Ae mai kela a kau maluna o ka waa, o keia waa a laua i kau ai no Kaulukauloko ame Kaulukauwaho.","Upon which he set out; but while he was traveling along the road, young Kamalama approached and inquired of Kawelo: “Whither are you bound for?” Kawelo replied, “I am going to sail and tour Oahu and then return.” Whereupon the former said, “It is well then that I, too, shall accompany you.” The latter gave his consent and boarded the canoe. This canoe, on which they embarked, belonged to Kaulukauloko and Kaulukauwaho."
"O ko lakou holo mai la no ia a hiki ma Oahu. Halawai mai la meia nei o Kou, no Puuloa, Oahu, he wahine maikai. A liuliu iki, hoomaka keia e hele e halawai me ka lawaia nui o Oahu nei ia wa, oia o Makuakeke.

E waiho iki iho kakou no laua nei, a e kamailio ae kakou no na makua.","Soon they all sailed out for and landed at Oahu. Kou, a beautiful woman of Puuloa, Oahu, met him. In due time he started out to call on the celebrated fisherman of Oahu here at that time, who was Makuakeke. Kawelo immediately asked of Makuakeke: “Are the fish of this locality famed for their not being entrapped by the net, caught?” The latter replied: “One has been captured, but the other one is still at large.” “What of it? Let us go out to entrap it; perhaps we may capture it.” So they paddled out until they arrived off the point of Kaena. Just as they approached the spot, Makuakeke bent his head down to make observations and saw the fish swimming about. “Here is that fish,” said the fisherman. Let us leave these two awhile and speak relative to the parents."
"Aia i na makua e noho ana ma Kauai, luku ia aku la ka poe a pau e pili aku ana i ua mau makua nei, a me ua mau makua nei no hoi kekahi. Kipaku ia aku la nae ua mau makua nei a noho kaawale aku la ma kahi kaawale loa. [ ]","As the parents were residing on Kauai, every one in their neighborhood, including themselves, were attacked. Moreover, the parents were driven away, and they retired to a very distant place. [ ]"
"Ia Kawelo ma nae e nanea ana i ka nana i ua i’a nei, me ka hookuu pu no hoi i ka laua upena, aole no hoi he wahi mea a make iki o ua i’a nei. O ka inoa nae o ua i’a nei o Uhumakaikai.

Pane aku keia i ke aikane: “E hele kaua i ka nana heenalu a na kanaka.” O koi ala ae mai la no ia.","While Kawelo and companion were busily engaged in watching the fish and also in casting their net, the fish could not be caught. The name of the fish was Uhumakaikai. They toiled on, but it could not be entrapped; for which reason they came back. As they were paddling back Kawelo observed a large gathering of men and women and questioned the fisherman: “What is that assembly for?” “It is a surf-riding crowd. But there is only one who is unparalleled; it is a young woman. She is never wet by the surf.” The first asked, “What is the name?” The latter replied, “Kanewahineikiaoha.” And when he had memorized the name of the young woman they paddled for and disembarked at the landing where the friend, Kamalama, then stood in waiting. Said he to his friend: “Let us attend the surf-riding sport of the crowd.” To which the latter consented."
"A hiki laua nei malaila, ninau aku o Kawelo i ke aikane: “Ua ike nae paha oe ia Kanewahineikiaoha?” “Ae,” wahi aiala. O ko iaia hee mai la no ia i ka nalu; a kahi nalu, alua, i ke kolu o ka nalu, o ka hii mai la no ia i ka papa, hopu no i ka lole, komo, a o ka pea mai la no ia hoi.

At which the one in question came surfing in with the breakers; one, two, and on the third breaking of the surf she landed, snatched up her board and her dress, donned it, and was soon on her way homeward. Then Kawelo said to his friend, “You follow her.” Kamalama immediately followed and hid himself. As he lay in concealment he saw the javelins of her brothers hurled in great numbers at her; therefore, he returned and stood before his friend, who asked: “How fares it?” “Say! You are asking me; there is nothing in that performance but death. When I journeyed thither and hid myself, I observed the one in whom we have been interested resting. I saw her brothers thrusting their spears.”"
"O ke kupu ae la no ia o ka manao iloko o Kawelo, e pii e hoa’o e nana, a pane aku i ke aikane: “E aho e pii kaua e nana. Heaha la auanei ka hewa ke make kaua.” O ko iaia ae mai la no hoi ia.

Ia laua nei i ike aku ai i ua kaikamahine nei o ke kau aku la no ia o ua Kawelo nei i ke mele, penei:","Whereupon Kawelo made up his mind to go up and reconnoiter; so he said to his friend, “It is best that we both go up to investigate. What is there to repent should fortune be against us?” To which the other consented. As they journeyed upward and reached the house, the woman had just finished bathing; but the javelins of the brothers were her bath water. When they espied the young woman, Kawelo called forth in a chant as follows:"
"Aia la o a’u lehua i Luluupali, Ke paialewa ia ala e ka makani moae. E nana aku ana ia oe e ke hoapaio I hoa-aloha au nou e!","There is my lehua at Luluupali Which is wafted by the cold wind. I am beseeching you, O antagonist, To accept me as your friend."
"A pau ka ia nei kau ana aku i kana mele, o ka pa mai la no ia o ke kahea a ua kaikamahine nei. O ko laua nei hele aku la no ia a komo ana iloko o ka hale.

The father of the young woman said: “What is the cause that brings you two hither?” He replied, giving his answer precisely, “Both of us have come here to investigate into your performance; that is the cause for which I journeyed hither.” Immediately they were taught, and they attained skill in that branch. They remained under instruction until the use of all weapons had been taught them, when fear dawned on the instructor lest [ ] they should all be defeated by Kawelo; so he withheld a certain method which he did not impart to Kawelo—this was warfare with stones."
"Oi noho aku lakou nei a liuliu wale, o ko ianei mare ae la no ia me Kanewahineikiaoha ke kaikamahine a ua kanaka nei. Kupu mai ka manao iloko o Kawelo e kii hou no i ua i’a nei a laua i lawaia mua ai me Makuakeke, a olelo aku i ka wahine: “E hele ana au i ka lawaia.” O kahi nae a lakou e noho nei, aia no ma Waiawa, Oahu.

A thought seized Kawelo to go again after the fish which he and Makuakeke had attempted to catch, so he said to the wife: “I am going out fishing.” Now, the place they were then residing was at Waiawa, Oahu. He immediately set out to join his fishing companion, and both sailed out and arrived at the place where they had formerly floated. They lowered the net, but the fish became shy and kept away from the net. Kawelo remarked: “We shall not be able to catch the fish. If we can secure an uhu, then, we can have a bait that will tempt it.” This is a fact that has found expression among the composers of chants, in this manner: “The fish are tamed by the tempting bait,” etc."
"E waiho kakou no laua nei, a e kii ae kakou no na makua o Kawelo i Kauai. Aia i na makua o Kawelo e noho ana me ka pilikia, holo mai la kekahi mau kanaka e kii mai ia Kawelo i Oahu nei.

O ka makuakane ona, ua kipaku ia e Aikanaka. Oia ko maua hiki ana mai nei.”","Let us leave the two and go back to the parents of Kawelo, on Kauai. Whilst Kawelo’s parents remained in constant dread, some men journeyed here to Oahu to summon Kawelo. Their food on this voyage consisted of a few balls of popolo and a few fours of fleas. When they had arrived at the house of Kamalama, he asked: “What brings you two here?” “We came to fetch Kawelo. His father has been driven away by Aikanaka. That is why we came.”"
"O ko Kamalama liuliu iho la no ia i kona waa e kii ia Kawelo; o ka holo aku la no ia aole i lihi launa aku, pa e no kahea a ua Kamalama nei: “E Kawelo e! Ua pilikia ou mau makua.

Nolaila au i kii aku nei ia oe.”","Kamalama thereupon prepared his canoe to go after Kawelo; he set out but was still at a great distance when he commenced to call out: “O Kawelo! Your parents are in trouble. They have been ousted by Aikanaka.” Whence the friend returned, thinking that he would be overtaken and defeated by Kawelo. Kawelo heard the call, but paid no attention to it, for he wanted to capture his prey. When the fish was caught the fisherman said to him: “You are being called.” Whereto Kawelo turned around and commanded: “Sit firmly.” No sooner had Makuakeke taken a firm seat than he heard the breath drawn in, Kawelo being sure to overtake Kamalama. Six strokes of the paddle by the superhuman one brought them to the landing. As to the fisherman, however, he was constantly rocked about on the canoe; and the stem of the canoe pointed to this and that direction. His friend’s canoe was then being lifted. The stern had not yet reached the shore when Kawelo’s canoe shot in, and he said to his friend: “Why did you call me?” “You were called; our parents are approaching death. For that reason I went forth to summon you.”"
"O ka liuliu iho la no ia o ua Kawelo nei me ka wahine, me ke aikane, me na [ ] ulu a ia nei, he umi. Eia na inoa: o na ulu elua i holo pu mai ai mai Kauai mai, oia o Kaulukauloko ame Kaulukauwaho, Kauluikapapaakea, Kauluikawekiu, Paapaaina, Aumai, Hawewe, Haulili, Hanaula, ame Aiwohi.

[ ] Here are their names: the two ulus that had come together from Kauai, who were Kaulukauloko and Kaulukauwaho; Kauluikapapaakea, Kauluikawekiu, Paapaaina, Aumai, Hawewe, Haulili, Hanaula and Aiwohi. They immediately set to work, but Kawelo was fashioned so as to resemble a roll of mat and deposited squarely on the canoe. Then they sailed out and appeared outside of Wailua, on Kauai."
"Ia wa ike e mai la no o Aikanaka ke ’lii nui he waa keia e lana aku nei, a o ke kahea aku la no ia i kahi elele ana: “E Haweo e!” “E-o,” wahi a Haweo. “E holo oe e nana i kela waa, he waa kaua paha, a i ole ia, he waa makaikai paha?” O ko ianei holo mai la no ia a ku ana ma uka o ke awa, a ninau ana i na kanaka o luna o ka waa: “He waa aha ka waa?” Pane mai o Kamalama: “He waa kaua.” “O kena waa hookahi wale no la e pau iho no o Wailua nei ia oukou?” O ka hoi aku la no ia o ua elele nei a ku ana i mua o ke alo o ke alii.

The king said: “What is the nature of the canoe?” “A war canoe.” Immediately some warriors were sent out; Walaheeikio was their chief and skilled in various wars. His (Kawelo’s) ulus saw him; and Kamalama said: “There he is, a man with warriors.” Kawelo informed [them]: “That is Walaheeikio. You disengage me.” At which he was taken out, and he stood on the platform of their canoe. The warrior of Aikanaka called forth a challenge: “Who is your champion of that canoe?” Kawelo then replied: “Myself.” The warrior remarked: “There is not the slightest doubt that this javelin will spare you. My javelin has not even missed the blade of grass and the grasshopper, but lo! with yonder hut, my javelin shall never fail to hit the mark.” Kawelo thereupon recited this chant:"
Walaheeikio e! Walaheeikio e! Pahu ana oe i kau ihe; A pekua ae i ka pola o ka malo— He mea mai nui nou ka hilahila ea!,O Walaheeikio! O Walaheeikio! When you thrust your javelin It is warded off with the end of the loin-cloth— Won’t the degradation be a pain to you!
"“Aole paha e hala keia ihe ia oe.” Oia ku no ko ua koa nei a pololei, i pahu aku ka hana, pekua ia oia i ka pola o ka malo. E pahu mai ana o Kawelo i kana ihe—o ka inoa o ka Kawelo ihe oia o Koihelaumeki—e hamo ia iho ana ua koa nei. Hookahi no ia pahu ana, mai ka piko o ke poo a makau ka laau a ia nei i kahi ino ona.

Hana ia iho i ka iala ihe a mokupu mai ke poo a hala ilalo.”","“This javelin would not, perhaps, miss you.” The warrior planted himself erect but on thrusting, his spear was warded off with the end of the loin-cloth. Kawelo was at the same moment thrusting, his javelin—the name of Kawelo’s javelin was Koihelaumeki—and the warrior was laid low. With that one thrust the weapon made a clean cut from his head and lodged in his detested spot. Kawelo’s ulus were vigorously conducting the war, the informant being the one to escape. Said Aikanaka, “How fared your battle?” “Lo, you question! We have all met with disastrous defeat, and I am the only one spared. Maybe I have escaped by a hair’s breath from falling into their power; and furthermore, I admit that our leader, who was sent [ ] thither, received no brutal treatment; he was told to thrust his javelin, but it was warded off with the end of the loin-cloth. Then the other sent his javelin home, and he was pierced from the head clear down.”"
"O ka hoouna hou ia ae la no ia o kekahi mea hou me kona mau koa, oia o Maumauikio. I ka hiki ana mai o Maumauikio me kona mau koa, olelo aku o Aikanaka: “Pehea? E make no anei o Kawelo ia oe i keia la?” Olelo aku keia: “E make ana no ia’u, nokamea, o kela koa no o makou, aole no i makaukau. Owau ka mea i makaukau ma keia hana.” O ko ia nei iho aku la no ia me na koa, a ku ana keia ma ke awa. O ke kau aku la no ia o ua koa nei i ke mele, penei:","Soon another leader, who was Maumauikio, and his men were sent for. On the arrival of Maumauikio and his warriors, Aikanaka inquired: “How is it; can you overcome Kawelo today?” The other replied: “He shall be defeated by me, because that warrior of ours was not skillful enough. I am the one who has a wide experience in this art.” Upon this, he went down with the soldiers and soon appeared at the landing. Then the warrior called forth in a chant as follows:"
"O ka laula Kapaa ka’u minamina, Ke paialewa ia ala e ka makani naulu, E hoohaehae ana i ka wai paoa, E i mai ana paha ia’u he pumaia—e!","I bewail the broad expanse of Kapaa, That is being traversed by the naulu wind, Which is challenging the wai-pa oa [wind]; That is perhaps considering me a bunch of bananas."
"A pau ke mele ana a ua koa nei, o ke kau aku la no ia o Kawelo i kana mele:","And when the warrior had finished, Kawelo then responded with his chant:"
"Huli, haliu Kawaikini-a-Kane Hakai lua nei i ke anu o Waialeale O ke kupu no ia o Maunahina—e! A Maunahina huki na pea a ke koolau O ka hoi ka pakele e ke hoapaio Aloha oe—e!","Turn around! Observe Kawaikini-a-Kane That is exceedingly permeated with the chill of Waialeale. Yes, that is the gift of Maunahina! At Maunahina descended the ends of the koolau wind. To return is the safety, O combatant. Woe betide you!"
"O ka pane aku la no ia o ua koa nei: “Aole paha au i hele mai nei e hoolohi; aole paha e hala keia ihe ia oe. Aole no he ike o Walaheeikio, ua hiki no kona make ana, aka, owau, aole e hala kuu ihe ia oe.” Kau mai no o Kawelo i kana mele, penei:","Whereto the warrior replied: “I came not to delay; this javelin, perhaps, shall not spare you. Walaheeikio possessed no knowledge; it is well that he was vanquished. But I —my javelin shall never miss you.” At this Kawelo recited his chant, as follows:"
"Maumauikio—e! Maumauikio — e! Pahu ana oe i kau ihe A pekua ae i ka pola o ka malo, He mea mai nui nou ka hilahila, ea!",O Maumauikio! O Maumauikio! When you thrust your javelin It is warded off with the end of the loin-cloth— Won’t it be a shame that will pain you greatly!
"E pahu iho ana ua koa nei i kana ihe, paa ia mai e Kamalama ka ihe a ua koa nei. E pahu ia mai ana e Kamalama a make ua koa nei. Auhee aku la na koa; e alualu aku ana na ulu a Kawelo a koe no ua wahi kanaka nei i hookoe ia ai mamua, poholehole nae ke kua i ka ualu ia aku. Oi noke o Kawelo i na koa a pau i ka make.

Aohe o kakou wahi i koe, ua pau kakou i ka make.”","As the warrior thrust his javelin it was held fast by Kamalama. Kamalama then made a thrust and the fighter was killed. The soldiers fled, but were annihilated by the ulus of Kawelo, and the individual that had been spared before was left; his back was, however, injured from having been scratched. Kawelo started to slay all the soldiers. In the meanwhile a desire came into Aikanaka who commanded the messenger, saying: “It is perhaps well that you summon Kauahoa to come hither and combat with his younger brother. We have no hope left; we have been made powerless—utterly hopeless and despairing.”"
"Pupuu a hoolei loa ku ana ua wahi elele nei i ke kahawai o Hanalei a kahea ana. I nana aku auanei ka hia e moe ana no ua Kauahoa nei, hoi ka wai i uka, pilau ka [ ] oopu o kai!

Kauahoa was lying in deep slumber—the water returned to the upland; the gobies decayed in the lowland! Then he called: “Say, [ ] Kauahoa! Your older brother is in trouble. They have been placed in a dangerous position by your younger brother, Kawelo.” At that moment he awoke and said: “Return and I will follow.” He immediately bestirred himself and as his weapon, Kahihikolo, which was sacred to Kumakaohuohu, his superior younger brother, stood near at hand, the sacredness was ignored; he uprooted it, trunk and leaves, and went down and stood at the landing. His younger brother saw and recited his chant, as follows:"
"E ala e Kauahoa! Ke kamaeu o Hanalei, Huhua kana moe i ke awakea, Kapae ke kaua e ka hoahanau— waiho ia’u i kou hanauna.","Awake, O Kauahoa, The champion of Hanalei! Strikingly strange is his slumber during the noonday. Postpone the battle, O companion-in-birth; Spare me who is your kinsman."
"Olelo aku o Kauahoa: “Aole paha e na iho kuu laau ia oe. Kui lei no kaua: lawa no ko’u lei, lawa ole no kou. Mimi no kaua: loihi no ko’u mimi, loihi ole kou. Aole paha e waiho iho keia laau ia oe.” E uhau iho ana o ua Kauahoa nei, pa nolu iho la i ke kua o Kawelo, e kauoha ae ana kela i na ulu a ia nei: “E Kaulukauloko, Kaulukauwaho, a pela aku, nai kai a oukou, kohia ka lala o ka laau.” I hoeu ae ka hana o ua Kauahoa nei aohe eu ae.

Let us string flowers; my garland is completed, whereas yours is not. Let us urinate. I urinate for a length of time; you, a short time. Why, then, will this weapon spare you?” Kauahoa struck but [the blow] fell harmlessly on the back of Kawelo, who urged his ulus forward: “O Kaulukauloko, Kaulukauwaho, etc., strike vehemently; and hold the weapon down fast.” When Kauahoa tried to withdraw [the weapon] it moved not. Kawelo ran his spear, Kuikaa, from head to foot, and Kauahoa was killed."
"Aia ia Kawelo e hoonanea ana me ka loaa ole o ka mea nana e hoonioni i ke kaua, aka, mahope nae o ko laua noho pu ana me kana wahine, o ke kii ia mai la no ia o ka wahine a ianei e ka haku alii, oia hoi o Aikanaka.

At this, Kawelo was left without a wife. Because Kawelo grieved very much for his wife, a thought came to him to seek a way whereby his older brother might be thwarted."
"Noho wale iho no keia me ka mine ana iho iloko ona: “Heaha la ka’u e hana aku ai iaia. ” “O ka make paha, o ke ola paha.” A liuliu wale kona nune ana, ia manawa, ike aku la keia i ka piha mau o kai i ka heenalu, o ka piha mau iho la no ia mai ke kakahiaka a po, a nui loa ka makemake iloko o Kawelo.

Either death, perhaps, or life?” And when he had spent some time in musing, all at once he noticed the crowd assembled on the lowland for surf-riding, which always drew a gathering from morning to evening, and great was the desire of Kawelo; consequently he forgot his wife and engaged in his favorite pastime of surf-riding. Let us now depart from the narrative of Kawelo and speak about the beloved friend of the marvelous one and his ulu followers."
"Aia ia lakou e noho ana me ka hoonanea i ka lakou hana, oia hoi ka oo ihe, a mahope oia wa a lakou e hana nei, kupu mai la ka manao iloko o ke ’lii, o Aikanaka e [ ] pepehi ia lakou nei a pau i ka make; a pane aku i ka wahine a ke kaikaina i lawe ia mai ai eia: “E! e ka wahine i lawe ia e a’u mamuli o kuu mau lima.” “Heaha?” wahi a ka wahine. “Pehea, e make ana no anei ia’u o Kawelo a me na ulu ana?” Hai mai ka wahine: “Ina he makemake kou e make kuu kane a me na ulu ana, eia wale no ke kumu e make ai, ina he makemake, e make mua na ulu, alaila, e kuahaua oe i na kanaka a pau e poalima, aohe he kanaka noho aku iloko oia wa au e olelo ai; noho no make.

Thereby the ulus will be killed, and afterwards my husband. Furthermore, however, I have instructed my husband: all things were taught him, except one, and that is fighting with stones, which art I did not teach him. But if he should come out unscathed from that death-dealing method, what a great pity would it then be that our bones should be allowed to bleach in the sun.” The other remarked: “Does he know what he has in store?” Soon after this, Aikanaka summoned all the men to assemble; no man should stay back, and if any was absent from the king’s call, death would be the penalty. Let us leave the proclamation of the king and turn aside to the ulus of Kawelo. What are they doing now?"
"Aia i ka wa a ua poe ulu nei e hoomakaukau ana e pii i ka makaikai i ke kuahaua a ke ’lii, olelo mua aku o Kamalamaikipokii i ka nui ulu o lakou: “I pii auanei kakou a i hiki i ka poalima, mai lalau kekahi o kakou, e noho pu no kakou ma kahi hookahi, malia he kuahaua hana make keia no kakou.”","While the ulus were making preparation to attend and ascertain the object of the king’s proclamation, young Kamalama first cautioned the most of the ulus: “Should we ascend, and should the labor day approach, do not one of you go off; we must remain in one place together; maybe this is a summons wherein our death is planned. ”"
"Ae mai la no hoi na ulu, ko lakou nei pii aku la no ia a hiki i kahi i hoomakaukau ia no ka hana. I nana aku auanei ka hana o lakou nei, me na oo wale no ka nui o na kanaka e paa ana i ka lima.

They therefore went up and approached the place that had been set apart for the work. To their surprise, they noticed the majority of the men held diggers in their hands. But Kamalama had brought his javelin, Hawae, along. Said he to the ulus: “In the event of our remaining here, and the king commands us to ascend to perform the labor, then go up in a body. Here it is: Doom appears to lurk before me—we are going to be killed, and no survivor will remain.” Kaulukauloko remarked: “Decidedly so; if we are defeated by them, that is all to it; but wait until the trial takes place.”"
"Mamua nae o ka hoomaka ia ana e pepehi ia lakou nei, ua hoomakaukau mua ia e na kanaka ame ke ’lii he mau puu pohaku nui ewalu maluna o ka puu, o ka inoa o ua puu nei, oia o Hulili.

Immediately the ulus were surrounded, and they were trapped in the center . He (Kamalama) heard the king command that the diggers be thrust; that the stones be thrown. Kamalama said to the ulus: “There is no hope left! Seek your strength in order to escape.” The ulus began to press forward. They all fought on furiously from early morning until the sun had passed the zenith; two ulus still survived, and nine were killed. The names of the remaining ulus were Kauluikapapaakea and the friend of Kawelo, Kamalama. Nevertheless, the greater part of the men had been [ ] killed by Kamalama; and had the men been less in number they would all have been slain by Kamalama. They moved towards the sea, with a hope of securing aid should his friend notice [them]. The greater force pushed the battle on until Kauluikapapaakea had been killed, leaving Kamalama alone."
"Ua luhi loa ua Kamalama nei i ke kaua, nokamea, nana wale no i kokua i na ulu a pau lakou i ka make. O ka ihe nae a ia nei ua poomuku, a koe o kahi wale no e paa ana i ka lima.

As to his javelin, it was broken short, and only the handle was left. At this moment Kawelo beheld this great horde of men, and Kawelo was still in the lowland surf-riding, as it was his favorite sport. Fear crept into him, and when Kamalama saw his friend, since he was powerless to resist and his strength well spent and his javelin all splintered, he straightway raised their chant, as follows:"
Aia la o a’u lehua i Makanoni! Ke punia mai la e ke anu o ke koolau. Ke hakoi lua nei loko i ko aloha: E ike ana paha oe aole paha—e! E aloha oe—e!,"There is my lehua at Makanoni!

This is the manner in which he called:"
"Ku mai! Ku mai! Ka nalu nui mai Kahiki, Mai popoi kai uli, kaikoo loa.","Arise! Arise, the great surf from Kahiki! Come, break, deep blue sea, the long heavy surf!"
"O ka nalu kui lua ka ianei ike ana aku i ka haa mai, o ko ianei pae mai la no ia. Kau no hoi keia i ke one, ku no hoi ke poo o Kamalama i ka oo a Ohiakuikalaka.

Just as he reached the sand the head of Kamalama received a blow from the digger of Ohiakuikalaka. The friend came forward and, raising him up, observed the blood trickling from the head of his bosom companion. He kissed the nose, and took him for burial. However, he looked back and saw the men closing in behind him who had come to secure his death. He buried and covered up his friend; then turned around and beheld the many men on the hill, and observed the bodies of his ulus lying scattered about, and secretly commented on the haste of them in wandering away to broader destruction. Whereupon Kawelo recited these lines of chant:"
"Ea mai ana ma Nihoa, Ma ka mole mai o Lehua, Ua iho la e ka ua pulu kahawai Pulu a’u lehua i ka makoa.","It has risen above Nihoa, From the foundation of Lehua, The rain falls, the stream is fed; My lehua is softened by the makoa rain."

He kept on, but there was no place of meeting; the men fled hastily towards, and occupied the top of the hill and very calmly began to pelt stones at him. [ ]"

He was struck, but he still pressed upward. When he was covered over with stones he shook and they all fell [off]. Still he ascended. Reaching the summit, there were only two piles of stones left, when he was held down by the many stones on top of him, and he lay back quite dead. Kawelo was then picked up, conveyed to and placed on a structure already prepared. Then the king asked for one to act as guard until the bones were loosened, whence they would be stripped. At this moment the half-sister of Kawelo heard [it] and said to the king: “It is well that I be caretaker,” to which the king assented, and they all returned feeling assured there was no mischiefmaker left to cause trouble again, that the tyrant had been killed, and the comparative ease of living had come and slumber was undisturbed during the night."

[ ]","When Kawelo had been placed on the frame of the structure, those who were to keep watch over the corpse of Kawelo retired and rested a few days, because they were much exhausted from the previous encounter. But before Kawelo had been placed on the platform of the structure, he was wrapped up. The manner of its preparation was like the rolling up of a tobacco bundle, though not exactly, for he was laid out at full length and placed on top. The rope with which it was fastened was wauke rope. The king, Aikanaka, had previously instructed the guards, who were the sister and the brother-in-law of Kawelo, saying: “Whilst he remains on the platform of the structure, this is my behest to you two: Take good care of the corpse of the deceased until two ten-day periods have gone by, when I will know that the body of the chief has become decayed. I shall dispatch a messenger hither to make inquiries concerning the body of Kawelo, and you will inform him.” “It is agreed,” the guards said. The king then withdrew with his men and the companion of Kawelo during his early childhood. [ ]"

They had, however, plenty of vegetable food. As to the fire they had kindled, it was obtained from one of the woods, since fire was not then commonly known. Their fire having been lighted and the kukui-nut having been cooked, they sat down to eat; after which they laid down to sleep. They heard the thump of the bundle, and though they thought that its occupant was dead, yet it was still living. The wife said to the husband: “Go over and examine your brother-in-law; perhaps the rope has given way.” The husband replied, “Maybe it is a ghost; I am afraid.” The wife spoke: “You just simply go and peep, and then come back.” “All right,” the husband answered."
"O ka hele aku la no ia o ke kane me ka haalulu no ka makau a kiei.

Ua ola oia nei.” Hele mai la kela a lomi pu iho la.","Whereupon the husband ventured, trembling on account of fear, and peeped in. But to his amazement, the corpse was shaking about in the covering, and the husband exclaimed to his wife: “Say, he is a ghost, for he is here shaking!” The wife ran over and, noticing it tremble, said to the husband: “Disengage him, you who have strong hands, and examine his injuries.” The husband unfastened it, but the wife had withdrawn, and he saw the body of Kawelo trembling. If the brother-in-law had perhaps then killed him, Kawelo would then have been forever done with! Not so! Pity possessed him, and [he] called to his wife: “Say, you! Come hither and let us give him treatment. He is alive.” The other responded and both massaged him."
"I ko laua nei nana iho nae, ua ano okoa ka ili: he eleele, a he ulaula. O ka kumu paha o ka eleele, no ka pa mau i ka pohaku.

Perhaps the reason for the blackness was because of the continuous bruisings by the stones. Nevertheless, Kawelo was lifted and conveyed to the place they had started the fire, massaged and also warmed up near the fire; and they were up until midnight. Then the body of Kawelo gradually came out of that state of syncope, and he saw the others. He was assisted and sat up, though he was very feeble; he saluted and the others did likewise. After they had spent a sleepless night, and somewhere between daybreak and the approach of daylight, they noticed that the body of Kawelo was slowly recovering. It was not like that before in excessive darkness of color. He had resumed his usual appearance."
"Olelo aku o ua Kawelo: “O olua wale no nae paha kai luna nei e kiai ai ia’u. Aohe he mea e?” Hai mai ka wahine: “Ae, o maua wale no.

Is there no one else?” The woman replied: “Yes, we are alone. I never thought of watching over you, but it became necessary since I saw that you were of my blood, because the older brother of my father is your father. Therefore, my pity for you welled up, and I besought the king that I keep watch until you decomposed, when you were to be sent for and your bones stripped.” Kawelo spoke on: “Was there no [ ] other instruction of the king to you?” The former answered: “There was instruction indeed. This is his behest; that we should watch over you until two ten-day periods elapsed, when he would send a man hither who was to be informed by us of your state, and he was to return and report to the king, who would then come up and strip all your bones.”"
"Olelo aku o Kawelo: “Ehia anahulu i koe, alaila pii mai kekahi o lakou e nana?” “Eha no la i koe, alaila pii mai.” Olelo iho keia i ke kaikoeke e huki mai ke alahaka iluna, nokamea, o kahi ia i waiho ia ai ke kino o Kawelo.

It was on a hill, all the points of which were unscalable by men, because it was steep on all sides, and only by way of this ladder could those who desired to inspect this hill reach it. Immediately the ladder was drawn up and placed on the top; Kawelo said: “Listen! If in the course of staying, one from below should be sent hither, and should call out to let down the ladder, do not consent. Instead, say to him that only with strength can the top be reached.” “It is agreed,” the brother-in-law replied."
"Ko lakou nei noho iho la no ia a hala na la eha. I ka lima o ka la ua hiamoe aku la nae ua Kawelo nei, ike aku la ke kaikoekoe i ke kanaka o ka pii ana mai, o ko ianei uwe iho la no ia.

E hoi au a olelo aku, aole e loaa aku ke kino kupapau o Kawelo, aia a me ke ikaika, alaila loaa.”","They lived on and four days passed by. On the fifth day Kawelo, however, being asleep, the brother-in-law espied the man who had come up and began to weep. When the wife heard the wailing of the husband, she said: “What are these tears for?” The other answered: “Why question you regarding these tears; they are for death. Ill-fate will soon come.” Not very long afterwards, the one that had been sent to inquire after the corpse of the deceased called out: “Lower the ladder that I may ascend to examine the body of the dead one.” The other replied with fear: “The ladder will not be lowered for you. Only with the greatest strength can the top be inspected.” The man replied: “Whence, indeed, is that power of resistance of yours? I supposed you were stationed to care for the corpse, but lo! you two are placed to resist. What of it, anyhow? I am going back and report this action of yours to the king; I will explain that the corpse of Kawelo cannot be obtained, except only with force shall it be secured.”"

Indeed, as I set out thither and arrived at the foot of the hill, I called out for the ladder to be lowered, but the others did not let it down. Instead, he asserted that it would not be lowered, and that only with force can we reach thereon. That is what [ ] he told me.” The king spoke up: “Go and muster the men together to capture and beat them until dead, then drag them hither.” “All right,” said the man. He then ran out merrily and approached before the men, who said: “Wherefore came you here?” “The king has commanded me that we go and slay those who kept watch over the corpse of Kawelo, and who have rebelled.” They immediately prepared and were well equipped."
"Mamua nae o ka makaukau ana o na kanaka e pii, olelo aku ka wahine, o Kanewahineikiaoha, ia Aikanaka: “Aole kakou e pakele; e pau ana kakou i ka make ia Kawelo.

I told you frequently that if my husband should survive from this death, then we would perish.” The husband said: “Will he that is dead come to life? maybe his flesh has become soft; perhaps it has reduced to nothingness.” “It may be so,” the wife answered; “it is not clear.” In due time the man urged that they go up and kill those two persons. However, the friend, who was the bosom companion of his early childhood, preceded the band."

And when Kawelo saw it he asked: “Wherefore is this weeping?” The other answered: “It is a death wailing. The company is on its way to capture me.” “You retire then to the rear, and let me move forward.” The brother-in-law retired to the rear; Kawelo gradually moved towards, and had just gained the edge of the hill, when the company stood directly below it, and his friend called out: “Lower the ladder that we may be able to ascend.” The former whispered to the brother-in-law, “Say, let the ladder down!” It was nothing; so the ladder was dropped to the ground. Immediately his friend with his warriors began to climb up. He looked, and, catching sight of the friend, his tears rolled down; he recited that chant which they had once before composed:"
"O ka pua o ka lehua ka’u aloha Ke hoomae ia mai la e ka la Ike mai la ia Huliamahi Ke lia wale ’la no ka io E aloha oe! Aloha ko kaua holoholo pu ana, Aloha ka nalu hee o Wailua, Elua kaua i ka ai hookahi a ka makua.",I love the blossom of the lehua Which is being wilted by the sun And which espies Huliamahi. The flesh is just trembling. Farewell to you! Farewell to our companionship! Farewell to the surf of Wailua! We two were fondled together by the same parent.

He shrank back, thinking perhaps that he would escape. The soldiers said: “Why the drawing back, for what?” “ Why not ascend and capture and drag yonder quiet fellow hither?” Their leader answered: “We shall not escape; we will all be vanquished. That is Kawelo sleeping over there. What a great pity it would be that my intestines be allowed to trail down from the tree; while you are simply slain, and your entrails are not taken out.” The men [ ] said: “Who is indeed the Kawelo that should survive from an everlasting death? Maybe you mistook the man for Kawelo.” “No, that is Kawelo, indeed.”"
"Ia manawa ku aku ua wahi kaikoeke nei o Kawelo a olelo haanui aku: “Hookahi wale no o oukou pakele ia’u, he hoi aku no oukou.

[ ]","At this moment, the brother-in-law of Kawelo advanced and said triumphantly: “There is only one way you will be spared by me —that you return. But if you persist on coming up here, you will all be killed and no informant shall escape to the king.” The men were very much irritated. As they were coming up, he took hold of a boulder and began to roll it. As the boulder rolled down ten were swept away. Then the man ran and crouched behind Kawelo. Kawelo stood forth with unequalled strength and started to sweep them down, when they all fled away. Kawelo began to slay them except one who hied to the presence of the king. “What brings you hither?” the king demanded. “You are justified in asking. We are all vanquished by Kawelo, and I only am left. Perhaps I was allowed to escape to inform you. The majority are all destroyed.” [ INCOMPLETE. ] D. Kamakea. [ ]"
"Omaihuna ka makuakane, o Malaiakalani ka makuahine, o Hanamaulu i Kauai ka aina hanau o Kawelo.

There were five children in the family. The first was Kawelomahamahaia; the second was Kaweloleikoo. These two were males; after these two came Kaenakuokalani, a female; next to her was Kaweloleimakua and the last child was Kamalama. Kaweloleimakua, or Kawelo is the subject of this story."
"O na makua o Malaiakalani, he mau mea akamai laua i ka haha a me ka nana i ka wa uuku o ke keiki, aole e nalo ia laua ke ano a me ka hana a ke keiki ke nui ae, ke koa a me ka ikaika, ke keiki ku i ka moku.

Mahope o laila, hanau o Kamalama ko Kawelo kaikaina ponoi.","The parents of Malaiakalani [the mother] were people who were well versed in the art of foretelling the future of a child, by feeling of its limbs, and by looking over the child, they could tell whether it would grow up to be brave and strong, or whether it would some day rule as king. At the birth of the two older brothers of Kawelo, these old people examined them, but found nothing wonderful about them. This examination was followed by the two on Kawelo, upon his birth. After the examination the old people called the parents of Kawelo and said to them: “Where are you two? This child of yours is going to be a soldier; he is going to be a very powerful man and shall some day rule as king.” Because of these wonderful traits, the old people took Kawelo and attended to his bringing up themselves. It was after this that Kamalama, the younger brother of Kawelo was born."
"Mahope o laila, hoi ae la na kupuna o Kawelo i Wailua e noho ai, me ka laua moopuna o Kawelo.

At this time, while Kawelo was being brought up, Aikanaka, the son of the king of Kauai was born, and also Kauahoa of Hanalei. All these three were born and brought up together."
"He keiki ikaika loa o Kawelo ma ka ai ana, hookahi umu hookahi ai ana, pela aku, a pela aku, a ana na kupuna o Kawelo, i ke kahumu ai na Kawelo, nolaila, imi iho la laua i mea e walea ai o Kawelo.

Kawelo ate so much that his grandparents began to get tired of keeping him in food, so at last they began to search for something to entice Kawelo away from the house and in that way get him to forget to eat. One day they went up to the woods and hewed out a canoe. After it was brought down to the sea shore it was rigged up and given to Kawelo. As soon as Kawelo got the canoe he paddled it up and down the Wailua river, and after this it became an object of great interest to him every day."
"Ma keia hana a Kawelo, ike mai la o Kauahoa i ka Kawelo mea nanea, he waa, hana iho la ia i lupe hoolele nana, a hoolele ae la, a ike o Kawelo i keia mea, [ ] makemake iho la ia, hoi aku la olelo i na kupuna e hana i lupe nana.

When Kawelo saw the kite he took a liking to it and so went home to his grandparents and requested them to make him a kite. The grandparents thereupon made Kawelo a kite and after it was completed he took it out and flew it up. When Kauahoa saw Kawelo with a kite he came with his and they flew them together. While they were flying their kites, Kawelo’s kite became entangled with Kauahoa’s kite which caused Kauahoa’s to break away and it was carried by the wind till it landed at Koloa, to the west. The name of the place where the kite landed is known as Kahooleinapea to this day, because of the fall of Kauahoa’s kite there."
"Ma keia moku ana o ka lupe a Kauahoa ia Kawelo, nana aku la o Kawelo i ko Kauahoa kii mai e pepehi ia ia, a liuliu, noonoo iho la o Kawelo, aole no e pakele o Kauahoa ia ia, ina laua e kaua mahope, no ka mea, he nui o Kauahoa, he uuku o Kawelo, aka, ua makau nae o Kauahoa ia Kawelo.","After Kauahoa’s kite was broken away, Kawelo looked at Kauahoa with the belief that surely Kauahoa would come and attack him; but since Kauahoa did not come Kawelo said within himself: “Kauahoa will never overcome me if we should ever meet in any future battle.” Kauahoa was a much larger boy than Kawelo, still he was afraid of him."
"A mahope o ka hoolele lupe, hookahekahe wai iho la laua, a oi aku la no ko Kawelo i mua o Kauahoa, nolaila, noonoo iho la no o Kawelo, aole no e pakele o Kauahoa ia ia mahope aku ke kaua. O Kawelo a me Kauahoa, aole laua i kaawale aku, ua pili no ma ka hanau ana, a pela no ke ’lii o Aikanaka, ua pili no ia laua, nolaila, lilo o Aikanaka i kaikuaana haku no laua. Ma na mea a pau a Aikanaka e olelo mai ai, malaila laua e hoolohe ai, ina he kui lei, a he mea e ae paha, aole a laua hoole, he ae wale no.","After flying their kites, they went in swimming and riding down the rapids. In this Kawelo again showed himself to be more skilful than Kauahoa, which caused Kawelo to be more sure in his belief that Kauahoa will never overcome him in the future. Kawelo and Kauahoa were not separated from one another in the matter of their relationship; they were connected, and so was the young chief, Aikanaka. He was connected in blood to the two boys, a fact which made Aikanaka something like an older brother and lord to them. Everything Aikanaka wished was granted to him, whether in stringing wreaths, or other things, they never denied him anything."
"Ia Kawelo ma e noho ana i Wailua me Aikanaka ma, holo mai la na kaikuaana o Kawelo me ko laua mau kupuna, mai Kauai mai a noho i Waikiki ma Oahu nei. O Kakuhihewa ke ’lii o Oahu nei e noho ana ia wa, a aia hoi me Kakuhihewa, he kanaka ikaika loa i ka mokomoko.

Kakuhihewa was the king of Oahu at this time. There was living with Kakuhihewa, a very strong man who was a famous wrestler. This man used to meet the older brothers of Kawelo in several wrestling bouts but they never could throw him down. The brothers of Kawelo were great surf riders, and they often went to ride the surf at Kalehuawehe. After the surf ride they would go to the stream of Apuakehau and wash, and from there they would go to the shed where the wrestling bouts were held and test their skill with Kakuhihewa’s strong man; but in all their trials they never once were able to throw him."
"Ma keia noho kaawale ana o na kaikuaana o Kawelo i Oahu nei, hu ae la ke aloha i na kupuna o lakou e noho ana me Kawelo i Wailua, nolaila, holo mai la na kupuna me Kawelo i Oahu nei, a pae ma Waikiki, ike iho la i na kaikuaana, a noho iho la i laila.

After deciding to make their home in Waikiki, Kawelo took up farming and also took unto himself a wife, Kanewahineikiaoha, the daughter of Kalonaikahailaau, and they lived together as husband and wife."
"Ia Kawelo e mahiai ana, lohe aku la ia i ka pihe uwa o kai, uwa ka pihe a [ ] haalele wale, alaila, ninau aku o Kawelo i na kupuna: “Heaha kela pihe o kai e uwa mai nei?” I mai la na kupuna: “Ou kaikuaana; hele aku la i ka heenalu, a hoi mai la mokomoko me ke kanaka ikaika o Kakuhihewa, a hina iho la kekahi, uwa ae la, a nolaila, kela pihe au e lohe la i ka uwa.” A lohe o Kawelo, olioli iho la ia e iho e ike, aka, aohe ae o na kupuna ona, nolaila, i kekahi la, iho aku la o Kawelo ma kona manao a hiki i kai, e heenalu ana na kaikuaana a me ka lehulehu i ka nalu o Kalehuawehe.

Ia manawa hoomakaukau o Kawelo i kana olelo hooulu, a i ko Kawelo kulai ana hina iho la ia ia a kau iho la o Kawelo maluna, a uwa ae la na kanaka a pau loa.","While Kawelo was one day working in his fields, he heard some shouting down [ ] toward the beach, so he inquired of his grandparents: “What is that shouting down yonder?” The grandparents answered: “It is your brothers; they have been out surf riding and are now wrestling with Kakuhihewa’s strong man. One of them must have been thrown, hence the shouting you hear.” When Kawelo heard this he became very anxious to go down and see it; but his grandparents would not consent. On the next day, however, Kawelo went down on his own account and saw his older brothers surf riding with many others at Kalehuawehe. He asked for a board which was given him and he swam out with it to where his brothers were waiting for the surf, and they came in together. After the surf riding, they went to the stream of Apuakehau and took a fresh water bath; and from there they went to the shed where the wrestling bouts were to be held. Upon their arrival at the shed Kawelo stood up with the strong man to wrestle. At sight of this Kawelo’s older brothers said to him: “Are you strong enough to meet that man? If we whose bones are older cannot throw him, how much less are the chances of yourself, a mere youngster.” Kawelo, however, paid no heed to the remarks made by his brothers, but stood there facing the strong man. At this show of bravery the strong man said to Kawelo: “If I should call out, ‘Kahewahewa, it is raining’, then we begin.” Kawelo then replied in a mocking way: “Kanepuaa, he is biting, wait awhile, wait awhile. Don’t cut the land of Kahewahewa, it is raining.” While Kawelo was having his say, the strong man of Kakuhihewa was awarded the privilege of taking the first hold; and using his whole strength he attempted to throw Kawelo. Kawelo was almost thrown, but through his great strength and skill he was not. Kawelo, after mocking the man, took his hold and threw the strong man, who was thrown with Kawelo on top of him. This delighted the people so much that they all shouted."
"A ike na kaikuaana o Kawelo, i ka hina ana o ke kanaka ikaika i ko laua kaikaina, hilahila iho la laua, a hoi aku la i ka hale me na olelo hoopunipuni i na kupuna, me ka uwe, a me ka waimaka.

Mahope o laila, ao o Kawelo i ka hula, a o ka loaa ole o ia, haalele o Kawelo ia mea, a ao iho la i ke kaua me kona makuahunowai me Kalonaikahailaau; ao iho la no hoi o Kamalama, a me Kanewahineikiaoha. A pau ke ao ana i ke kaua, ao iho la o Kawelo i ka lawaia. O Maakuakeke he kumu lawaia a Kawelo, no Waialae.","When the older brothers of Kawelo saw how the strong man was thrown by their younger brother they were ashamed, and they returned home weeping and tried to deceive their grandparents. When they arrived at the house the grandparents asked them: “Why these tears?” They replied: “Kawelo threw stones at us. We are therefore going back to Kauai.” After the brothers of Kawelo had returned to Kauai, Kawelo and his wife and younger brother Kamalama lived on at Waikiki. Not very long after this Kawelo began to learn dancing, but being unable to master this he dropped it and took up the art of war under the instruction of his father-in-law, Kalonaikahailaau. Kamalama also took up this art as well as Kanewahineikiaoha. After Kawelo had mastered the art of warfare, he took up fishing. Maakuakeke of Waialae was the fishing instructor of Kawelo."
"I ke kakahiaka nui, ala ae la o Kawelo a hele aku la mai Waikiki aku, a Kaluahole, Kaalawai, hiki i Waialae, paha aku la o Kawelo penei:","Early in the morning Kawelo would get up and start out from Waikiki going by way of Kaluahole, Kaalawai, and so on to Waialae where he would chant out:"
"E Maakuakeke, Hoa lawaia o Kawelo nei la, E ala , ua ao, ua malamalama, [ ] Ua hiki ka la aia i luna; Lawe mai na kihele makau, Me ka ipu holoholona pu mai, Me ka upena mai a kaua; E Maakuakeke, Ka hoe nakeke, Ke kuapoi nakeke, Ke ka nakeke, e ala ua ao.","Say, Maakuakeke, Fishing companion of Kawelo, Wake up, it is daylight, the sun is shining, [ ] The sun has risen, it is up. Bring along our hooks Together with the fishing kit As well as our net. Say, Maakuakeke, The rattling paddles, The rattling top covering, The rattling bailing cup, wake up, it is daylight."
"Ma keia paha a Kawelo, lohe ka wahine a Maakuakeke, hoala aku la i kana kane: “E, e ala, aole au i lohe i ka lealea o ko inoa i kou mau kupuna, aole hoi i na makua, a ia Kawelo akahi no au a lohe i ka lea o kou inoa.” Ala ae la o Maakuakeke, hoomakaukau i na mea a pau a Kawelo i kahea mai ai, hele aku la a kau i luna o ka waa, a holo aku la laua. Ia laua e holo ana, kahea mai o Maakuakeke ia Kawelo, penei:","While Kawelo was chanting, Maakuakeke’s wife heard it, so she woke her husband up saying: “Wake up, I never heard your grandparents chant your name so pleasingly as has Kawelo this morning. No, not even your parents. This is the first time that I have heard such a pleasing chant.” Maakuakeke then woke up, made ready everything called out by Kawelo in the chant, went out, boarded the canoe and they set out. As they were going along, Maakuakeke called out to Kawelo in a chant as follows:"
"E Kawelo-lei-makua, e pae, E kama hana a ka lapa o Puna, Na maka o Haloa i luna, Kuu haku, kuu lawaia alii o Kauai.","Say, Kawelo-lei-makua, stop. Say, offspring of the cliffs of Puna, The eyes of Haloa are above, My lord, my chiefly fisherman of Kauai."
"Olelo mai o Maakuakeke ia Kawelo: “Eia no ko makou wahi e lawaia ai, loaa no ka ia hoi aku i uka, o ka wahine, o ke keiki.” I aku o Kawelo: “Aole keia o ka ia; aia kahi o ka ia, o ka lae o Kaena.” I hou aku o Kawelo ia Maakuakeke: “E noho a paa i luna o ka waa, o kulana.” Hookahi no mapuna hoe a Kawelo, hele ana laua ma waho o Mamala, i ka lua o ka mapuna hoe, komo i Puuloa, i ke kolu, komo i Waianae.

The place for fish is at the cape of Kaena.” Kawelo also told Maakuakeke to sit securely in the canoe, lest he might be pitched over. With one stroke of the paddle by Kawelo, they passed outside of Mamala; with the second stroke they were at Puuloa; and on the third stroke they arrived at Waianae. When they arrived off Waianae, Kawelo picked up the kukui nuts, chewed them and then blew it on the sea to calm it, so that the bottom could be seen, as they were fishing for the uhu . They fished from shallow to deep water and caught a number of fishes. On this going out into deep water, Maakuakeke knew that they would come to the place of Uhumakaikai (a marvelous fish); therefore Maakuakeke said to Kawelo in chant, as follows:"
"E Kawelo-lei-makua, e pae, E kama huna a kala o Puna, Na maka o Haloa i luna, Kuu haku, kuu lawaia alii o Kauai.","O Kaweloleimakua, hearken! O offspring of the cliffs of Puna! The eyes of Haloa are above, My lord, my chiefly fisherman of Kauai."

Kawelo then took up two uhus, one for Kamalama and one for his wife, Kanewahineikiaoha, and he came on home to Waikiki. Upon his arrival, he entered the Apuakehau stream and had a bath. After his bath, he returned to the house and then called out to his chief steward, Puikikaulehua, for food and meat. The chief steward then brought forty calabashes of poi and forty small packages of baked pork and placed them before Kawelo, who then began his meal. But these were not sufficient, and he again called for some more. The chief steward again brought the same quantity as before, which amount satisfied his hunger."
"A kokoke ka la e napoo i lalo o ka ilikai, kahea aku la ia i ka wahine, ia Kanewahineikiaoha:","As the sun was nearing the horizon, Kawelo would then call to his wife, Kanewahineikiaoha, as follows:"

Consumed, for Kauai is consumed by fire! Consumed, for Haupu is consumed by fire! Consumed, for Kalanipuu is consumed by fire! Consumed, for Kalalea is consumed by fire! Consumed, for Kahiki is consumed by fire! Consumed, for the eel has ceased moving, being consumed by the fire! For love has brought the fond remembrance Of Maihuna, parent of Kawelo; Possibly my parents are dead."
"I mai o Kanewahineikiaoha ia Kawelo: “Emoole oe e Kawelo i holo aku nei i Kauai a hoi mai nei, a ike i ka make ou mau makua.” Ia wa paha hou o Kawelo, penei:","Kanewahineikiaoha then replied to Kawelo: “How quickly you have gone to Kauai and back again, Kawelo, and seen that your parents are dead!” Kawelo then made reply by chanting:"
"Ina paha he make no kou makua, Kulu kou waimaka i ke aloha, Kahe la hoi kou upe i lalo, O ka make o ko ’u makua, Makua o Kawelo nei la.","If your parents were dead instead, You would weep for love of them, And the water would run from your nose. But alas, it is my parents that are dead— The parents of Kawelo."
"Moe iho la o Kawelo ia po a ao, hele hou aku la ia i Waialae i kana kumu lawaia ia Maakuakeke, a holo hou laua i ka lawaia.","Kawelo slept that night until daylight, when he again set out for Waialae to his instructor in the art of fishing, Maakuakeke, and they again set out on a fishing cruise."
"Ma keia holo ana, hiki laua i ka lae o Kaena, ma Waianae.

Upon arriving at this fishing ground, they immediately began fishing; and in a short time Kawelo got so busy pulling up the uhu that they were overtaken by a rain and wind-storm. When Maakuakeke saw the storm, he urged upon Kawelo to return, for he knew [ ] that when the rain and wind are encountered, that it was the sure sign of the coming of Uhumakaikai. Knowing this, he urged upon Kawelo to return, but Kawelo would not consent to it. Kawelo, on the other hand, knew that they were to meet the great fish, Uhumakaikai, so he insisted on looking down at the bottom of the sea and blowing chewed kukui nut over the surface of the sea. While he was busily doing this, Uhumakaikai passed by. When Kawelo saw it, he reached for his net and made ready to catch the great fish. As Uhumakaikai came nearer, he was caught in the net and immediately they were towed out to mid-ocean by this fish. When they looked behind them, they saw that the houses and the line of surf at Waianae had disappeared. At seeing this Maakuakeke called out to Kawelo:"
"E Kaweloleimakua, E pae e. E kama hanau a ka lapa o Puna, Na maka o Haloa i luna, Kuu haku kuu lawaia alii o Kauai.","Say, Kaweloleimakua, Let us land. Say, offspring of the cliffs of Puna, The eyes of Haloa are above, My lord, my chiefly fisherman of Kauai."

As the sea was coming in over the sides of the canoe, for they were traveling at a very great rate of speed, Kawelo laid down over the open canoe and in this way kept out the sea from entering it. When next Maakuakeke looked behind, he saw that Oahu had disappeared, and he began to fear death."
"Ma keia ahai ana a Uhumakaikai ia po a ao ae, hoea mai laua ma ka mole mai o Niihau, o Manawaikeao ia wahi, malaila mai laua a waho o Hulaia i Kauai.

When they reached there Maakuakeke said to Kawelo: “Say, there is a large land above us. What land is it?” Kawelo replied: “It is Kauai.” Maakuakeke again said to Kawelo: “If after this we should ever come and make war on Kauai and should win, let me have Kapaa as my land.” Kawelo replied: “It shall be yours.” They continued on until they were off Hanalei, when Maakuakeke again inquired: “What land is this?” Kawelo replied: “It is Hanalei.” Maakuakeke again asked: “Let me also own Hanalei.” After this they turned and made for Oahu, and Maakuakeke began to think that they were safe. On nearing the place where Uhumakaikai was caught in the net, Kawelo stood up and prayed as follows:"

Let the rain return to the eyes of the lehua, Let the small pointed clouds return to Kahiki Where they shall indeed remain."
"A pau ka pule a Kawelo, unuhi ae ia ia Uhumakaikai mai ke kai ae, ua make i ka pule a Kawelo. A paa ua ia nei o Uhumakaikai, hoopili mai la o Kawelo ma ka aoao o ka waa, mai mua a hope i ua ia nei.","At the close of the prayer offered by Kawelo, he pulled Uhumakaikai out of the sea; it was dead by his prayer. After Kawelo had caught hold of the great fish, he pulled it along the side of the canoe and it extended from the bow to the stern."
"I ka wa i make ai o Uhumakaikai, hiki mai la na elele kii o Kawelo mai Kauai mai, na kona kaikuahine i hoouna mai.

They had been sent by the sister of Kawelo—they were Kaweloikiakoo and Kooakapoko—to bring Kawelo to Kauai, because the great strength of Kawelo had become famous all over Kauai, and it was thought that with this strength a successful war could be waged against Aikanaka, who had taken unto himself all the lands owned by the parents of Kawelo at Hanamaulu. When Aikanaka took possession of the lands, he left them without land to cultivate or sea to fish in; in fact, they were left destitute. Their one food was head lice and nits."

Reaching mid-channel of Kaieiewaho, between Kauai and Oahu, they took up their lice and ate them. In eating their meal, they forgot to offer them first to the god, consequently, shortly after they had finished eating, they were overtaken by a severe storm, which greatly delayed them. Early the next morning, they began to study the cause of this storm, and they found that it was because they had neglected the god when they partook of their evening meal, so they sued for forgiveness by offering the following prayer:"
"O akahi ka po, o alua ka po, O akolu ka po, o aha ka po, O alima ka po, o aono ka po, O ahiku ka po, o awalu ka po, O aiwa ka po, lele wale ka po.","Of the first night, of the second night, Of the third night, of the fourth night, Of the fifth night, of the sixth night, Of the seventh night, of the eighth night, Of the ninth night, the nights are all gone."

[ ] Early the next day, they saw the top of the Kaala mountain, and they felt assured of their arrival in Oahu. That morning, before the heat of the sun could be felt, they landed at Waikiki. Upon their arrival, they met Kamalama and asked for Kawelo. Kamalama replied: “He has gone out fishing and has been away all of yesterday and all of last night and has not yet returned.” The messengers then said to Kamalama: “We have come for him, for his parents are about to die from starvation, their only food being head lice and nits, for Aikanaka has taken away all their lands in Hanamaulu, all the food and the fish and they are without anything. We have therefore come for Kawelo to go to Kauai.” Kamalama then sent two certain men, Kalohipikonui and Kalohipikoikipuwaawaa, to go for Kawelo. These two were very loud-voiced men; if they called from Waikiki, they could be heard at Ewa; and if they called from Ewa, they could be heard at Waianae. It was because of this that these two men were sent by Kamalama to go for Kawelo. Before they started out, Kamalama instructed them saying: “You two must remember the names of these two men from Kauai, so that in case Kawelo should ask you who they are you would be able to tell him their names. When you see Kawelo, keep at some distance away from him and then inform him of your errand; don’t on any account get near him.”"
"Ia laua i holo ai, kahuli iho la laua, a lilo iho la laua i ke ka, i ka hoe, pela laua i apa ai, a poina iho la ka inoa o ua mau kanaka ala o Kauai mai.

When they at last saw Kawelo, they called out: “Say, Kawelo, your uncles have arrived from Kauai.” Kawelo asked: “Who are they?” They replied: “We were told their names, but on our way we were overturned and in righting our canoe, and, in the bailing and paddling of it, we forgot their names. But you know they are your uncles, and you can think for yourself who they are, for we are going back.” At this Kawelo answered by a chant as follows:"
"Holo ana nae hoi o Hikiula, O Hikikea i kepakepa o ka waa, Ohiki eli i kona lua, Aama holo i ka maloo, Paiea noho i ka mawae, Ka ula noho i ka naele, Ka puhi lapa i ke ale, Opule kai i ka lauli, Keke ka niho o ka halahala, Aloha mai nei Auau o Apehe, Na hoa noho o Ulalena e, Ku ana hoi kuu houpo e laua la, I ka wa kamalii—e. He mea e ka pili—e.","Hikiula is however sailing off, With Hikikea, as the canoe sails on its way. The Ohiki digs its own hole, The aama runs on the dry land, The paiea lives in the cracks, The lobster lives in a large hole, The eel plays on the waves, The opule fish go in schools on a cloudy day. The teeth of the halahala fish show like a cross dog. I now fondly remember of Auau, of Apehe, My companions of Ulalena; For my breast is beating, ye two, As I remember of our childhood days. O, how close we were in those days! [ ]"
"I aku ua mau wahi kanaka nei: “Aohe inoa aa, he inoa okoa iho no.” Paha hou mai ana o Kawelo, penei:",The two men then said: “There was nothing like aa in their names; the names sounded differently.” Kawelo then chanted again as follows:
"Ku Kila i ke ahiahi, Moe ka puaa aaua, Kaumaha i ke ’kua ia Kaneikapualena, Akua mana o kuu kupunakane, Make ka ua me ka makani, Make ke kaikoo me ke kai pii, Holo aku la i ka moana, He uku ke o o na elele, O Kaweloikiakoo, o Koapoko, Muli o Malaia kuu makuahine, O laua nae paha kai uka—e.","Kila arrived in the evening; The thin pig was killed, And sacrifices were offered to Kaneikapualena The all powerful god of my grandfather. The rain and the wind ceased, Which calmed the raging sea and the rising tide. They sailed out to sea. The messengers had crabs for their food, Kaweloikiakoo and Kooakapoko, Younger brothers of my mother. Are they the ones that arrived?"
"Ae aku la ua mau wahi kanaka nei: “Ae, o ka inoa ia ou mau makua, a me ko akua pu no hoi, o Kulanihehu.” No ka olelo ana aku a laua i ke ’kua, huhu loa o Kawelo, a manao iho la e pepehi ia laua a make, i loaa ke kanaka a ke ’kua ona.

He therefore chased after them, and they were almost caught, when they pointed their canoes and made for the shoals within the line of breakers along the Waianae coast. When Kawelo saw this, he followed right along behind the two. In doing this, Kawelo forgot about his fish and it got stranded, so he made again for deep water. While he was doing this, the two men arrived at Waikiki, where they told of their narrow escape from death. Kamalama then said: “I warned you not to get too near to him.” While they were talking, Kawelo, Maakuakeke and the great fish arrived; and Uhumakaikai was put ashore. As Kawelo landed, Kauluiki, Kaulunui, Kauluwaho, Kaulukauloko, Kauluikialaalaa, Kauluaiole and Kaulupamakani, came up all armed with their spears. These men were very skilful in the use of the spear. When they came up to Kawelo, they began throwing their spears at him, which Kawelo warded off, for they were as mere playthings to him. When the men were throwing their spears at Kawelo, the messengers from Kauai said to Kawelo: “Say, you will surely get hit and be killed, and you will not be able to get to Kauai.” Kamalama replied: “They are but as a bath to him.”"
"Ia wa, ku mai la o Kaeleha laua o Kalaumeki, a hou i ka laua mau ihe ia Kawelo, a pau ka laua o ana, kahea aku la o Kawelo ia Kamalama ma ka paha penei:","After this Kaeleha and Kalaumeki came up and threw their spears at Kawelo. After they were through, Kawelo called out to Kamalama in a chant as follows:"
"E Kamalama iki, Kuu pokii e, kuu pokii, Lawe ia mai na wahi ihe Kuku ooi a kaua.","Say, little Kamalama, My younger brother, my younger brother, Bring out our small spears, Our sharp pointed ones."
"Lalau iho la o Kamalama ia Kapuaokekau a me Kapuaokahooilo, he mau ihe laua. I aku o Kamalama ia Kawelo: [ ]","Kamalama then picked out Kapuaokekau and Kapuaokahooilo, two spears, and said to Kawelo: [ ]"
"Elieli iho la kulana o Kamalama, a hou aku la i ka ihe ia Kawelo. I ka hou ana o ka ihe ia Kawelo, pa aku la i ka umauma, lele ae la i luna a haule aku la i kuaau ma waho loa, hopu hou o Kamalama i ka lua o ka ihe, a hou ia Kawelo, alaila, paha mai o Kawelo, penei:","Kamalama then poised himself with firmness and threw a spear at Kawelo. At this throw, the spear struck the breast of Kawelo glancingly, and it flew up and into the sea beyond the further line of breakers. Kamalama then took up the second spear and threw it at Kawelo, when Kawelo chanted forth:"
"Welelau lua ana ka ihe a Kamalama i kuu piko, He aina aku paha ka hope e.",The points of the spears of Kamalama passed very near to my navel; Perchance it is the sign of land possession.
"A pau ka oo ihe ana, hele aku la o Kawelo e auau i ka muliwai o Apuakehau, a pau ka auau ana, hoi mai la a ka hale, kena aku la i ka aipuupuu ana ia Puikikaulelehua, e lawe mai i ai, i ia.

The chief steward then brought him forty calabashes of poi and forty packages of baked pork, and Kawelo began his meal. But this did not satisfy him, so another like amount was brought, which at last satisfied him."
"A pau ka ai ana, ninau aku o Kawelo i na makuakane mai Kauai mai: “Heaha ka olua huakai o ka hiki ana mai i Oahu nei?” I mai na makuakane: “I kii mai nei maua ia oe, aia ou mau makua la, ua kipaku ia a noho i kahi e, aohe ai, aohe ia, hookahi ai o ka uku a me ka lia o ke poo. No ke kukui o ko ikaika i Kauai, nolaila, kauoha mai nei ou makua ia oe e holo oe e kaua me Aikanaka, oia maua i kii mai la ia oe, e holo kakou.”","After this meal, Kawelo turned and asked of his two uncles from Kauai: “What has brought you here to Oahu?” The uncles answered: “We have come for you. Your parents have been driven away to a different place, having neither food nor fish. Their one food is head lice and nits. As your strength has been voiced all over Kauai, your parents have sent us to come and request of you to go and make war on Aikanaka. That is the mission that has brought us here. Let us therefore sail.”"
"A lohe o Kawelo i keia olelo a na elele o Kauai mai, kahea aku la ia i kana wahine, ia Kanewahineikiaoha, e kii i kekahi hauna laau a ko laua makuakane i Koolau, a Kalonaikahailaau. “O ka hauna laau o Wahieloa kau e nonoi aku.” Ae mai la o Kanewahineikiaoha.

He said: “Go and ask for the stroke called Wahieloa.” Kanewahineikiaoha consented to do this. Kawelo then continued: “Also ask for the bow and arrows that are used for shooting rats, and also bring the axe used for hewing out canoes, for I need them as weapons to fight Aikanaka with.” At the conclusion of Kawelo’s instructions to his wife, she started out. After she had passed by the stream of Apuakehau and the coconut grove of Kuaakaa, Kawelo then said to Kamalama: “Follow after your sister-in-law so that you will be able to hear the unkind remarks of my father-in-law.”"
"Oia ko Kawelo makuahunowai, o kana kaikamahine, o Kanewahineikiaoha, a o ka Kawelo kumu no ia nana i ao i ke kaka laau, a me na ano kaua e ae.

Kalonaikahailaau was also Kawelo’s instructor [ ] in the art of using the war club as well as the other arts of warfare. Because of the fact that Kalonaikahailaau was living in Koolau, Kawelo ordered his wife to proceed to her father’s place and request that he reveal the use of a certain stroke of the war club, also the bow and arrows used for shooting rats, and the axe used in hewing canoes."
"Ma keia hiki ana i ka hale, ua hele o Kalonaikahailaau mamua, e kapu awa ai no ke ’kua, he hale kapu ia i na wahine, aole e komo ia.

She did not see the young man on this outing. They proceeded in this manner to Nuuanu, where they were when the sun sunk below the horizon. Kanewahineikiaoha followed the winding trail down the steep cliff first while Kamalama followed a few moments later. Before she got to the house, she entered the stream and had a bath, while Kamalama hid himself outside of the house, but at a point close enough to overhear anything said in the house. When Kanewahineikiaoha entered the sleeping house, she found that her mother was all by herself, for Kalonaikahailaau was in another house kapued to the women, preparing awa for the gods. When the mother saw her daughter she sprang on her and began to wail, which was heard by the husband, and he sent a man to enquire as to the cause of the wailing. The wife then informed the man that it was their daughter, Kanewahineikiaoha. The man then returned to Kalonaikahailaau and told him that it was their daughter. When he heard this, he concluded his prayers and returned to the main house. When he met his daughter, he asked: “What is the object of my daughter’s journey in this dark night with the ghosts?” The daughter then told the father the object of the journey, saying: “I have come for a certain stroke of the war club, the one called Wahieloa, for my husband and myself, to take with us to Kauai and to use it fighting against Aikanaka.” At hearing this, Kalonaikahailaau chanted as follows:"
"E o e ku ka hauna laau a kaua, i ko kane, He kolea ko kane, he wawae liilii, He ulili ko kane, he holoholo kahakai, Paia e ke kainui, e hina wale ana no, He nui pumaia ko kane, ku ikaika, He puhala ko kane, he aakiolea, Ku no ka laau a kaua i ko makuakane, He nui no mai luna a lalo, E pa ke Kona, aole e hina, E pa ka Moae, aole e hina, He hina nou no ke aalii ku makani, akapu.","Our stroke of the war club will never do for your husband. Your husband is a plover, his legs are slim; Your husband is a sandpiper, he runs here and there on the beach; When struck by a big wave he would fall over easily; Your husband is like the stalk of the banana, all he can do is to stand up. Your husband is like a hala tree, it has long hanging roots. Our stroke of the war club is fit only for your father, Who is large from top to bottom. The south wind may blow but he will not fall over. The moae wind may blow but he will not fall over. When the aalii tree does fall it must be uprooted."

How [ ] wonderful!” The daughter said: “Nothing is hidden from the all powerful god of my husband, Kalanikilo. He has heard.” The father then again asked: “What other reason is there that has brought my daughter here in the dark with the ghosts of the midnight?” The daughter replied: “I have come for the bow and a few arrows used for rat shooting for myself and husband, for we are going to Kauai to fight Aikanaka.” On hearing this Kalonaikahailaau chanted as follows:"

He shoots the rats and then gets the food belonging to others, Then gives it to me his father-in-law. He shoots the rats and gets the food belonging to others, Then gives it to you the wife to eat. He shoots the rats and gets the food belonging to others, For Kamalama the favorite younger brother.

As soon as he was out of sight, people went out of the house to make a search, but Kamalama was not found. At dawn the next morning, Kamalama returned home, and, when he reached the top of Nuuanu pali, he looked down and saw Kanewahineikiaoha, her father, her brothers and the rest of the people coming up the road. Kamalama then turned and returned to Waikiki. On his arrival on this side of the Apuakehau stream, he was seen by Kawelo who then repeated the chant recited by his father-in-law in Koolau as follows: [ ]"

Knowing that you can hear so well, yet you sent me to that friendless place.” “I am going in to have something to eat, for I am hungry,” continued Kamalama. As soon as he got into the house, he called out to their steward, Puikikaulehua: “Bring me some food and meat.” There were brought forty large potatoes and forty packages of baked pork. Kamalama then sat down and began his meal, and he ate until he was satisfied. Just as he finished his meal, his brother’s father-in-law and wife arrived. As soon as Kawelo saw them, he repeated the chant recited by his father-in-law in Koolau. At the close of the chant Kanewahineikiaoha said to her father: “There you are: I told you that my husband was bound to hear it, because he has an all powerful god, Kalanikilo.” The father replied: “Yes, I see and I am satisfied that your husband can hear all right. The talking was carried on in Koolau and he has heard it in Kona.” Kanewahineikiaoha then said to Kawelo: “Let us have something to eat first, and after that you can exercise with the war club.” Kawelo refused, and he spoke very strongly to his wife, saying: “The pig’s intestine will be full of dirt for it is to be killed.” By this reply made by Kawelo, his father-in-law became very angry and said to Kawelo that they take up the war club first as requested by Kawelo. He then ordered his son, Mauiakekai to stand up against Kawelo. When Kawelo heard this order issued by his father-in-law that some one else was to stand up against him, he replied in a chant as follows:"
"Eia ko Kawelo manao ma keia olelo ana, he manao no kona, oia no o ka makuahunowai, no ka mea, ua ukiuki loa ia i kana mau olelo inoino ia ia. A no keia paha a Kawelo, ua piha loa o Kalonaikahailaau i ka huhu ia Kawelo, nolaila, ku ae la ia me kana laau palau, o Wahieekaeka, ka inoa. Ku lakou la ekolu, ku o Kawelo hookahi. E kakii mai ana o Kalonaikahailaau i kana laau, e hue lepo ae ana o Kawelo i kana laau, pa no ma ka aoao o Kalonaikahailaau waiho i lalo, a kapalili aku la ka manea o ka wawae, alaila, paha o Kawelo penei: [ ]","By this Kawelo meant that he would much prefer his father-in-law, for his temper was now roused over what had been said of him. Because of this chant of Kawelo, Kalonaikahailaau was also very angry at Kawelo, which made him stand up with his war club, Wahieekaeka by name. The three then stood up on one side, while Kawelo stood up on his side. Kalonaikahailaau then raised his club as though to strike Kawelo on the side, while Kawelo brought up his war club from the ground striking Kalonaikahailaau on his side knocking him down and making his feet tremble. Kawelo then chanted as follows: [ ]"
"Ke lawelawe la nae hoi, A make aku la oe ia Kuikaa, Ia Hookaa, ia Kaakua, ia Kaaalo, E ike auanei oe i ka nao hoopai a Malailua. Ka laau e wali ai ko papa auwae, E oki ai o ka nao hoopai, E ike auanei oe apopo, I ka moa i hanai ia i ka la e! A puupuu ka lepo, A akaakaa ka hulu, Me he moa kau uwahi la, A eina ka hulu, Hookahi no peku ana a ka moa-mahi, Puko ana—puko ana!","There you have felt of it; You are made unconscious by Kuikaa, By Hookaa, by Kaakua, by Kaaalo. You will surely see the avenging club of Malailua, The club that will break your jaws, For then the avenging club will cease its work. Tomorrow you shall see The rooster that is fed of the sun, Till the crop fills with dirt And the feathers fall off Like a rooster that is hung up in the smoke With its feathers burnt off. The conquering cock has made but one kick. They are scattered, they are scattered."
"Hele mai la o Kanewahineikiaoha a nini i ka wai, ia Kalonaikahailaau, a pohala ae la, alaila, olelo aku la ia Kawelo, penei: “O ka hahau ana iho la no ia o ka laau, aohe wahi i koe ia oe.”","Kanewahineikiaoha after a while came and poured some water over Kalonaikahailaau which revived him. After the effects of the blow had disappeared, he said to Kawelo: “That is the way to use your club. You have nothing more to learn.”"
"Mahope o keia, kena aku la o Kawelo ia Kamalama, Kalaumeki, Kauluiki ma, e holo i Puuloa e noi i waa ia Kakuhihewa, ke ’lii o Oahu nei ia wa. A hiki lakou i Puuloa, ninau mai o Kakuhihewa: “Heaha ka oukou?” I aku o Kanewahineikiaoha: “I kii mai nei makou i mau waa no makou.” Ninau hou mai o Kakuhihewa: “I waa aha?” “I waa no Kawelo e holo ai i Kauai, e kaua me Aikanaka.” A lohe o Kakuhihewa, haawi mai la ia i mau waa no Kawelo e holo ai, no ka mea, e noho ana no o Kakuhihewa me ka makau ia Kawelo, o kipi ia ia, nolaila, haawi i waa no Kawelo e holo ai, i noho i Kauai.","Some little time after this, Kawelo sent Kanewahineikiaoha, Kamalama, Kalaumeki and Kauluiki, to go to Puuloa and ask of Kakuhihewa, who was king of Oahu at the time, for the use of a canoe. Upon the arrival of the messengers at Puuloa, Kakuhihewa asked of them: “What do you want?” Kanewahineikiaoha replied : “We have come for a double canoe for us.” Kakuhihewa again asked: “Canoe for what?” “A canoe for Kawelo to go to Kauai to fight Aikanaka.” When Kakuhihewa heard this, he ordered that a double canoe be given Kawelo; for Kakuhihewa even at this time was in fear of Kawelo, who at any time might rise up and overthrow his kingdom; he therefore furnished Kawelo with the means of removing him to Kauai where he would probably stay."
"A loaa na waa, he mau kaulua, hoi mai la lakou a pae ma Waikiki, hoomakaukau ka holo, a holo no ia la, ia wa, hoolaau mai o Kou kekahi wahine a Kawelo e holo pu i Kauai, hoole aku o Kawelo.

Kaikai ae la o Kawelo i na akua ona, a luna o ka heiau, paha aku la, penei:","Upon receiving the double canoe, the messengers returned and landed at Waikiki, where preparations for the voyage were immediately begun, completed, and a start was made on that day. As they were about to start, Kou, a second wife of Kawelo’s, urged that she too be allowed to accompany them to Kauai, but Kawelo would not allow it. They then set sail from Waikiki and made their first landing at Waianae, where they built a temple for the gods of Kawelo. After the temple was completed, Kawelo gathered his gods together, they being Kaneikapualena and Kulanihehu. Kawelo then lifted up his gods and placed them on the altar in the temple and prayed as follows:"
"E Kaneikapualena. E ku e hele kaua i Kauai, A ulu a noho, a noho a ulu.","Say, Kaneikapualena, Arise and let us journey to Kauai Where we shall grow and live, live and grow."
"Ma keia paha ana a Kawelo, kolili ana ka hulu moa i luna o ka lae o ke ’kua ona; paha hou aku la ia: [ ]","At the close of the prayer, the chicken feathers on the forehead of the god fluttered; so he chanted: [ ]"
"O kuu akua mana no hoi, Mai o’u kupuna mai, E Kulanihehu, e ku, E hele kaua i Kauai—a, Makau iho la keia akua, O ua akua mana ole nei o’u—a, Mai o’u kupuna mai—a.","Thou art my all powerful god From my ancestors. Say, Kulanihehu, arise! Let us journey to Kauai. This god is afraid, My god who is without power From my ancestors."
"Alaila, hopu iho la o Kawelo i ka laau ana ia Kuikaa, a paha aku la, penei:","Kawelo then took up his war club, Kuikaa, and chanted as follows:"
"A make aku la oe ia Kuikaa, Ia Hookaa, ia Kaakua, ia Kaaalo, E ike auanei oe i ka nao hoopai a Malailua. I ka laau e wali ai ko auwae, E oki ai o na ka hoola, E ike auanei oe apopo, I ka moa i hanai ia i ka la, A puupuu i ka lepo, A akaakaa ka hulu; Me he moa kau i ka uwahi, A eina ka hulu, Hookahi no pekuna au a ka moa i mahi la, Puko—a, puko—a.","There, you are made unconscious by Kuikaa, By Hookaa, by Kaakua, by Kaaalo.

Tomorrow you shall see The rooster that is fed of the sun, Till the crop fills with dirt And the feathers fall off Like a rooster that is hung up in the smoke With its feathers burnt off. The conquering cock has made but one kick. They are scattered, they are scattered."
"A pau keia paha ana a Kawelo, ia ahiahi, holo lakou mai Waianae aku a waena o ke kai o Kaieiewaho, mawaena o Waianae a me Kauai, hu mai la ke aloha o Kawelo ia Kou, ka wahine ana i waiho ai ma Waikiki; nolaila, paha mai la o Kawelo, penei:","At the close of this chant by Kawelo, that evening they set out from Waianae. As they reached a point in the channel of Kaieiewaho, between Kauai and Waianae, Kawelo’s love for Kou, the wife whom he left at Waikiki, began to well up within him, so he chanted as follows:"
"Aloha Kou e, Aloha Kou, Ke aloha mai nei Kou ia’u, Ka hoa hele i ka makani, I ka apaapaa anu o Ahulu nei, E ualo mai ana ia’u na niu o Pai, E enaena mai ana i kuu maka, Ke aa o Kuamanuunuu Ii au e kii, e kui, e lei—e, Na akulikuli papa o Huia nei la, E ualo mai ana ia’u—e.","Farewell to thee, Kou; farewell, Kou. The love of Kou is within me, My companion of the windy days And the cold of Ahulu. The coconut trees at Pai are calling me back; They appear as raging fire to my eyes, Like the volcanic rocks at Kuamanuunuu. I am tempted to get them, to string them and to wear them, The akulikuli blossoms there at Huia, For they are calling me back there."
"Ma keia paha a Kawelo, pane aku o Kamalama: “Ua ike no ka oe he aloha wahine kou, e noho ia aku nei no e oe, owau no la ke holo e kaua me Aikanaka.” Ma keia olelo a Kamalama, manao iho la o Kawelo, he olelo huhu kela a Kamalama, nolaila, paha aku la ia penei: “Ko’u ike la hoi auanei he mea hewa ia nou?”","At the close of this chant Kamalama answered: “You know that you love your wife; why didn’t you remain? I could have made the trip against Aikanaka by myself.” By these words of Kamalama, Kawelo thought that Kamalama must be angry with him, so he chanted these words: “How could I tell that it was going to hurt your feelings?”"
"Ma keia holo ana a lakou i Kauai, ike mua ia mai la o Keolewa i ka lele mai, iloko o ke ao, alaila, paha aku la o Kawelo: [ ]","On this trip to Kauai, Keolewa was seen above the clouds by Kawelo before the others, so he chanted: [ ]"
"Eia o Keolewa i ka ihu o ka waa e, Eia o Keolewa i ka ihu o ka waa e.","Keolewa is there directly ahead of the canoe, Keolewa is there directly ahead of the canoe."
"Ia wa, pane mai na makuakane mai Kauai mai, o ia o Kaweloikiakoo ma: “Wahahee oe e Kawelo. O ka makou moana no keia e holo ai me ou makua, mai ke ahiahi a ao a awakea, ike ia aku o Keolewa i ka lele mai me he manu la i luna.” Ma keia holo ana a lakou, wehe mai la kai ao o ke kakahiaka nui, ike aku la lakou ia Keolewa e lele mai ana i luna, a o ka puu hoi o Kalanipuu e au mai ana i ke kai.

Your parents and we two have traveled this ocean from evening till morn and noon, and Keolewa can only be seen as a bird in the sky.” Soon after this the dawn began to break, and Keolewa was then plainly seen by them all to windward, while the hill of Kalanipuu was also seen as though wading in the sea to meet them. When Kawelo’s uncles saw these different objects, they saw that Kawelo was right after all. At this time, they were directly off of Hanamaulu, so the two uncles said to Kawelo in a chant as follows:"
"E Kaweloleimakua, E pae—e, e pae—e, E kama hanau a ka lapa o Puna, Na maka o Haloa i luna, Kuu haku, kuu alii. E Kaweloleimakua, Kuu haku, kuu alii.","Say, Kaweloleimakua, Let us land, let us land. Say, offspring from the cliffs of Puna, The eyes of Haloa are looking from above, My lord, my chief."
"“I o—e, i o—e.” I mai ia Kawelo: “E pae kakou i anei, ike i na makua, na kaikuaana, kahu i o a hele i ke kaua.”","“Yes, what is it?” The uncles then said to Kawelo: “Let us land here, see your parents, your older brothers, cook some food and then proceed on to battle.”"
"E Kamalama iki kuu pokii, I Wailua ka ihu o na waa e I Wailua, e.","Say, little Kamalama, my younger brother, Point the bow of the canoe towards Wailua, Yes, towards Wailua."
"A lohe o Kamalama i keia olelo a Kawelo, hoihoi ae la ia i ka ihu o na waa i Wailua, holo aku la lakou a hiki i Wailua, lana pono iho la lakou makai o ke kulanakauhale. Alaila, paha aku la o Kawelo i kona kaikaina, ia Kamalama, penei:","When Kamalama heard the orders of Kawelo, he pointed the bow of the canoes toward Wailua. They then continued on to Wailua and anchored just below the village. Kawelo then chanted these lines regarding Kamalama:"
"E Kamalama iki kuu pokii, E kei ka noho, E hume ka malo, E ai ka ai me ka ia.","Say, little Kamalama, my younger brother, Sit up on your heels, Gird on your loin cloth And partake of food and meat."
"A lohe o Kamalama i keia olelo a Kawelo, kena ae la ia ia luna o na waa, e ai; ai iho la lakou a maona.

While they were lying off Wailua, the people on the top of the Nounou hill saw them, so the people roused up Aikanaka and told him of the coming of a large double canoe. When Aikanaka saw the canoe, he immediately sent Kaehuikiawakea, his best runner, with the orders: “You go on down and inspect that double canoe. If it is a war canoe, let them come ashore and they can meet Kuahulu and Onionikaua, my chief officers, and they can make war on them. But if the people on the canoe are on a journey to see the land, let them come ashore, where they can meet Kuahulu and Onionikaua, who have food and meat, wearing kapas, loin cloths and house to stop in.” [ ] Kaehuikiawakea then started off running until he arrived at the beach, then he plunged in and swam to the canoe. While he was swimming toward the canoe, he was seen by Kamalama, who chanted to Kawelo as follows:"
"E Kaweloleimakua, E pae—e, e pae—e, Kama hanau a ka lapa o Puna, Na maka o Haloa i luna, Kuu haku, kuu alii.","Say, Kaweloleimakua, Let us land, let us land. The offspring from the cliffs of Puna, The eyes of Haloa are looking from above, My lord, my chief."
"“I o—e, i o—e,” mai la o Kawelo. Pane mai o Kamalama: “I ke kanaka a ke ’kua o kaua, eia la, ke au mai nei.” I mai o Kawelo: “O kau kanaka no ia o ka manao ana aku, o ko kaua pokii, o Kaehuikiawakea.”","“What is it, what is it?” asked Kawelo. Kamalama replied: “Here is a man for an offering to our god. Here he is; he is about to come aboard.” Kawelo said: “Is our cousin, Kaehuikiawakea, then to be the person whom you think we ought to take and offer as a sacrifice to our god?”"
"A hiki o Kaehuikiawakea i na waa, pii aku la a hiki i luna, ninau aku la: “He mau waa aha keia?” I mai o Kamalama: “He mau waa kaua.” Olelo hou mai o Kaehuikiawakea: “A kaua, owai ka pukaua?” Olelo mai o Kamalama: “Owau no.” Ninau hou ua wahi kanaka nei: “Auhea o Kawelo?” “Aia no i Oahu.” Ninau hou kela: “A heaha hoi keia opeope nui i luna o ka pola o na waa?” “O ko makou mau wahi ukana no,” pela aku o Kamalama.","As soon as Kaehuikiawakea reached the canoe, he climbed aboard and asked: “What are these canoes for?” Kamalama replied: “They are war canoes.” Kaehuikiawakea again inquired: “When you make war, who is your champion?” Kamalama replied: “I am.” The man then asked again: “Where is Kawelo?” “He is in Oahu.” The man again asked: “What is this large bundle on the platform?” “It contains our different things,” answered Kamalama."
"Alaila, ku ae la o Kaehuikiawakea, a keekeehi iho la i luna o ka opeope, me ka olelo iho i ka opeope nui. Ninau aku la ia ia Kamalama: “Pehea kakou e kaua ai?” I mai o Kamalama: “E pae makou a uka, alaila, hapai oukou i na waa o makou a kau i uka, alaila, hele makou e auau, a hoi mai, alaila, ai a maona, puali na malo a paa, alaila, ia wa kakou e kaua ai.” Ae aku la o Kaehuikiawakea, me ka olelo aku ia Kamalama, “Aole e pau ke aho ia oukou, no ka mea, ua noho aku la no o Kawelo, ka mea i kaulana mai i ka ikaika.” Mahope o keia mau olelo ana, hoopuka aku oia i kana olelo hoonaukiuki ia Kamalama, penei: “E hoi hou oukou i Oahu, aole keia o na waa e kii mai ai e kaua ia Kauai nei.”","Kaehuikiawakea then stood up and felt of the bundle with his feet and remarked about the size of the bundle. After a while, he again asked Kamalama: “How is the fight to begin?” Kamalama replied: “Let us first be allowed to come ashore, then you can lift our canoe ashore. After that we will go and take a bath, then come back and partake of some food; after we are satisfied we will then gird on our loin cloths more tightly and the fight shall then begin.” Kaehuikiawakea consented to this and said to Kamalama: “We will not get out of breath for such as you, since Kawelo whose strength has been rumored to us has remained behind.” Soon after this, he again said to Kamalama boastingly: “You go back to Oahu; these are not the canoes with which to fight Kauai.”"
"Aia he waa nui, He waa iki, he waa loa, He waa poko, Alaila, kii mai e kaua ia Kauai nei.","You must have a large canoe, A small canoe, a long canoe And a short canoe Before you come and make war on Kauai."
"Ia laua e kamailio ana i luna o na waa paa mai la o uka i na kanaka, me na pukaua elua, oia o Kuahulu a me Onionikaua. O na koa malalo o laua, elua lau kanaka ka nui, aole i helu ia na wahine me na keiki.","While this conversation was being carried on between the two on the canoes, the people began to gather on the shore with the two champions, Kuahulu and Onionikaua. The number of men under these two were about eight hundred, not counting the women and children."
"A pae lakou i ke one, anehe mai na kanaka e kaua, i aku o Kaehuikiawakea: “Alia e kaua, e hapai kakou i na waa a kau i ke one maloo, hele lakou nei e auau a hoi mai, ai a maona, puali na malo a paa, alaila, kaua kakou.” Ae mai la na kanaka, [ ] a me na pukaua.

Let us carry the canoes to the dry sand and then let these people go and have a bath, and when they return, let them partake of some food; when they are satisfied they can then gird on their loin cloths, then after that we can fight them. ” The men [ ] and the two officers agreed to this. The people then waded in and lifted up the canoe onto their shoulders, both on the inside and outside of the canoe with Kawelo, Kamalama as well as all the rest of the people still seated in the canoe. At this time Kawelo quietly asked Kamalama: “Where are we?” Kamalama answered: “We are over the dry sand where some of the prickly grass grows.” Kawelo then said to Kamalama: “You go to my feet.” Kamalama then proceeded to the feet of Kawelo, pulled the end of the rope which held the bundle, and Kawelo was loosened. Kawelo then rose with his war club, Kuikaa. When the people who were following along either side of the canoe saw Kawelo, they called out in a loud voice: “O, you will all be killed! Here is Kawelo standing in the canoe.” When those who were carrying the canoe on their shoulders heard this call, they looked onto the canoe and when they saw Kawelo, they dropped the canoe down, crushing a good many of the people, while some of them were so afraid of Kawelo they were unable to run. Kawelo then looked towards Wailua and saw that the sands were in disorder and were hollowed out in places, leaving little gulches here and there, with the rocks exposed. And when he saw the people like the bending of the surf, he chanted:"
"He mea e nei la kaikoo nui o kai, Ke auau nei ka moana, He kai paha no Kahinalii, Ua ku ke a, ka halelo, Ke ahua pohaku i Wailua nei la, O ua one maikai nei, Ua malualua, ua kahawai, I ka pohaku o Kauai, O Kauai nui moku lehua, Aina make kau aloha ole, Pili makamaka ole ia Kawelo nei la.","How numerous are the high surfs today below! The ocean is bathing in foam. Is it the sea of Kahinalii? For the rocks are exposed and the sand is in hollows, And the rocks are in heaps in Wailua. The sands that once were level Are cut up and are in gulches; Cut up by the rocks of Kauai, Great Kauai, isle of lehua ; Land of death and lacking in love, Whose people are not the friends of Kawelo."
"Pueo—e, Pueo—e, Pueo opili i ka ua, Pueo kanikani i ka ua, Pa na’u na Kawelo, Na ke koa i ke awakea, He kaha pue wai no Wailua, Ke alo hiki i Kaupea, Kuhi au ka luhi kaua, O Onionikaua.

The owl that is wet by the rain, The owl that is hooting in the rain, You are hit by Kawelo, By the soldier of the noonday, The soldiers of the waters of Wailua, Of the path that leads to Kaupea Where you and I are made weary, Onionikaua. The men are all at the sand point, They are found within Kuikaa, The kapued head of Kuikaa. Grind your teeth in rage, Grind your teeth in rage. [ ]"
"O ka poe a pau i makau ole ia Kawelo, pau loa lakou i ka make i ka laau palau a Kawelo, ia Kuikaa.

As one side was killed by Kawelo, the canoe leaned over on that side; Kawelo then swung his club along the other side killing all the men there. In this slaughter, the two officers who were stationed at Wailua were also slain. Kawelo then sent Kamalama and his adopted sons, Kaeleha, Kalaumeki and Kauluiki and his companions, after the fleeing enemy."

Kaeleha and some of Kauluiki’s companions were placed on one side of the war canoe, Kalaumeki with the remainder of Kauluiki’s companions were placed on the other side while Kamalama himself took up the central position. In the battle that followed these preparations, none of Kawelo’s men were killed; but Kauluiki and his companions were so afraid of the warriors of Kauai that they gave up fighting and returned to their canoe. When Kawelo saw them coming, he asked them: “How is the battle?” Kauluiki and his companions answered: “We are beaten. When we left, your younger brother and adopted sons were on the point of being routed by the opposing forces. We have therefore returned to inform you of this and to get our canoe out to sea where we can wait for their return; but if they get killed, we will be ready to return to Oahu.” When Kawelo heard this from Kauluiki and his companions, he stretched out his feet against the mat and pulled the plaiting of the mat down, thus making a slit in the mat and looked through it. When he looked through, he saw the bravery of his brother Kamalama and adopted sons; they were on the point of routing the Kauai forces, and he admired the courage of his [handful of] men. After this he saw Kamalama and his men killing the men on the other side, while the few of the enemy left were running up Nounou hill. On the top of this hill, Aikanaka the king and Kauahoa the great warrior of Kauai had their camp. Kawelo was therefore very anxious lest Kamalama’s forces suffer at the hand of Kauahoa; so he called to him in a chant as follows:"
"Pau iki, pau nui, Pau loa, pau poko, Pau a’u lehua i ka manu, Ke aina mai la e ka manu. Na pua lehua i aina e ka manu a koe koena, Kalohe ua kamalii la, ko lelehu, Lehulehu mai la ke one, Hopu i ka papa hee i ka nalu, [ ] Kakala e Kamalama, O oe la ke koi, owau ka helu ai, Pau ka pili, ele ka ai i ka maha, O—e ohi ka pili, I lalo kuli o Kamalama, Pau ana ka ai i ke poho, Mo ka ihu i ka iliohae, Hae ka puaa i kona kahu, Hae ka mano i ke kala, Hae ka puhi i ka maunu, Eueu kolea i ka pupua, Pelua kuli, hana a noho, Ia Kuahilau ka luahi a kaua, Kaa i ke oho, helu papalua, He la koa, he la hee, He la malu nei e Kamalama, Ke lolelua nei ka ihe i ka lima, Ke kui nei ka ihe i ka pali lehua, Moa keiki, kuku ka heuheu Okala ka hulu o ke kea i halala, He pukoa wawahi waa o Kamalama no Wailua nei, Hoouka ia i na koa, Hee kuamoo me ka huna lewa, Auhee liilii, ioio moa i ka nahele I ka li a ke auhee nui, E ao ka loko e Kamalama, Aia mai ka maha laau O ka oa o Mamalahoa. O kauwila o Puukapele, O ka hapupue o Haalelea, O kee la o Kalalau, I wai auau no Kamalama, E Kamalama e kuu pokii, e hoi.","A few are consumed, many are consumed, All are consumed in a short space of time. Your lehua blossoms are consumed by the birds, They are being eaten by the birds, The lehua blossoms that are partly eaten by the birds, The children are sporting with your men. The people are gathering on the sand, They take up their boards to ride the surf. [ ] Kamalama is like a full-grown cock. Thou art the piercing rod; I will keep the record. After they are slain, the record will surely be great. Yes, gather up the spoils. Kamalama’s knees are bent down, The food will soon be prepared, The nose is bitten by the barking dog, The pig will attack its master. The shark will attack the kala fish, The eel will attack the bait, The plover will shake its tail, Bend the knees, make him sit, Kuahilau our opponent. Straighten out the hair, and thus double your points. There is a day when one is brave and a day when one is routed. This is a cool day, Kamalama, For the spear is darting backwards and forwards from the hand. The spear is stringing the cliffs of lehua. The down of a young chicken stands up, The feathers of the cock are ruffled. Kamalama is like a hidden reef which breaks the canoes of Wailua Loaded down with warriors. The highways are filled with the fleeing soldiers Scattered and peeping like young chicks in the brush. Forbear of the great slaughter, Beware of thine inwards, Kamalama. Eat up the points of the spears Made from the rafters of Mamalahoa, The kauwila wood of Puukapele, The hapupue of Haalelea, The kee of Kalalau. They are as playthings for Kamalama. Kamalama, my younger brother, come back."
"Ma keia paha a Kawelo, hoi mai la o Kamalama a me Kaeleha ma laua o Kalaumeki, a hiki lakou i kahi o Kawelo ma, ninau mai la o Kawelo: “Pehea ke kaua?” I aku o Kamalama: “Ua pau o Kuahulu ma i ka make, a o na kanaka i koe, oia no kela e pii la i ka puu o Nounou, a o ka hoahanau no o kaua ke koa nui o luna i koe, o Kauahoa.” A lohe o Kawelo i keia olelo a kona kaikaina, maopopo iho la ia ia he hoopunipuni o Kauluiki ma, manao iho la ia he poe koa hohe wale, nolaila, paha aku la o Kawelo, penei:","In this chant of Kawelo’s, his three soldiers, Kamalama, Kaeleha and Kalaumeki, heard it, and they returned. Upon their arrival at the place where Kawelo and the others were standing, Kawelo asked them: “How fares the war?” Kamalama replied: “Kuahulu and his companion and a good many of their men are dead; what few are left are those that are climbing the hill, Nounou; and Kauahoa, our relative, is the greatest warrior that is left on the hill.” When Kawelo heard his brother’s report, he realized at once that the report given him by Kauluiki and the others was all a lie, and he was therefore satisfied that they were cowards. Therefore he chanted the following lines:"
"Aole hoi no oukou kahi aloha, No ka pohaku i kaa aku nei; [ ] Komo hewa ko’u waa, Pau hewa ka’u ia me ka’u ai, Pau hewa ko’u kapa me ko’u malo. Kai no he koa no ka la nui, Aole he koa no ka la iki; Wahawaha i ka laau nui, He iki hoi ke kihapai, O ka noho ana ka ia Kauai, Noho i kalukalu o Puna, Lilo Puna ia Kaeleha, Lilo Kona ia Kamalama, Lilo Koolau ia Kalaumeki, Pau ka aina i na koa, Mihi i ka hune e Kauluiki ma. Aloha i ka hoi wale e na pokii e, Nele e na pokii i ka aina ole la.","You certainly do not deserve even a small portion of pity Because of the rock that has just rolled. [ ] The loading down of my canoe was a waste, The consuming of my food and meat were without any benefit. My kapas and loin cloths were worn without any returns. I had thought that you were soldiers worthy of a great day, But I see that you are only soldiers for small affairs. You detested the great stick, Your cultivated fields will therefore be small In your occupation of Kauai, In the kalukalu of Puna. Puna shall be possessed by Kaeleha, Kona shall be possessed by Kamalama, Koolau shall be possessed by Kalaumeki; All the lands are possessed by the brave ones. Kauluiki and the others shall repent of their want. How I pity your return with nothing, younger brothers, For my younger brothers are indeed without possessions."
"A lohe o Kauluiki ma, pane aku la lakou: “Ka! E aho no ka hoi ka noho ana me Kakuhihewa, he ai i kalo moa, he ole loa ka hoi ka holo ana mai nei me Kawelo. Ua pau ka aina i na koa, o ke aha la ka kakou?” Nolaila, manao iho la lakou e hoi i Oahu nei.","When Kauluiki and the others heard this, they said: “How much better our conditions would have been had we stayed with Kakuhihewa; we would surely have eaten of the cooked taro, while in following Kawelo we get nothing, for the lands will be given to the brave soldiers only, and what will we get?” They then thought of returning to Oahu."
"Ike iho la o Kaehuikiawakea, ua make na pukaua o lalo o Wailua, pii aku la ia i luna o ka puu o Nounou, e hai aku ia Aikanaka i ka make o na pukaua a me na kanaka o lalo. Ma keia pii ana o Kaehuikiawakea i luna o ka puu o Nounou, ike aku la o Kawelo, a paha aku la ia ia Kamalama:","When Kaehuikiawakea saw that their chief warriors in Wailua were slain, he climbed up the Nounou hill and informed Aikanaka of the facts and how most of their men and the two captains were slain. As Kaehuikiawakea was climbing the hill, Kawelo saw him and so called out to Kamalama in a chant as follows:"
"O mai la o Kamalama: “O.” I aku o Kawelo: “E alualu aku oe i kahi pokii o kaua, a wehe mai oe i kahi malo, a wawau aku oe ma ka aoao, a hookuu aku.” A lohe o Kamalama, alualu aku la ia, a loaa o Kaehuikiawakea, alaila, kahea aku la: “A make!

A hiki o Kaehuikiawakea i luna o ka puu o Nounou, lalau aku la o Kamalama, kaili ae la i ka malo, a wawau mai la i ka aoao, a hookuu aku la. A hiki o Kaehuikiawakea i mua o Aikanaka, huli iho la i lalo kona alo. Ninau mai la o Aikanaka, penei: “A hua a pane! A pane ka waha, he hoolono ko onei.” [ ]","Kamalama replied: “Yes.” Kawelo then said to him: “Chase after our relative, unloose his loin cloth, scratch his side and let him go.” When Kamalama heard this, he chased and caught up with Kaehuikiawakea, and then called out: “You are dead! You are dead!! I am going to kill you, Kaehuikiawakea!!!” When Kaehuikiawakea heard this, he was so afraid that he was almost unable to run any more. On his reaching the top of the hill, Kamalama reached out and took his loin cloth, scratched his side and allowed him to go."
"I mai o Kaehuikiawakea: “Ua pau loa kakou, aohe kanaka i koe, ua pau loa i ka make.” Ninau aku o Aikanaka: “Owai na waa?” “O Kamalama ka hai mua ana mai i kai, i ka pae ana mai i uka, o Kawelo ka keia ope nui e waiho nei.”","When Kaehuikiawakea arrived in the presence of Aikanaka, he fell face down. [ ] Aikanaka then asked him: “Speak the word. Open your mouth and speak the word, I am listening.” Kaehuikiawakea then said: “We have all been slain. There are no men left; all are dead.” Aikanaka then asked: “Whose double canoe is it?” “When it was in the sea, we were told that it belonged to Kamalama; but when it landed, the large bundle which we saw on the canoe turned out to be Kawelo.”"
"He mau koa keia no Aikanaka, i luna o ka puu o Nounou kahi i noho ai. Ia Kaehuikiawakea e olelo ana ia Aikanaka, ku ae la o Kaihupepenuiamouo a me Muno, a iho aku la me ko laua mau lau kanaka elua.

Ina e hou mai o Kamalama i ka ihe ana, he umi kanaka e ku i ka pahu hookahi ana, alaila maalili ka ihe.”","These two men were warriors belonging to Aikanaka, and they were on the Nounou hill with him. While Kaehuikiawakea was speaking to Aikanaka, Kaihupepenuiamouo and Muno stood up and proceeded down the hill with their eight hundred men. Upon their arrival at the bottom of the hill, they were met by Kamalama and his men, and, in a very short time, they were all killed with the exception of Kaehuikiawakea, who returned to the top of the hill and again informed Aikanaka of the results, saying, “All the men are slain and I alone am left. That cannot be called a battle; it is like real fire. Whenever Kamalama throws his spear, it will go through about ten men before it stops.”"
"Ia Kaehuikiawakea e olelo ana ia Aikanaka, ku mai la keia mau koa elua a liki i ke kaua me Kamalama. Iho aku la laua me ko laua mau kanaka, hookahi lau.

At the bottom of the hill, they were met by Kamalama, Kaeleha and Kalaumeki when the fighting began. These two men, Walaheeikio and Moomooikio, were very powerful men and were very skilful in the use of the spear. They could hit a grass blade, an ant, a fly and even a flea. In this battle their men in a short time were all slain, and the two were left alone. They however continued on the fight with Kamalama. In this fight, Kaeleha’s hand was struck by a blow from a club and he withdrew, leaving Kamalama and Kalaumeki to continue the conflict. Soon after Kaeleha withdrew Kamalama also withdrew, and in fact, he narrowly escaped being slain by the two men. When Kawelo saw that Kamalama was almost spent and how Kalaumeki bravely continued with the fight, he chanted as follows:"
"Ia hookaa o Kalaumeki i hope, Pohu ke kai, malino ke au, Hoolana ka waa i ke po’i, Nalo koli’a ka puu o Kamae, I ke ehu o na wawae, Ku aku la i ke kai, O ua koa nui nei, o Kamalama.","When Kalaumeki is passed, The sea becomes calm, the waves become still, The canoes are floating in the line of surf. The hill of Kamae is become hid By the dust from the feet. He is beaten by the sea, The great soldier, Kamalama."
"A lohe o Kamalama i keia paha a Kawelo, huhu iho la o Kamalama, a hoi aku la. Ike mai la o Kanewahineikiaoha i ka hoi ana o Kamalama, olelo aku la ia ia Kawelo: “E, ua huhu paha ko kaikaina ia oe, ei’ aku la ke hoi mai la.” A ike o Kawelo, paha aku la ia penei: [ ]","When Kamalama heard this chant by Kawelo, he became very angry and he returned. When Kanewahineikiaoha saw Kamalama returning, she said to Kawelo: “Say, I think your younger brother is angry with you, for there he is coming back.” When Kawelo saw this, he chanted as follows: [ ]"
"Ea mai ana ke ao ua o Koolau, Ea mai ana ma Nihoa, Ma ka mole mai o Lehua, Ua iho la pulu ke kahawai, Pulu a’u lehua i ka makoa, Kahe ka wai ke hanini nei i kai, He mea e nei wai nui o uka.

Nolaila paha ka ikaika ole.","The rain cloud of Koolau is making its appearance. It appears from Nihoa, From the lower end of Lehua. It has rained and the valleys are wet. Wet are my lehuas with the makoa rain. The water is running, it is flooding the lowlands, The waters from the uplands are raging, For the sound from the drift logs is heard. It is caused by my favorite younger brother, The great soldier, Kamalama. Say, my younger brother Kamalama, Come back and partake of some food; Perchance it has something to do with thy weakness."
"A lohe o Kamalama i keia paha a Kawelo, huli aku la ia e kaua hou, a loaa aku la o Kalaumeki, kaua iho la lakou, a hee o Kamalama ma, a no keia hee ana, ua hiki ke kaua i ke alo o Kawelo.

After a short while, Kamalama and companion were routed, and in this way the fighting was carried to the very presence of Kawelo. Upon the arrival of Walaheeikio in the presence of Kawelo, Kawelo chanted as follows:"
"Aia hoi ha kau wahine o kuu kaikuahine, O ka hanai a Malaiakalani, O kau wahine ia, e—a?","Why not take my sister as your wife, The ward of Malaiakalani, Take her as your wife?"
"Hoole mai la o Walaheeikio ia Kawelo: “Aole paha nau e haawi mai ka wahine a ke koa; o oe no ka makou a make ae, hai no o Aikanaka ia oe i luna o ka lele, puni no o Kauai nei ia makou, ai no i kalo moa.” Alaila, paha hou aku la o Kawelo, penei:","Walaheeikio then refused to accept the offer made by Kawelo, saying: “It is not for you to present the warrior with a wife. We are going after you until we kill you; when you shall be offered by Aikanaka upon the altar for a sacrifice. Then the whole of Kauai shall be ours, and we will eat the cooked taro.” Kawelo then chanted as follows:"
"E o la hoi e uhai ka maka o ko ihe, Alaila, pahu mai ia Kawelo.",Why not break the point of your spear then And throw it at Kawelo?
"I aku o Walaheeikio: “Aole paha e uhai ka maka o ka’u ihe ia oe, no ka mea, o oe no e ku mai nei, o ka hakala hale, ua like, aole e hala keia ihe ia oe ke pahu aku.” Alaila , paha hou o Kawelo, penei:","Walaheeikio replied: “The point of my spear shall not be broken by you; because you stand there as big as the end of a house, this spear will not miss when I throw it at you.” Kawelo then chanted back the following:"
"E o la hoi e hou mai ua ihe au, A kai ae i ka pola o ka malo, A ku aku i ka lepo nui, Hoi aku a lohe o Aikanaka, Kahi i noho ai ia Kauai nei, He mai nui nou ka hilahila.","Why don’t you throw your spear at me then? When I shall let it pass at the end of my loin cloth, Where it will glance to the great earth. Then when it is reported to Aikanaka, Under whom you are living in Kauai, Shame, like sickness, will overcome you."
"A lohe ua wahi kanaka nei, hou mai la ia i kana ihe, a ike o Kawelo, hoaka ae la ia i ka ihe i ka pola o ka malo, a ku aku la ka ihe i ka lepo, aole ia Kawelo, [ ] hilahila iho la, a holo aku la. Ma keia holo ana o Walaheeikio, mai ke alo aku o Kawelo, hahau aku la o Kawelo i kana laau ia Kuikaa, a make iho la o Walaheeikio.","When the man heard this, he threw his spear at Kawelo. When Kawelo saw the spear coming, he struck it with his hand making it touch the end of his loin cloth, then it glanced to the earth, missing Kawelo. This so shamed the man that he immediately [ ] turned and started to run away. At this attempt on the part of Walaheeikio to escape, Kawelo struck him with his war club, Kuikaa, killing him instantly."
"Make kela koa, koe o Moomooikio, alaila, paha aku o Kawelo, penei:","Upon the death of this warrior, Moomooikio came up and took his place. When Kawelo saw him, he chanted as follows:"
"E Moomooikio—e, Eia kau wahine o kuu wahine, O Kanewahineikiaoha, O kau wahine ia, e—a?","Say, Moomooikio, Here, take my wife and let her be your wife, Kanewahineikiaoha. Will you accept her as your wife?"
"[Maanei ua like na olelo ana me ko kela koa, me ko Walaheeikio, nolaila, e waiho i ke kakau ana maanei.]","[Here the narrative is the same as that of the other warrior, that of Walaheeikio, therefore that part is omitted.]"
"A make iho la o Walaheeikio a me Moomooikio ia Kawelo holo aku la o Kaehuikiawakea a hiki i luna o ka puu o Nounou, olelo aku la ia Aikanaka, i ka make o keia mau koa elua.

When Aikanaka heard this, he said: “At last, the cold feeling has entered me, for the house that has sheltered me is broken.”"
"Ia Kaehuikiawakea e olelo ana ia Aikanaka, ku mai la keia koa o Kahakaloa a paha, e olelo ana, aole e pakele o Kawelo ia ia. Wahi a Kahakaloa: “I nahea ka Kawelo ao ana i ke koa, a kakou i noho iho nei a holo aku nei i Oahu, a moe aku la i ke kaikamahine a Kalonaikahailaau; ina o kana hauna laau a na ka makuahunowai ona, aole ia e pakele ia’u.

While he was here living with us before he sailed for Oahu, where he married the daughter of Kalonaikahailaau, he knew nothing about fighting. If the strokes of the war club learned by him are those of his father-in-law, then he will never escape me, because I have fought against his father-in-law and our clubs only tapped one another; he was not killed and I was not killed.” When he finished boasting, he proceeded on down the hill with two hundred men, and when they reached the bottom, the fighting began. Kamalama then slew all the men with the exception of Kahakaloa whom he did not tackle. When Kawelo saw Kahakaloa, he chanted as follows:"
"O ka-haka-nui, o ka-haka-iki, o ka-haka-loa, O ka-haka-kau aipu, Keia la paha e—a ?","The great haka ; the small haka; the long haka; The haka for the putting up of calabashes; Perhaps on this day, it shall be done."

Kahaka, chief of Kauai, is my name.” Soon after this, they both stood up, Kawelo with his war club, Kuikaa, and Kahakaloa with his war club. They both raised their war clubs together. Kahakaloa swung his war club sideways, hitting Kawelo in the middle, staggering him. Kawelo then raised his club with a [ ] swirl from the ground, cutting the small toe, the small finger and the tip of the ear off the same side. Kawelo then fell to the ground and laid there. As Kawelo was lying on the ground, Kaehuikiawakea said to Kahakaloa: “Strike him another blow, so as to kill him, for I see his eyes staring at us.” When Kahakaloa heard this, he answered by chanting the following lines:"
"Ua make he laau na ka ui. Hookahi no laau a ka ui make, O iho auanei a hiki i lalo i o Milu, I aku i hahau alua ia e Kahakaloa. Make ai ke koa nui o Kawelo.","He is dead, for it is the blow from the young; The young makes but one blow to kill, Else he will go down to Milu And say that he was struck twice by Kahakaloa. Thus was Kawelo the great soldier killed."

Upon their arrival on the top of Nounou hill, Kahakaloa said: “I have downed Kawelo. I have returned to have something to eat, and when I have satisfied my hunger, I will then return and kill my opponent.” When Aikanaka heard this, he ordered his two chief stewards, Kapinaonuianio and Nioiwawalu, to cook a chicken for Kahakaloa. When Aikanaka saw that the small toe of one of Kahakaloa’s feet was cut off, he asked: “Why is your small toe cut?” Kahakaloa replied: “Such a thing is bound to be cut off sooner or later, for it sticks out so.” Aikanaka again asked: “And your small finger, what has become of it?” “Such a thing too is bound to be cut off, for it projects out so.” “And your ear?” “That also is bound to be cut off, for it curves out so at the top.”"
"A moa ka moa, ai iho la o Kahakaloa a maona, pau ae la ka ai o ka umeke, papale iho la o Kahakaloa i ka umeke i ke poo, a iho aku la.

After finishing the food in the calabash, he took the empty calabash and placed it over his head and started on down the hill. When he reached the bottom, Kamalama saw him and so he informed Kawelo of the fact saying: “Here comes a bald-headed man down the hill; his forehead is awfully shiny.” Kawelo then said to Kamalama: “That is not a bald-headed man, it is Kahakaloa. He went on back to have something to eat, and, after finishing the food that was in the calabash, he has taken the calabash and put it on his head. That is the reason it is so shiny.”"
"A hiki o Kahakaloa i mua o Kawelo, nana aku la ia ia Kawelo e noho mai ana i luna, olelo mai la o Kaehuikiawakea, ia Kahakaloa: “Ola hou o Kawelo, nolaila, o oe ke make o ke koa, aole au e make ke kukini.” Ku o Kawelo i luna, ku o Kahakaloa i luna, alaila, kiko’u mai la o Kawelo i ka laau, a pa ma ka lae o Kahakaloa, nalowale iho la na maka o Kahakaloa i ka umeke ana e papale ana i ke poo, alaila, hahau hou o Kawelo i kana laau palau, ia Kuikaa, a make loa iho la o Kahakaloa.

Kaehuikiawakea then said to Kahakaloa: “Kawelo has come to life again, therefore you the soldier will be killed. I cannot be killed, for I am a runner.” When Kawelo saw Kahakaloa approaching, he stood up and prepared for the conflict. Kahakaloa was also preparing himself and stood on the defensive. Kawelo then raised his club and tapped the forehead of Kahakaloa, and forcing the calabash down over his eyes; before Kahakaloa could uncover his eyes, Kawelo again raised his club Kuikaa and struck Kahakaloa, killing him. [ ] After the death of Kahakaloa, Kaehuikiawakea returned to the top of the hill to report to Aikanaka the death of Kahakaloa. Upon his arrival in the presence of Aikanaka, Aikanaka asked him: “Where is Kahakaloa?” “He is dead.” Aikanaka then said: “How could it be possible for a man that was maimed as he was to live? I suppose he was allowed to come back so that I could see for myself that it was the king’s pig, for his ear was cut off.”"
"O Kauahoa, oia ke koa kaulana o Aikanaka i ka nui a me ke kiekie, a oia hoi ke koa a Kawelo, i li ai ka io i ke anuanu a me ka huihui o ka makau, a ua apo ia mai o Kawelo e na kukuna weliweli o ko Kauahoa kulana ui, a me ke koa. A nolaila, ua kau ka weli.","Kauahoa was the most noted of Aikanaka’s warriors in size and stature, and it was this warrior that caused the cold perspiration to ooze out of the body of Kawelo and for a moment fear entered his breast, for Kauahoa was indeed good to look upon and was a grand warrior to behold."
"Ia Aikanaka e kamailio ana no Kahakaloa i ka make ia Kawelo, lohe aku la o Kauahoa. Iho aku la ia me kana laau palau o Kahehumakua ka inoa, he koa makua ole no Kahihikolo. (Ua olelo ia i loko o keia moolelo he laau nui loa o Kahehumakua, o ke kumu no o ka lau, o na lala, i na e lawe o Kauahoa, kau no ka manu i luna a kani no.) A ike o Kawelo ia Kauahoa e iho mai ana mai ka puu mai o Nounou, nui launa ole, malu ka la ia Kauahoa, no ke kiekie a me ka nui launa ole. A hiki o Kauahoa i mua o Kawelo, ala mai la o Kawelo a hopu aku la i kana laau o Kuikaa, a me ka wahine, o Kanewahineikiaoha, ma ka akau, a o ke kaikaina ma ka hema, o na keiki mahope. Ma keia ku ana a Kawelo me kana laau o Kuikaa, nona ka loa he umi anana, ua like kona loihi mai ka manea wawae ae o Kauahoa a ka piko i waena, koe ae o luna, me he mea la, he iwakalua anana ke kiekie o Kauahoa. Ma keia ku ana, ua hoopuni ia o Kawelo e ka weliweli o ka makau ia Kauahoa. No ka mea, elua wale no ano laau i loaa ia Kawelo, malalo ae, a maluna iho, aole i loaa ia Kawelo ka laau hikau pea. Nolaila, noonoo iho la o Kawelo i ke kaua e make ai o Kauahoa ia ia, aole nae he loaa, a hopo iho la ia. Ma keia ku ana a Kawelo, ua loihi loa ke ku ana e noonoo, a loaa iho la kona noonoo, e kaua no a make mamuli o ke kaua.","When Aikanaka was telling of the death of Kahakaloa by Kawelo, Kauahoa heard it, and he took up his war club, called Kahehumakua, a first growth koa tree from Kahihikolo, and proceeded on down the hill. (It is said that this war club, Kahehumakua, was a very large one, for it was nothing else but a tree with its branches and leaves still on; and when carried by Kauahoa, the birds would perch and sing in it.) When Kawelo saw Kauahoa coming down the hill and saw how large he was, casting a large shadow because of his great height, he began to have some fear of his chances. When Kauahoa arrived in the presence of Kawelo, Kawelo picked up his club and took his stand by the side of Kanewahineikiaoha, his wife, to the right of Kauahoa; his brother stood to the left of Kauahoa, and his adopted sons stood behind. As Kawelo stood up with his war club, which was ten fathoms in length, the club with one end on the ground only could reach to the middle of Kauahoa, showing that Kauahoa was about twenty fathoms in height. In standing thus, Kawelo was almost overcome with fear of Kauahoa, for Kawelo was only educated in two ways of fighting with the war club; the stroke from the ground upwards and the one from above downwards. He was not taught in the side strokes. Therefore, Kawelo began to study how to overcome his opponent, but for a time he was undecided what to do, which made him very uncertain of the outcome. This studying took him some time and gradually his fears began to vanish, as he decided to fight until death ended the battle."
"Hu ae la ke aloha o Kawelo ia Kauahoa, i ko laua wa e noho liilii ana me ko laua kaikuaana haku me Aikanaka. Nolaila, paha aku la ia me ka hoalohaloha aku no nae i ua hoahanau nei, aia hoi i kona manao ke kaua a me ka ole; penei ka paha ana: [ ]","After the fear had disappeared, he began to take pity on his opponent; he remembered of their childhood days and of their lord and king Aikanaka, so he chanted a mele of love, hoping in this way to put the matter of their fighting or not up to Kauahoa. Following is the chant: [ ]"
"Pehu kaha ka limu o Hanalei, Pehu ka limu i ka maka o ka opua, Hai hewa ka lima i ke kaua kamalii, E’i aku ke kaua i ka hope, Me he ku la na ke kai hohonu, Me ka hiwahiwa a Kauakahi, He opuu oe, he kakala kela, Na ka ole ka hue a ke kai e, Ea Kauahoa ka ui o Hanalei, Ala o Kamalama ka ui o Kualoa, Ala o Kawelo ka ui o Waikiki, Ala o Kaelehapuna ka ui o Ewa, Ala o Kalaumeki ka ui o Waianae, Huhue aku kaua moe i ke awakea, Kapae ke kaua e ka hoahanau E waiho ia’u i kou hoahanau Aole hoi na la o kuu hoike, Kuu hoa hele o ka wa kamalii, Hoa kui lehua o Waikaee, A kaua e kui kane ai, I lei no ke kaikuaana haku o kaua, E Kanewahineikiaoha, Ko pikoi hoolei ia i luna. I helua, i hele lua, I kaupoku o Hanalei. E ala e Hanalei.","Swollen and enlarged is the moss of Hanalei, Swollen is the moss in the eyes of the pointed clouds. The hand is uselessly broken in a mock fight between children, For the main fight is yet to come, Like the letting down of nets in a deep sea, When the pride of Hanalei is met. Thou art but a mere bud, he is a full grown cock, For the sea is ceaseless in its beating. Kauahoa, the pride of Hanalei, is here; Kamalama, the pride of Kualoa, is risen; Kawelo, the pride of Waikiki, is risen; Kaelehapuna, the pride of Ewa, is risen; Kalaumeki, the pride of Waianae, is risen. Let us then cease fighting and rest in the noon of the day. Put away the fighting, my brother, And leave me, your own kindred, For these are not the days for me to make myself known. My companion in childhood’s wanderings, My companion in stringing the lehua blossoms of Waikaee, Where you and I as boys did string them, A wreath for our older brother and lord. Say, Kanewahineikiaoha, Throw up your pikoi To the top, to the very top, To the ridgepole of Hanalei. Arise thou, Hanalei."
"A lohe o Kanewahineikiaoha i keia paha o Kawelo, o kona manawa ia i hoolei ai i ka pikoi i luna, a lohe ae la o Kawelo i ka nakeke ana o luna, nana ae la ia e lele ana ka pikoi, alaila, paha hou ae la o Kawelo, penei:","As soon as Kanewahineikiaoha heard the order of Kawelo in his chant, to throw up the pikoi, she immediately threw it up, and Kawelo heard the noise of the ball as it entangled in the top of the club. Kawelo then looked up, and, when he saw that the pikoi was tangled, he continued chanting:"
"Hanalei aina anuanu, aina koekoe, Aina a ka pea i noho ai, Ea Kauahoa ka ui o Hanalei.","Hanalei, the cold land, the wet land, The land where the end is. For Kauahoa, the stalwart youth of Hanalei, is here."
"Olelo mai la o Kauahoa: “Aole e kapae nei laau ia oe, i ka la o ke kaua; ua noke ia mai nei ka hoi makou e oe a pau loa i ka make, a pehea e kapae ai keia laau ia oe? Nau no hoi paha, he mai no hoi kau e nana iho; a na’u aku no hoi, he mai no hoi ka’u e nana iho.”","Kauahoa replied: “This club will never spare you in the day of battle. You have slain our men so that there are none left; how can you then expect this club to spare you? As it has been your deal, you can see the result; and when it will be my deal, I will see the result.”"
"Ma keia olelo a Kauahoa, ua hoopuni ia o Kawelo i ka makau a me ka weliweli no Kauahoa, aka, hoomanao no nae o Kawelo i ko laua wa kamalii, i ko laua wa e hoolele lupe ana me Kauahoa. Moku ae la ka Kauahoa lupe ia Kawelo, aole nae he [ ] huhu aku o Kauahoa ia Kawelo; nolaila, manao no ia e make ana no ia ia. Nolaila, paha hou aku la o Kawelo ia Kauahoa, penei:","In this reply by Kauahoa, Kawelo was filled with a great fear, but when his mind went back to their childhood days and remembered how his kite got tangled up with Kauahoa’s kite and how Kauahoa’s kite broke away, and how Kauahoa was [ ] afraid to fight him, he made up his mind that he would again be the master this day; so he again chanted to Kauahoa as follows:"
"O Hanalei aina ua, Aina anuanu, aina koekoe, Aina a ka pea i noho ai, Noho ana e liu ana e, Maewa ana ka ukiukiu o Honokoa, I ka pali o Kalehuawehe; Pua ka lama me ka wiliwili, O ka ua lele ma waho o Mamalahoa, O Kauahoa o ka meeui o Hanalei, O ke kanaka a Kamalama i hopo ai o Kauahoa, He mea e ka nui—e—a! Eia ka hoi ua kanaka nui O Kauai, o Kauahoa.","Hanalei, the land of rain, The cold land, the wet land, The land where the end is. Sitting there, delaying there, For the anger of Honokoa is reviling. At the cliff of Kalehuawehe Where the lama and wiliwili bloom, Where the rain sweeps on the outside of Mamalahoa. Kauahoa, the stalwart youth of Hanalei, The person of whom Kamalama is afraid, Kauahoa, For he is indeed large. He is the largest man Of Kauai, Kauahoa."
"Maanei e maopopo ai ia kakou ka nui o Kauahoa, kona kiekie a me kona laula. Ewalu kahaku. Ewalu ka mana kahawai, ewalu ka poe kaua. Eia ke ano o keia mau helu.

Ia Kawelo e paha ana imua o Kauahoa, nana ae la ia i kana wahine o Kanewahineikiaoha , a paha ae la, penei:","We will here give a description of Kauahoa, his height and width. His height was eight times five yards, or forty yards, or one hundred and twenty feet. He was also compared to the size of eight streams, and his strength was equal to that number of streams or to eight companies of forty men each, or to three hundred and twenty men. After Kawelo had chanted to Kauahoa, he looked toward his wife Kanewahineikiaoha and chanted as follows:"
"E Kanewahineikiaoha e; Ko pikoi hoolei ia i luna, I helelua, i helelua, I kaupoku o Hanalei la. E ala e Hanalei e, A make o Kauahoa ia oe, Ai ae ia Hanalei, Aahu ae i ka pawehe o Niihau, Ai la oe i ka manu o Kaula.","Say, Kanewahineikiaoha, Your pikoi, throw it up, At Helelua, at Helelua At the ridge-pole of Hanalei. Arise thou, Hanalei, Until Kauahoa thou hast killed, When Hanalei thou shalt possess, And the mats of Niihau thou shalt wear, And the birds of Kaula thou shalt eat."
"A pau ka paha ana a Kawelo, olelo aku la ia i ke kaikaina ia Kamalama, me na keiki hookama o Kaeleha laua o Kalaumeki: “E, ina oukou i ike i kahi e poha ai [ ] ka la, ma laila no oukou e ku ai, i hahau iho no o Kauahoa i ka laau ana, aole oukou e loaa, puka no oukou ma laila, a pakele no.” Mahope o keia olelo a Kawelo ia lakou, ia wa i hoomoe ai o Kauahoa i ka laau ana, lele aku la o Kawelo ma waho o ka hua o ka laau a Kauahoa, a ku iho la, mahope mai o Kauahoa. Ia wa, kulou iho la o Kauahoa i lalo, a hoala mai la i ka laau ana. Ia Kauahoa i hoala ai i ka laau ana, ia wa o Kawelo i hahau ai i kana laau palau Kuikaa ia Kauahoa, a nahae iho la o Kauahoa mai luna a lalo, a kokoke e lele loa, makau e iho la ka laau a Kawelo, i ka maea o ka honowa o Kauahoa. A make iho la o Kauahoa, o ka pau no ia o na koa o Aikanaka i ka make.","At the close of this chant, Kawelo said to his younger brother, Kamalama, and to his adopted sons Kaeleha and Kalaumeki: “Where you see the sun shine, there you must stand, so that when Kauahoa strikes his club, you will not be under it, and [ ] in that way escape death.” As soon as this instruction was given, as Kauahoa was raising his club, Kawelo jumped back out of its reach and stood behind Kauahoa, so that the club dropped in front of Kauahoa. Kauahoa then reached down to pick up the club, and, while in a stooping position, Kawelo raised his club and struck Kauahoa a blow, cutting him in two and killing him. As the body was almost severed, Kawelo’s club, Kuikaa, was reluctant [to finish] on account of the bad odor of Kauahoa’s body. Thus was Kauahoa killed, the last of Aikanaka’s great warriors."
"A po ua la nei, olelo aku o Kawelo ia Kamalama ma: “Ke pii nei maua i luna o ka puu o Nounou; ina oukou i nana ae a a ke ahi i keia po i luna o ka puu, ua puni o Kauai nei ia kakou.” Pii aku la o Kawelo me kana wahine i luna o ka puu o Nounou. A hiki laua i ka hulili, alaila, paha aku la o Kawelo, penei:","At sundown that day, Kawelo said to Kamalama and to the rest of his men: “My wife and I are going to climb the Nounou hill. When you see a fire burning on the hill this night, Kauai is ours.” Kawelo and his wife then climbed the hill until they came to the ladder, where Kawelo chanted as follows:"
"E Aikanaka, alii o luna nei, E noho ana i ka puu o Nounou; E hele mai oe e ike kaua, A ai no kaua ia Kauai, A e moe i ka moena.","Say, Aikanaka, chief of this height, Who lives on the hill of Nounou, Come and let us make friends, When we will together take possession of Kauai, And sleep on the mats."
"A lohe o Aikanaka i keia paha a Kawelo, olelo aku la ia: “O Kawelo keia.” Hoole kekahi poe: “Aole ia e hiki mai, ua luhi i ke kaua i ke ao, nolaila, ua hiamoe aku la kona po.” I aku o Aikanaka: “O Kawelo no keia leo e paha mai nei.” Ia lakou e hoopaapaa ana, paha hou mai la o Kawelo, penei:","When Aikanaka heard the chant, he said: “That is Kawelo.” The rest of the people denied this, saying: “He cannot come as he must be weary from the fight of this day; therefore he must be sleeping.” Aikanaka said: “That is Kawelo’s voice that I hear chanting.” While they were disputing over this, Kawelo again chanted as follows:"
"A lohe o Aikanaka, hai aku la ia: “He mau kanaka no ko ka puu nei i koe. Eia na inoa o ia poe:","When Aikanaka heard this, he replied: “There are some people yet left on the hill, their names are:"
"Olelo hou mai o Aikanaka: “O na kanaka iho la no ia o ka puu i koe, aohe mahuahua, ua pau loa na kanaka i ka make . ” A pau ka hai ana aku a Aikanaka ia Kawelo, olelo aku la ia i kana mau kahuna, a me na kilo, ke kuhikuhipuuone: “E iho au e ike me Kawelo.” Wahi a Aikanaka i na kahuna: “Kai no paha no Kawelo nei aina e kaua mai nei, aole ka!

All the men are dead.” After Aikanaka had told Kawelo of this, he then addressed his priests, fortune-tellers and astrologers: “I must go down and meet Kawelo.” Said Aikanaka to the priests: “I thought this land that Kawelo is battling for belonged to him, but [I see] it is not. It is my own; I am above, he is underneath.” The priests then said to Aikanaka: “How can you go and meet Kawelo, for you are a king and he is a servant. His grandfather was nothing but a counter of cockroaches who lived in the uplands of Kulahuhu, Nahanaimoa by name.”"
"A lohe o Kawelo i keia olelo a na kahuna, kaa aku la ia i ka pali, a ike o Kanewahineikiaoha i ke kaa ana o Kawelo i ka pali, hoolei aku la ia i kana pikoi, a paa [ ] mai la o Kawelo.

Kai no e noonoo mua oe a maopopo he kauwa io; e ole au e ike aku nei ia oe, ina ua make oe.” Alaila, noonoo iho la o Kawelo a paha aku la, penei:","When Kawelo heard the remarks made by the priests, he rolled down the cliff. When Kanewahineikiaoha saw Kawelo roll down the cliff, she threw out her pikoi [ ] which Kawelo caught hold of. His wife asked him: “What is the matter with you, Kawelo?” Kawelo replied: “I was ashamed for you, because they said I was a born servant.” Kanewahineikiaoha then said: “How strange of you! You must first consider whether you are a born servant. Had I not seen you, you would have been killed.” Kawelo then thought for a while, and chanted as follows:"
"He ’lii ka moa, Kau ana ka moa i luna o ka hale, A hiia ko poo e Aikanaka O ka moa kou mea e ala ai, He ’lii ka moa e, he ’lii.","The chicken is the king, The chicken roosts on the house, And sits over your head, Aikanaka. The chicken wakes you up in the morning. The chicken is a king, it is a king."
"Ma keia paha ana a Kawelo, olelo aku o Aikanaka, i na kahuna: “Ke olelo mai nei o Kawelo, he ’lii ka moa.” I mai na kahuna ia Aikanaka: “E olelo aku oe ia Kawelo he kauwa ka moa.” A lohe o Kawelo i keia olelo a Aikanaka, paha aku la ia penei:","At the end of this chant, Aikanaka said to his priests: “Kawelo says that a chicken is a king.” The priests said to Aikanaka: “You tell Kawelo that chickens are servants.” When Kawelo heard these remarks repeated by Aikanaka, he again chanted as follows:"
"Haku ia nae hoi ka hulu o ka moa, I kahili i mua o na ’lii, Kahili ia nae hoi ko kua e Aikanaka; Nolaila, he ’lii ka moa. He lii ka moa e Aikanaka, Aohe kauwa e.","The feathers of the chickens are plaited Into kahili , that stand in the presence of kings. Your back, Aikanaka, is brushed by the kahili. Therefore chickens are kings, Chickens are kings, Aikanaka, And not servants."
"Mahope o keia paha ana a Kawelo, aohe walaau hou mai o luna o ka puu o Nounou, no ka mea, ua makau lakou ia Kawelo, a ua hele malu mai ka puu aku o Nounou, a uka o Hanapepe ma Koula, a malaila o Aikanaka i noho ai.","At the close of this chant, Kawelo heard no more replies from the top of the hill. This was because they were afraid of Kawelo, and they had secretly left the hill and had proceeded to the uplands of Hanapepe, at Koula, where Aikanaka took up his residence."
"A hiki o Kawelo i luna pono o ka puu o Nounou, me kana wahine me Kanewahineikiaoha, aohe io no he kanaka, aole hoi ke ’lii o Aikanaka. Ia wa pupuhi laua i ke ahi, a ike mai la o Kamalama, me na keiki, oia o Kaeleha me Kalaumeki.","When Kawelo and his wife arrived on the top of the hill, they saw no one, not even Aikanaka the king. Kawelo then lighted a fire which was seen by Kamalama and the adopted sons, Kaeleha and Kalaumeki."
"A lilo o Kauai ia Kawelo a puni, alaila, mahele maikai aku la ia i ka aina i kona mau kokua a hoalawehana ma ke kaua ana; aole oia i alunu a makee i ka aina a me ka waiwai. Penei ka mahele ana o Kawelo ia Kauai, no Kamalama, Kaeleha [ ] a me Kalaumeki: O Koolau no Kalaumeki; o Puna no Kaeleha; o Kona no Kamalama; o Kauai a puni no Kawelo.","After the conquest of Kauai by Kawelo, he proceeded to divide the lands equally between his followers and companions in arms. He did not act greedily and take all the best lands and the riches that came with the conquest. The following division of Kauai was made by Kawelo, to Kamalama, Kaeleha and Kalaumeki; Koolau to Kalaumeki; Puna to Kaeleha; Kona to Kamalama; the whole of Kauai to Kawelo. [ ]"
"Ma keia puni ana o Kauai ia Kawelo, noho iho la ia ma Hanamaulu, me kana wahine o Kanewahineikiaoha. O Aikanaka hoi, noho iho la ia ma Hanapepe me ka ilihune, aohe aina, aohe hanohano, aohe ai, aohe ia, aohe kapa, aohe hale. Hookahi a Aikanaka hana, o ka mahiai i ai na lakou.","After the conquest of Kauai, Kawelo and his wife Kanewahineikiaoha took up their residence in Hanamaulu. Aikanaka on the other hand lived in the uplands of Hanapepe and in great poverty. He had no lands, no honors, no food, no meat, no kapas and no home. All that Aikanaka did was to till the ground to raise food for their future use."
"Ia Aikanaka e noho ana i laila, hele aku la o Kaeleha mai Kapaa aku, ma ka aoao hikina o Kauai, a hiki ma ke komohana o Kauai ma Hanapepe, kahi o Aikanaka e noho ana. Ma kahi a Kaeleha i hiki mua ai, ma Wahiawa, i kahi o Ahulua e noho ana, i laila laua i hui ai me Aikanaka; ua hele mai ia mai Koula mai a laila, i ka lawaia a me ka auau kai.

Ma keia mau mea a Aikanaka i haawi mai ai ia Kaeleha, ua kuia kona manao, no ka hilahila i kana uku ole e uku ai ia Aikanaka.","While Aikanaka was living there, Kaeleha started out one day from Kapaa, on the east side of Kauai and traveled westward to Hanapepe where Aikanaka was living. It was at Wahiawa that Kaeleha first met Aikanaka, at the home of Ahulua. Aikanaka had come down from Koula to Wahiawa to fish and to take a swim in the sea. When Aikanaka saw Kaeleha, he called him in and set food and meat before him and Kawelowai, his daughter. After partaking of Aikanaka’s hospitality, Kaeleha was ashamed, because he had nothing to repay Aikanaka for his kindness. When Kaeleha left Aikanaka and continued on his journey, this thing dwelt on his mind for several days."
"Nolaila, hele makaikai aku la o Kaeleha a hiki i Mana, a lei i ka pahapaha o Polihale, hoi mai la a hiki i Wahiawa. Ma keia hoi ana o Kaeleha, aole i kipa i ko Kamalama wahi, no ka mea, ua komo kona makemake i ke kaikamahine a Aikanaka, oia o Kawelowai.

Nolaila, ua hilahila o Kaeleha i kona makuahunowai ia Aikanaka.","After reaching Mana and he had decorated himself with the pahapaha wreath of Polihale, he retraced his steps and again lingered at Wahiawa. On this return, he did not call in to see Kamalama, for the reason that he was anxious to get back and to again look upon Kawelowai. So in returning, he and Aikanaka went up to Koula in the uplands of Hanapepe, where Aikanaka made his residence. In this return to Koula, Kaeleha made a long visit and was therefore, to his idea, greatly indebted to his father-in-law, Aikanaka."
"Ike aku la o Kaeleha i ka hooikaika o kona makuahunowai, o Aikanaka, i ka po a me ke ao, hu ae la kona aloha. Ninau aku la o Kaeleha ia Aikanaka: “He nui no ka poe mahope ou, e kokua ana ia oe?” I mai la o Aikanaka: “He nui no.” A lohe o Kaeleha, olelo aku la ia ia Aikanaka: “Eia ko Kawelo kaua e make ai ia oe. Ke kaua, o ke kaua pohaku, no ka mea, aole i ao ia o Kawelo i ka alo.” A lohe o Aikanaka i keia olelo a Kaeleha, lana hou kona manao e kaua hou me Kawelo. Alaila, olelo iho o Aikanaka i kana olelo kaena, penei: “Ola na iwi i ka hunona.” [ ]","When Kaeleha saw how Aikanaka his father-in-law toiled by day and by night, he took pity on him and asked Aikanaka: “Are there many people who still think of you as king and who would help you in case you started an uprising?” Aikanaka replied: “Yes, many.” When Kaeleha heard this, he said: “I will tell you how you can beat Kawelo and how to fight him that you might win. If you fight him with stones, you will beat him, for Kawelo was never taught the art of avoiding stones thrown at him.” When Aikanaka heard this, he again entertained the idea of taking up another fight against Kawelo. He then made the boasting remark: “My bones are saved by my son-in-law.” [ ]"
"O ke kumu o keia kipi ana, o ka hilahila o Kaeleha i kona makuahunowai i kana waiwai ole e uku aku ai. Maanei e ike kakou i ke aloha ole o Kaeleha ia Kawelo, a me kona hilahila ole, aloha ole i kona mea nana i malama kupono a lilo ai i alii aimoku no Kauai.","The cause of the uprising then was because Kaeleha was ashamed on account of his father-in-law for not having anything with which to repay his great kindness. In this we can see how ungratefully Kaeleha acted toward Kawelo, and how he lacked all sense of honor and good feeling toward the one who had brought him up to his present high station and esteem, a chief of one of the districts of Kauai."
"Ma keia mau olelo a Kaeleha me Aikanaka, ua kui aku la ia olelo a lohe o Kawelo ma Hanamaulu, ma ka hikina o Kauai. Hoouna aku la o Kawelo i ka elele, e hele a loaa o Kamalama ma Kona, e hele mai e nana, e hoolohe, i ka oiaio a me ka ole o keia lohe.

Kawelo thereupon sent a messenger to Kamalama in Kona with instructions to go and see, and to find out for himself as to the truth of these rumors that had come to him. As soon as the messenger arrived in the presence of Kamalama, the message of his brother, Kawelo, was repeated to him. When Kamalama heard the instructions, he proceeded to Waimea, then on to Hanapepe and Wahiawa. When he reached Wahiawa, he saw a great number of people on the plain of Kalae gathering stones; men and women and children. While Kamalama was standing looking at the people, a man came up to him, so he asked: “What are the people doing over there on the plain?” The man replied: “They are gathering stones.” “Stones for what?” asked Kamalama. “For Kaeleha and Aikanaka to fight Kawelo.” Kamalama was thus made sure that the rumors heard by Kawelo were only too true. He then retraced his steps and went direct to his home and dispatched a messenger to Kawelo to inform him of what he had seen."
"A hiki aku la ka elele i mua o Kawelo ma Hanamaulu, hai aku la ia ia Kawelo, i ka hoomakaukau o Kaeleha a me Aikanaka i ka pohaku, no ke kaua hou. A lohe o Kawelo i keia mau olelo, komo mai la ka huhu wela loa ia Kawelo ia wa, no kana keiki no Kaeleha. Ia wa, hele mai la o Kawelo mai Hanamaulu mai a hiki i Wahiawa, ma kela aoao mai.

Aia ma na aoao o ka eho pohaku, na wahine me na pohaku i ka lima, a pela na keiki ma kekahi aoao o ka eho pohaku, me na pohaku i ka lima. Ua makaukau lakou a pau loa no ke kaua ana. O na mea kaua ma ko Kawelo lima, o ka laau palau no ana o Kuikaa, a me ka pikoi a kana wahine, a Kanewahineikiaoha. Nolaila, alua wale no ana mea kaua.","Upon the arrival of the messenger in the presence of Kawelo at Hanamaulu, he told him how Kaeleha and Aikanaka were making preparations, by gathering stones, for another conflict. When Kawelo heard this, a great anger welled up in him against his son, Kaeleha. He then immediately rose and proceeded to Wahiawa, which lies on the other side from Hanamaulu. When he arrived at Wahiawa, he saw several war canoes belonging to Kaeleha and Aikanaka, just back of the great mounds of stones. On the sides of the mounds of stones, he saw women and children with stones in their hands, and all were apparently ready for the conflict. All Kawelo had in his hands were his war club, Kuikaa, and his wife’s pikoi, two weapons to defend himself with."
"Ma keia kaua ana e ike ai kakou i ke koa a me ka ikaika lua ole o Kawelo, no ka mea, hookahi ia, a he nui mai kona mau enemi.

Nolaila, hooholo iho la lakou, o Aikanaka ke ’lii o Kauai a puni.","In this battle we will see how brave and powerful Kawelo really was, because, although he was all by himself, he fought against the multitude that opposed him. In the fight, Kawelo was not able to dodge the stones that were hurled at him, for a great many of them were thrown at the same time, therefore he stood in one place while the stones were hitting him from all sides. In course of time, Kawelo was completely covered by the stones, the stones rising until his height was reached. When Kawelo saw this, he pushed the stones from off him and for a time he would be free; but this was only for a very short while, for the stones would come so fast that again he would be covered. This was continued until Kawelo began to grow weaker and weaker, so that finally he was unable to push the stones away from him. After a while the mound [ ] of stones over Kawelo grew higher and higher, when at last nothing else could be seen but a great mound of stones which was like a grave for Kawelo. When the people saw that Kawelo was entirely covered over with stones, they believed that they had killed him, for they were sure that none could live in such a hail of stones as was cast at Kawelo. The people then ceased throwing and they came and took the stones from off of Kawelo. After a while he was found all bruised from head to feet and, to all appearances, lifeless. They then took up his body and began to beat it with clubs, after which they leaned over him and listened to see if he was alive or dead. After a while they made sure that Kawelo was indeed dead, and they proclaimed that Aikanaka was the king of Kauai."
"Ma keia hailukuia ana o Kawelo, he mea kupanaha loa ia ma ka noonoo ana iho, i ko Kawelo make ole i loko o keia kaua ana. Ua uuku loa kona wahi ola i koe, aole nui loa, a he wahi hanu uuku no hoi i koe i loko ona, aole nae he ike ia, nolaila, ua pakele oia i ka pepehi maoli ia e kona mau enemi. He wahi maalea no ia o Kawelo, ma ka wa i huli ia ai kona hanu e na enemi.","In this battle and the subsequent beating with clubs, it turned out strange that after all Kawelo was not really killed. It seemed that he still had a little spark of life within him, and in course of time he came to life again. But this was not known; consequently, his enemies were prevented from killing him outright. Kawelo was aware that, if he showed any signs of life when they examined him, he would be killed, so he pretended to be dead."
"O ka unu, he lele ia e kau ai ke kanaka, a me ka puaa, ka maia, ka ia, ka awa, a me na mea a pau loa. Ua hana o Aikanaka he unu nana ma Maulili, aia ia wahi ma Koloa a hiki i keia la.

Eia wale no kona manao ia wa, o ka pepehi aku i kona mau enemi a pau loa i ka make, oia no kana keiki, o Kaeleha, o Aikanaka.","This temple of Aikanaka’s was made by him as a place to offer sacrifices in, such as human beings, pigs, bananas, fish, awa and other things. Aikanaka therefore had this temple built for his gods, at Maulili, Koloa, and this place can be seen to this day. But since its completion no human sacrifice had been offered upon its altar. Kawelo was therefore carried from Wahiawa to Koloa. The distance from Wahiawa to Koloa is something like the distance between Honolulu and Luakaha, about six miles. When Kawelo’s body was at last brought to the temple, it was carried and left within the enclosure that stood inside of the temple, near the altar, with the idea of leaving it there over night, before placing it on the altar the next day, for the shades of night were already falling. Kawelo was therefore left in the enclosure, covered over with banana leaves. After remaining in a deep sleep as it were for some time, Kawelo woke up and felt that he was greatly relieved from his bruises. He also felt that his strength had returned to him, and gradually he realized that he was at last saved from a terrible death. He then planned how he was to deal out his vengeance to all his enemies and particularly his son Kaeleha and Aikanaka."
"Maanei e ike ai kakou i ke ola hou ana o Kawelo, a me kona lanakila ana maluna o kona mau enemi.

In the night when Kawelo was lying covered up with banana leaves, at about midnight, [ ] at the time when the Milky Way turns, Kawelo felt his strength returning to him and his bruises became less painful. He therefore rose and walked back and forth, impatiently waiting for the coming of day, when he expected to see Aikanaka and Kaeleha and the others enter the temple. Where Aikanaka and his followers had gone to spend the night was at a place some distance away, but before leaving he had placed a guard over Kawelo. This guard was a close friend of Kawelo’s. When Kawelo rose, the man saw that he was come back to life again, so he asked: “Is that you?” Kawelo answered: “Yes, it is I.” Kawelo then asked the guard: “Where are Aikanaka and his followers?” The guard replied: “They have retired for the night.” Kawelo again asked: “Are they not coming back again?” The guard replied: “They are coming back here in the morning.”"
"E kau ia oe i ka lele, A e mohai ia oe na ke ’kua, A i kanaka oe no ka unu; Eia ka e ola mai ana oe.","To place you on the altar And to sacrifice you to the gods, That you may serve as the human offering for the temple. But it seems you have come to life."
"I aku la o Kawelo i ke kiai: “E ala iki kaua a liuliu, hoi au e moe. A i moe au, e uhi oe ia’u i ka lau maia a paa e like me mamua, a hiki i ke ao ana. E nana oe i ko lakou komo ana i loko nei, a ike oe ua pau loa i ke komo, alaila, kii ae oe ia’u e hoala ae, a e luku aku au ia lakou a pau loa i ka make.”","Kawelo then said to the guard: “Let us sit up for a while before I retire. After I lay down, cover me up again with the banana leaves just as before until daylight. I want you to watch the people as they come into the temple. When you see that all have entered, come and wake me and I shall then slay them all.”"
"A pau ka olelo ana a Kawelo i ke kiai, hoi aku la ia moe, uhi aku la ke kiai ia ia i ka lau maia a paa, mai na wawae o Kawelo a ke poo.

On being again covered up Kawelo did not go to sleep, nor was he in any way unwatchful, in fact, he was very vigilant and was very anxious to meet his enemies, when he would mete out death to them. Kawelo became very restless and anxious for daylight to come, that he might set eyes on Aikanaka and the others. Early that morning Kawelo waited for the coming of Aikanaka and his followers, but the people were slow in making their appearance. It was about noon before Aikanaka and his followers appeared. When the guard saw that Aikanaka, Kaeleha, the chiefs, the warriors and the people, men, women and children, had all come into the temple enclosure, he approached the side of Kawelo and whispered to him, saying:"
"E Kawelo e, e Kawelo e, E ala oe, e ala oe, Ua komo ae la o Aikanaka, Ua komo o Kaeleha, Ua komo na ’lii, Ua komo na koa, Ua komo na kane, Ua komo na wahine, Ua komo na keiki, Ua pau loa i loko nei; E ala, e wiki oe, mai lohi.

Aikanaka has entered, Kaeleha has entered, The chiefs have entered, The warriors have entered, The men have entered, The women have entered, The children have entered, All have entered. Wake up, you must hasten, don’t be slow. [ ]"
"A lohe o Kawelo i ka olelo a ke kiai, wikiwiki ae la ia i ke kiola i ka lau maia, ma o a maanei ona. Ia Kawelo e ala ana a kiola, kahea mai la ke kanaka kiai ia loko a pau loa:","When Kawelo heard the call of the guard, he hastily threw off the banana leaves from his body. While Kawelo was doing this, the guard again called out to the people that had come in:"
"A lohe lakou i keia leo o ke kiai, huli mai la lakou e nana ia Kawelo, a ike lakou, kau mai la ka makau a me ka weliweli maluna o lakou. Ia wa i hoomaka hou ai lakou e kaua me Kawelo. A kokoke mai la o Kawelo, paha mai la ia no Kaeleha a me Aikanaka; penei ua paha la:","When the people heard the guard calling out, they all turned and looked at Kawelo. When they saw him, they all became possessed of a great fear, and preparations for a battle with Kawelo were hastily made. As Kawelo approached the people, he chanted to Aikanaka and Kaeleha as follows:"
"E Kaeleha keiki a’u nei la, I hanai maikai ia e a’u a nui; O ke aha ka’u hala i kipi ai oe, I lalau ai oe i ka mea hope ole he kipi? Pau ke ola la i keia la, Make i ka makua la, Ia Kaweloleimakua.

Your life is ended this day, Taken by your father, By Kaweloleimakua. Say, Aikanaka! You shall be Kawelo’s prisoner. This is the day to be brave, be you therefore brave, The day when one shall either die or live. Death I fear shall be your portion."
"A waiho o Kawelo i ka paha ana, luku aku la ia ia lakou a pau loa i ka make, aohe mea i koe. Alaila, puni hou o Kauai ia Kawelo, a noho alii iho la ia e like me mamua, a hoi aku la ia i Hanamaulu e noho ai me kona mau makua, a me kana wahine.","Kawelo then ceased chanting and began the slaughter, killing every one; none escaped. Kauai therefore once more came under the rule of Kawelo, and he again assumed the reins of power. He then returned to Hanamaulu where he lived with his parents and his wife."
"Maanei pau ka moolelo kaulana o Kawelo, a koe paha kekahi ma na keena opu o ka lehulehu. [ ]","Here endeth the famous legend of Kawelo, except some perhaps in the minds of the people. [ ]"
"He Kaao no Pakaa.

"He Kauwa o Pakaa na Keawenuiaumi, ke ’lii nui o Hawaii, he kanaka punahele loa o Pakaa i kona haku, ia ia ka hooponopono o na aina a me na ai alo o Keawenuiaumi. Ia ia no hoi ka malama o na mea a pau a ke ’lii, ke kapa, ka ai, ka ia, ka malo, ke kahili, ke kanoa, ka apu awa, ka awa, ka ipu kakele, a me na mea a pau loa o Keawenuiaumi.","Pakaa was the servant of Keawenuiaumi, the king of Hawaii, and was a very great favorite with his master. It was his duty to have the supervision of the lands and household servants of the king. It was also his duty to have in his keeping all of the king’s personal effects; the kapas, the food, the meat and fish, the malos, the feather kahilis, awa bowls, awa cups, awa, the calabash containing ointment and all the different things belonging to the comfort of Keawenuiaumi."
"No ka malama pono o Pakaa i na mea a pau loa, nolaila, ua kiekie kona punahele ia Keawenuiaumi, maluna o na ’lii a me na kanaka a pau loa. Ua haawi aku o Keawenuiaumi i mau aina hou no Pakaa, i loko o na moku eono o Hawaii.","Because of the great care exercised by Pakaa in the supervision of the things belonging to the king, he was raised to the highest office in the king’s household and he became a greater favorite than all the chiefs and men under the king. In time the king gave Pakaa several pieces of land in the six different districts of Hawaii for his own use."
"A ia Pakaa no hoi ka hookele o ko Keawenuiaumi waa, ia ia ka holo a me ka ole, ka malie a me ka ino, o ka Pakaa e olelo ai, oia ka ke ’lii e hooko ai. O Lapakahoe, oia ka hoe a Pakaa, a e hookele ai i ka waa o ke ’lii, ke hiki i ka wa holo.

Lapakahoe was the name given to Pakaa’s paddle, which was the only one used by him while guiding the king’s canoe. Laamaomao was the name of the calabash of wind belonging to Pakaa; it was a real calabash [gourd] entirely covered over with wicker work, plaited like a basket, and it was named in honor of the mother of Pakaa. In this calabash were kept the bones of his mother, Laamaomao. This calabash was given the name of “the wind calabash of Laamaomao” because during the life time of Laamaomao, the winds obeyed her every call and command."
"Oia na kauwa a Keawenuiaumi i lawe hou ai, a hoowahawaha iho la ia Pakaa; lawe ae la i na mea a pau loa mai ka lima ae o Pakaa, a haawi aku la ia Hookeleihilo a me Hookeleipuna, koe nae na pono kino o ke ’lii ia Pakaa.

Ua kapa ia kana hoe i kona kaikaina ia Lapakahoe.","These two were new men taken up by Keawenuiaumi, whereby Pakaa was disrated by the king and in time all the powers and privileges that were formerly Pakaa’s were taken out of his hands and given over to these two men, Hookeleihilo and Hookeleipuna, except the personal effects of the king; these the king left with Pakaa. Because of this want of faith in him, Pakaa left the presence of the king and wandered off heavy hearted and in great grief over the actions of the king, for he did not want to be ordered about by anyone. In this departure of Pakaa he took with him the kapas, malos and all the personal effects of Keawenuiaumi and placed them within his calabash, Laamaomao. He [ ] also took with him his paddle, called Lapakahoe, so named in honor of his younger brother, Lapakahoe."
"Olelo aku o Pakaa i kona kaikaina ia Lapakahoe: “E noho alii ana no kekahi mau aina o Hilo, ua hoowahawaha ka haku o kaua ia’u, ua lawe aku i na pono a pau loa, a koe no he mau aina, mahope paha pau loa, nolaila, a i pau kou noho aina ana, noho a kanaka aku no malalo o ka haku o kaua. Nolaila, ke hele nei au, aole i akaka ko’u wahi e noho ai.”","When Pakaa was about to leave, he said to his younger brother, who was a chief in possession over certain lands in the district of Hilo: “Our master somehow is displeased with me and has taken back everything I once owned, leaving me only a few pieces of land, which I suppose he will take away by and by. Since I am going away I want you to live on your lands; but be faithful to our master. I am going away now, but am not certain where I shall locate.”"
"Kau aku la o Pakaa ma ka waa a holo mai la, a hala o Maui a me Lele, a hiki i Molokai, ma ka huli ma Kona, e nana ala ia Lanai, noho iho la o Pakaa ilaila, a moe i ke ’lii wahine o ia aina, a hapai ke keiki, a hanau, kapa iho la o Pakaa i ka inoa, o Kuapakaa. Eia ke ano o ia inoa, o ke akaakaa mahuna, o ka ili o Keawenuiaumi i ka awa, a waiho wale mai ka io me he pakaa la.","With these words, he boarded his canoe and set out, going by way of Lele, Maui; then on until he came to Molokai; on the Kona side of that island, overlooking Lanai, where Pakaa made his home, and took unto himself a wife, a chiefess, belonging to the land. In time his wife bore him a boy and he gave the child the name of Kuapakaa. The meaning of the name is this: “the cracked skin,” given because the skin of Keawenuiaumi was cracked by the constant use of the awa, so much so that the flesh was exposed in places."
"A loaa ia Kuapakaa ka olelo, olelo aku o Pakaa: “E ao kaua ia oe i ke mele o ko haku, a me na mea a pau loa, malama o noho a aloha imi mai, e noho aku ana oe me ka makaukau.” Aole i loihi na la o laua i ao ai, ua pau loa i ka loaa ia Kuapakaa, a ua lilo ia i mea wale waha ia ia i na la a pau loa.","After Kuapakaa had grown up to the age when he could talk and think, Pakaa said to him: “I want to teach you the meles relating to your master and also the general knowledge of all things; for it is possible that in time he will miss me and will come to make a search; if he does I want you to be in a position of readiness to meet him.” The course of instruction did not take many days, for Kuapakaa was a bright boy and everything was mastered in a way that gave him a thorough knowledge of the different subjects."
"Mahope o laila, pae mai la kekahi waa mai Hilo mai, a olelo mai la i ke aloha o Keawenuiaumi ia Pakaa, aole nae ia i olelo i kona inoa i ua waa ala.",A short time after this a canoe came in from Hilo and word was brought that Keawenuiaumi was beginning to feel keenly the loss of Pakaa. Pakaa during the recital of this piece of news did not tell the Hilo man that he was Pakaa himself.
"A mahope o keia lohe ana, moe iho la o Pakaa i ka moe uhane, a ma ka uhane, ua loaa ko Keawenuiaumi uhane ia Pakaa. I mai la o Keawenuiaumi: “Eia au a huli aku ia oe.” I aku o Pakaa: “Aia au i Kaula kahi i noho ai.” Hikilele o Keawenuiaumi, a olelo i na ’lii eono o Hawaii, e makaukau na waa a me na kanaka, alaila, imi ia Pakaa, no ka hemahema o Hookeleihilo ma na hana a pau loa.","After the information had been imparted to Pakaa he dreamed a dream in which his spirit met the spirit of Keawenuiaumi . In this meeting the spirit of Keawenuiaumi said to his spirit: “I am coming in search of you.” The spirit of Pakaa answered: “I am living on Kaula.” Keawenuiaumi also dreamed the same dream and on receiving the reply from Pakaa, jumped out of his bed and immediately requested of the six district chiefs of Hawaii to get their canoes ready and to summon their attendants; for he wished them to accompany him in his search for Pakaa, for he had at last realized the utter lack of knowledge, in most cases of Hookeleihilo and Hookeleipuna, the men that took the place of Pakaa."
"Ala ae la no hoi o Pakaa, a olelo i ke keiki, e pii e mahiai; ae mai la ke keiki. Ma keia pii ana a laua, eono mala, he uwala ka ai, ua hoohalike ia me na moku eono o Hawaii. [ ]",Pakaa awoke from his sleep and said to his son: “Let us go to the uplands and do our farm work.” The boy consented and the two started up. Their fields were six in number and the food planted was sweet potatoes. Each field was shaped after each of the six districts of Hawaii. [ ]
"A makaukau o Keawenuiaumi e holo mai, loaa hou ia Pakaa ma ka moeuhane ko Keawenuiaumi uhane, I mai o Keawenuiaumi: “Aia a na la o Ku, holo aku au e imi ia oe.” Hikilele ae la o Pakaa, a olelo aku la i ke keiki: “E pii kaua i uka i lau hawane” (oia ka loulu). Ua nui loa ko laua amo ana i ka lau hawane, i mea malumalu ua, ke hiki i na ku, ua piha kekahi hale o laua.","When the preparations were finally completed and Keawenuiaumi was ready to make the start, Pakaa again dreamed a dream wherein his spirit again met the spirit of Keawenuiaumi, which said to him: “In the days of Ku, I will set out on my search for you.” Pakaa awoke with a start and said to his son: “Let us go to the uplands for palm leaves.” With this the two proceeded to the uplands and cut down a large number of palm leaves and much time was spent by them in bringing the leaves to the beach and a whole house was filled with them. The leaves were to be used in the rainy days of Ku."
"A hiki i na ku, holo aku la laua i ka moana e kali ai i na waa o Keawenuiaumi. Mamua o Pakaa o ko laua waa, mahope ke keiki, he lawaia uhu ka Pakaa lawaia, manao ia, o kona wahi ia e nalo ai, no ka mea, he lawaia kulou i lalo ka uhu. A ua lawe pu no hoi laua ia Laamaomao i kai, ma keia holo ana, a hiki laua, puka ana na waa. [ ]","In the Ku days, Pakaa and his son boarded their canoe and set out to sea to await the coming of Keawenuiaumi. Pakaa sat in the front seat of their canoe, while the boy took the hind seat. The two took up uhu fishing as the kind to be engaged in, Pakaa thinking this the best kind of fishing in order to prevent him from being discovered, for one has to keep on looking down when fishing for uhu. On this trip they took the wind calabash, Laamaomao. As soon as they arrived out at sea the canoes in the advance of the expedition were seen to be approaching. [ ]"

The name of Kuapakaa was given to the boy after the father. As the boy grew up the father educated him in all the things pertaining to the office of an immediate servant under the king; and also in the different branches of learning of those days until his education was complete. After Kuapakaa had been educated in these things, they went to the shore to await the coming of Keawenuiaumi in his search of Pakaa. In the trip out [to meet Keawenuiaumi], Pakaa’s paddle, Lapakahoe, was taken by Kuapakaa, who took the important seat, the one in the stern, while Pakaa took the front seat. When they saw the canoes coming, Pakaa kept his eyes down, making believe that he was looking for uhu, with his long hair let down over his eyes. They were in this position when the canoes came along; some with two men, some with three men and so on; some bearing the food and stewards, some the commanding officers, some the women and some the warriors."
"Ninau aku o Kuapakaa i ka makuakane ia Pakaa: “Auhea ka waa o kuu haku?” I mai o Pakaa: “Aia a o ke kukuna o ka la, holo mai ka waa o ko haku. Eia ke ano o kona waa. Ua aki ia ka pea ma waena, i mea e maopopo ai kona akua, ke ku mai, o Kaili ka inoa, a he lumi kiekie mamua, a mawaena, malaila ko haku, a mahope na hookele.”","When the canoes were approaching them, Kuapakaa asked of his father, Pakaa: “Where is the canoe containing my master?” Pakaa replied: “When the rays of the sun make their appearance, then the canoe bearing your master will come. The signs by which you will know his canoe are these: The sail is doubled down, so that his god could be seen, Kaili by name, standing at its place. You will also see a high compartment in front in the middle of the raised platform; there your master sits; the sailing masters are directly behind him.”"
"Ia laua e kamailio ana, holo mai ana ka waa o Keawenuiaumi, hinuhinu ana na aoao o ka waa i ka loaa i ke kukuna o ka la, a lilelile ana ka hoe a na hoewaa i ka la. I aku la ia i kona makuakane: “Eia kuu haku.” “Aia mahea?” “Aia ma waho o kaua.” I aku o Pakaa: “Oku ia ko hoe i luna.” Ia oku ana o ka hoe, ike mai la o Lapakahoe, e ku ana i luna o na waa o ke ’lii, hai ae la ia i ke ’lii: “E!

Alaila, kahea o Kuapakaa:","While the two were conversing, the canoe of Keawenuiaumi was seen approaching with its sides glittering, being struck by the sun’s rays while the paddles of the rowers were bathed in light. When Kuapakaa saw the signs as described by his father, he said: “Here comes my master.” “Whereabouts?” “On the outside of us.” Pakaa said, “Hold up your paddle.” When this was done, Lapakahoe who was standing up in the king’s canoe saw it and so reported to the king, saying: “Say, there is a small canoe floating there inside of us; some one is holding up a paddle.” Keawenuiaumi then said to the sailing masters: “Point the bow of the canoe for the small canoe; possibly it has [ ] a word for us.” The reason why the king said this was because while Pakaa had command of his canoe, it was his custom to make a call on any canoe that made signals of this kind; hence the king being accustomed with this, ordered that the canoe be directed for the small one. When the king’s canoe drew near, Pakaa asked of his son: “Where is the canoe of your master?” The boy replied: “It is here near us.” “Then question your master as to his reason of being here,” said Pakaa. Kuapakaa then called out:"
"Kipu la, kipu! Hoolai la, hoolai! Hoopohu la, hoopohu! Hoomalino la, hoomalino! Ouiu, o ninau, nowai he waa?","Hold back there! Hold back! Be still there! Be still! Be calm there! Be calm! Gently there! Gently! The query, the question, whose the canoe?"
"“No Keawenuiaumi he waa.” Ninau aku ke keiki: “He waa e holo ana i hea?” “He waa e holo ana e imi ia Pakaa.” “Imi ia Pakaa, heaha o Pakaa?” “He kauwa.” I aku o Kuapakaa i kona makuakane, ia Pakaa: “Ka i no he ’lii oe, he kauwa ka oe.

I see that you are a servant. Well, what of that any way? Supposing you are a servant. I am a chief on my mother’s side and shall continue to be so as long as I live in Molokai.” Pakaa said to the boy: “Ask them again if he is a real servant.” Kuapakaa therefore asked: “Is he a real servant?” “No, he is not a real servant, but a backbone, a holder of the kahili and bearer of the king’s calabash of ointment.” By this answer the boy was satisfied that his father was, after all, of chiefly grade; so he said to his father: “Your rank as a chief and my mother’s position as a chiefess, make me a chief of some importance and I shall live as such, here in Molokai.”"
"No na ’lii malalo o Keawenuiaumi, oia na ’lii aimoku o Hawaii, eono moku, eono alii.

Before Kuapakaa spoke to the canoe of Keawenuiaumi, he first called each of the six chiefs by name, in their order, for Pakaa had already instructed his son in everything pertaining to them. Wahilani’s was the first canoe, it being a beautifully made double one; Kuapakaa asked his father as to its owner. The father answered: “That is the canoe of Wahilani, the district chief of Kohala.” Kuapakaa then chanted:"
"O ua alii o makou o Kohala, o Wahilani. Aole no hoi he ’lii, he kaukau alii no, He peepee puko no Kohala, Ka ia o ia aina, he unihi, I ka lau o ke ko, i ka pua o ka mauu.

He is not a chief by birth, he is a petty chief, One who played hide and seek in the sugar cane hills of Kohala. The fish of that land are the grasshoppers, On the leaf of the sugar cane, on the grass blade. It is a land without fish, And the food is the sweet potato, That is the fault found against the land. Wahilani is not a chief; Being a ruler of Kohala, He has been called a chief. [ ]"
"Ma keia olelo a ke keiki, huhu o Wahilani, a olelo aku la: “I nahea kou ike ana, e na keiki hoopunipuni?” Nolaila holo o Wahilani.","By these words of the boy, Wahilani was made very angry and so he made reply: “When did you ever know that, you deceitful boy?” With this Wahilani set off."
"O Ehu ka waa alua. Hoea hou he waa kaulua maikai, o Ehu ia, o ke ’lii o Kona. Ninau aku o Kuapakaa i ka makuakane: “No wai keia waa?” “No Ehu ke ’lii o Kona.” Ia manawa, oli aku la no o Kuapakaa:","The second canoe was Ehu’s. Another beautiful double canoe came along, the one belonging to Ehu, the chief of Kona. On the approach of this canoe, Kuapakaa asked of his father: “Whose canoe is that?” “It is the canoe of Ehu, the chief of Kona.” Kuapakaa then chanted out:"
"O ua ’lii o makou o Kona, o Ehu, aohe alii; O ka hele ana aku o Keawenuiaumi a noho i Kiholo, Iho mai o Ehu me na kiki uala, A haawi i ke ’lii.

Ehu then became an adopted son, And Keawenuiaumi gave him Kona, Therefore Ehu became a chief."
"Ma keia olelo a Kuapakaa huhu loa o Ehu, a olelo aku la: “He oi oe o ke keiki hoopunipuni; i hea kou ike ana i ko makou ano?” Holo aku ia me ka huhu.","Because of this chant of Kuapakaa, Ehu became angry and said: “You are the most conceited boy I know of. Where did you ever know of me?” With this he sailed off in a rage."
"O Huaa ka waa akolu. Hoea hou mai la he waa. Ninau o Kuapakaa i ka makuakane: “Owai keia waa?” “O Huaa, o ke ’lii o Kau.” Oli mai la o Kuapakaa:","The third canoe was Huaa’s. As this canoe approached Kuapakaa asked of his father: “Whose canoe is this?” “It is the canoe of Huaa, the chief of Kau.” Kuapakaa then chanted as follows:"
"O ua ’lii o makou o Kau, o Huaa, Aohe alii, he kaukau alii no. He kaka lau ilima no Kamaoa, Ka wai auau no ia o ia aina, A o ko laila kee no ia, Ua noho au i laila a ike.","Our chief of Kau, Huaa, He is not a chief [by birth], but a petty chief. He is a beater of the ilima of Kamaoa; By this way the people of that land get water to wash in, And it is the main fault of that land For I have lived there and know."
"O Hikinaakala ka waa aha. Hoea hou mai la he waa hou, ninau no keia ia Pakaa, hai mai la no, o ke ’lii o Puna, o Hikinaakala. Oli mai la o Kuapakaa:","The fourth was the canoe of Hikinaakala. Another canoe approached, and the boy asked of Pakaa, and was told that it was the chief of Puna, Hikinaakala. Kuapakaa then chanted:"
"O ua ’lii o makou o Puna, o Hikinaakala, aohe alii, He makakokala, lauhahala ooi; O ka ai ana ia Puna, Olelo ia ai he alii, Aohe alii.","Our chief of Puna, Hikinaakala, is not a chief [by birth]; He is like the prickly edges of the hala leaf; But since he became possessed of Puna, He is said to be a chief. He is not a chief."
"O Kulukulua ka waa alima.

As it approached Kuapakaa again inquired of his father: “Whose canoe is this?” “That is the canoe of Kulukulua, the chief of Hilo.” Kuapakaa then chanted as follows: [ ]"
"O ua ’lii o makou o Hilo, o Kulukulua, aohe alii; He pahelehele opae no Waiakea; A pau ke pahelehele ana, Kau ae la i ka pulu niu i ka pepeiao. O ke kee no hoi ia o ia aina, O ka ai ana ia Hilo, Olelo ia ai he ’lii.","Our chief of Hilo, Kulukulua, is not a chief [by birth]; He is a snarer of the shrimps of Waiakea; After the snaring, He places the outside covering of the coconut on his ears. This is the fault of the land; But since he became possessed of Hilo, He is called a chief."
"O Wanua ka waa aono. Hoea hou he waa, ninau no ia Pakaa, hai mai la no o Pakaa: “O Wanua, o ke ’lii o Hamakua.”","The sixth was the canoe of Wanua. Upon its approach the boy asked of Pakaa as to its owner, and Pakaa replied: “It is Wanua, the chief of Hamakua.”"
"O ua ’lii o makou o Hamakua, o Wanua, Aole alii maoli; He pahelehele puhi no Hamakua, Waiho aku na manamana lima i ka paala me ka maunu, Pii mai la ka puhi a komo i na manamana Hoolei iho la i ka ipu.

The fingers with the bait are placed on the rocks, The small eels would then crawl between the fingers And the eels placed in the calabash. But since he became possessed of Hamakua He is called a chief. He is not a chief."
"Pau na ’lii i ka holo i mua, me ko lakou inaina i ke keiki, i ka hoole ia lakou aohe alii, a i ka hai i ke kee o ka aina.","These chiefs all went on, and all angry with the boy, because he had told them that they were not chiefs by birth, and also for telling the faults relating to their respective districts."
"(Maanei e hoomaka ai ka olelo no ka waa o Keawenuiaumi i olelo mua ia ae nei: aka, no ka olelo mua ana mai o ka mea malama kaao mahope o keia; nolaila, ua kau e ia na olelo no Keawenuiaumi a me kona waa mamua, aka, he pono no e noonoo i ka heluhelu ana, a malaila e maopopo ai, he mua na waa o na ’lii eono o Hawaii.)","(We will now take up the facts relating to the canoe of Keawenuiaumi, aforementioned, which the narrator said should be inserted later, and was therefore out of place; care, however, should be taken in its perusal by which it may be plainly seen that the six canoes bearing the district chiefs were the first to meet the canoe of Kuapakaa.)"
"O Lapakahoe ka mea nana i olelo mai no Keawenuiaumi ka waa; nolaila, paha aku ai o Kuapakaa, penei:","It was Lapakahoe, the younger brother of Pakaa, that replied to the question, that it was the canoe of Keawenuiaumi. At this reply Kuapakaa chanted as follows:"

Like a slanting cliff, dark and black Is the top of the Aluli mountain, because of the storm, Like black raiment that is worn Is the face of the cliffs of Kawaikapu. Running as though seeking every crevice Is the water that comes. The mountains appear to be filled, The sound is heard in the heaven, The voice is echoed back, The voice of the weeping sea, [ ] Urging onward the rising sea. Like the clouds at Kikiopua Is the flying and swimming outrigger of Malelewaa. The burden is swung to the back, Kaula looks as though climbing from behind. The cliffs of Wailau are joined and plated one on top of another, They are joined and plated, On the top of Pueohulunui, The cliffs where the owls fly."

Comes the rain, the wind, the storm, From Puulenalena, from Hilo, From Hokukano, from Waiolomea, From the raising of the paddle from under the buttock, At the thought, at the pebbles, At the cutting down of the iako, at Kainaliu, The iako at the rear, At the opening between the two sailing masters. Get up from your seats, Take out your paddles, Pull up the weight, Watch for the waves As they twist and rise, As the waves twist and beat On the outside of the canoe; The wave is become quiet at the bow, Swing the canoe around and let the wave pass between, The water on the outside meet at the opening, The wave is a welcome thing to a castaway. But here I am, O death! Death to you is the small wave, Death to you is the large wave, Death to you is the long wave, Death to you is the short wave, The follower of Kuloku , The roaring, the trembling, The oopu , the lauloa , The waves that open up, The waves that will perchance open up my canoe. It will swamp. Because of the swamping of the small canoe, The large canoe will also swamp. Bind the paddles together, For they will be the only burden of a swamped canoe; The small paddle, the large paddle, The long paddle, the short paddle; [ ] The small bailing cup, the large bailing cup, The long bailing cup, the short bailing cup, The coarse bailing cup, the thin bailing cup. After rescuing the several things from the swamped canoe, Comes the thought to refloat the canoe. That block of wood, this block of wood [the waves], That rope is drawn, this rope is drawn; Some will rush there, some will rush here, The large wave will rise, The small wave will break, The sticks at the bow will fly off, The sticks at the stern will fly off. The priest is at last separated [from the king], The connection is become of no value, on a day of peril, The sea separates them, the cold is intense, The uku is softened, that snub-nosed thing, Your reputation, ye sailing masters, Ye prophet and priest, is injured. Had the sailing masters seen the star You would have reached land."

These men all assured the king that the words of the boy were void of the truth and were entirely false. By this assurance the king’s fear disappeared and he gave way to their advice, therefore the boy again chanted:"
"Uhi ia ae la na maka e ke kai! Pale ka ike i ka lalani o ka moku. Make eia i na Ku, I na la wehe o ke au i waho.

Shall we land as requested by the boy, for he says, if we continue we will return to Hawaii in spirit?” The sailing masters replied: “Who is going to land on such a fine day?” [ ]"
"Ua paihi o luna, Ua maloo wai ole ka nahelehele, Ua hoi ke ao a ke kuahiwi, Ua hoi ka makani a Kumukahi, Ua hoi ka opua a Awalua, Ua hoi ka pauli makani kualau, Ua hoi ka waa hooulu he kaikoo, Ua hoi ka waa i ka lae makani, Ua hoi ke kai ka wai a Manawainui, No hea hoi ka ino a ia keiki?","The heavens are cloudless, The shrubs are without moisture, The clouds have returned to the mountains, The wind has returned to Kumukahi, The pointed clouds have returned to Awalua, The soft breezes are wafting over the waves, The canoes have gone, a raging surf has arisen, The canoes have gone to the windy cape, The sea and the water have returned to Manawainui, Whence is the storm to come as predicted by the boy?"
"Ia wa, ninau mai o Lapakahoe: “I loaa ia oe, ia wai?” “He mea loaa wale no ia i kamalii o keia aina o Molokai.” Olelo mai o Lapakahoe: “Aole i loaa na ia hai, aole ia Kahikiokamoku, ke aikane punahele a ke ’lii; elua wale no maua i loaa na mele, owau, o ko’u kaikuaana o Pakaa, i haku no maua no ko maua haku no Keawenuiaumi.” Alaila, ninau mai la Lapakahoe: “Ina ua ike oe eia o Pakaa i uka nei, e hai mai oe?” “Aole ia kanaka ia nei, ua lohe nae makou aia i Kaula kahi i noho ai.” Nolaila hooki o Lapakahoe i ka olelo, a manao iho la ia he oiaio ka olelo a Keawenuiaumi, i loaa ai ma ka moe uhane i Hawaii.","At this, Lapakahoe asked of the boy: “Who gave you such knowledge?” The boy replied: “Such learning is common with the small boys of this land of Molokai.” Lapakahoe said: “Such knowledge was not imparted to you from any one else, not even by Kahikiokamoku, the king’s favorite friend; there are only two of us who have acquired such knowledge, myself and my elder brother, Pakaa. We composed those lines in honor of our master Keawenuiaumi.” Lapakahoe then asked of the boy: “If you know the whereabouts of Pakaa above here, you must tell us.” “There is no such man here, but we have heard that he is living on Kaula” [replied the boy]. This ended Lapakahoe’s remarks and he thought that the information given by Keawenuiaumi, relating to Pakaa as living on Kaula, was the truth after all. This information was given in a dream."
"Kahea mai na hookele, e hoe o mua me hope; hoole o Lapakahoe, no ka mea, ua nanea o Lapakahoe i ka olelo a ke keiki.

When Pakaa saw that the canoe was preparing to leave, he requested the boy to continue chanting."

The umbilicus of the rain is in the heaven, The streams will yet be swollen by the rain, The roar of thunder, the shock of the earthquake, The flashing of the lightning in the heaven. The light rain, the heavy rain, The prolonged rain, the short rain. The rain in the winter comes slanting, Taking the breath away, pressing down the hair, Parting the hair in the middle. One sleeps doubled up, one sleeps with the face up. When anger rises, the hand acts tardily. Trouble has overcome thee, stubborn master. See, ye sailing masters, it has come; Trouble will overtake you in mid ocean, [ ] You have gone out to sea and have become castaways, You are spoken of as castaways. You will cut out hooks from the teeth of sharks, And fasten them to the fish-line, the fish will bite, The paka eel, the ulua, [For] Kaulua is the month. Take good care of the favorite son, Else he will be washed away by the sea of Kaulua.

Where are the clouds? Where are the pointed clouds? Where is the rain? Where is the wind? Where is the lightning? Where is the thunder, whereby we would know that the boy is telling the truth? This day will land us in Kaula and you shall see your servant Pakaa.”"
Olelo aku o Kuapakaa i ka makuakane: “Ke olelo ae la ua poe kanaka nei i ke ’lii e holo no.” I aku Pakaa i ke keiki: “Kahea ia ko Hawaii makani.”,Kuapakaa said to his father: “The men are advising the king to go on.” Pakaa said to the boy: “Call out for the winds of Hawaii.”

Place the burden on the back, Thus a load is given to the swamped canoe. Because the small canoe is swamped, The large canoe will meet the same fate. Troubles will overtake the king, troubles will overtake the priest, Troubles will overtake the unstable ones, the followers of the king. The different officers of the king, They will search out, they will study out, To locate the stars in the heaven. The red star, the string of stars; They hasten singly, They hasten by twos. Say, Keawenuiaumi, come ashore. Yesterday was the calm day; Had you come yesterday, you would have reached your destination. This is a stormy day."

He then ordered his men to paddle on. When Kuapakaa heard the order he said to Pakaa his father: “The king is sailing off.” Pakaa replied: “Call for the winds of Kauai and Niihau.”"

"Oia na makani o Kauai, a ke keiki i kahea ai, a pela no a hiki i keia la.","These were the names of the winds of Kauai, as called out by the boy, and they are known by these names to this day."
"A hooki o Kuapakaa i ke kahea ana i na makani, ua lohe ia ka halulu, me he nu makani la i na waa o Keawenuiaumi.

At the roar of the coming storm, Pakaa said to the boy: “You made a mistake in first calling for the winds of Kauai and Niihau. You see you had called for the winds of Hawaii, those in the east; you should have followed with the wind of Kaula, the wind in the west.” Kuapakaa then called for the wind of Kaula: [ ]"
"NA MAKANI O KAULA. A lalo i ka pohaku a Ola, Ka manu eele koi, E koi mai mai ana ka manu o Kaula, Ke kau nei la i luna o Waahila, Ka manu o Kaulanaula, He pokii moku na Hina i hanau, He ekeeke ka makani o Kaula; Homai, homai, homai he makani.","THE WIND OF KAULA. Down by the rock of Ola, The black bird begged, The bird of Kaula begged, Floating up there above Waahila, The bird of Kaulanaula, The younger isle, given birth by Hina. The ekeeke is the wind of Kaula; Give me, give me, give me the wind."
"Ma keia kahea ana a Kuapakaa i ko Kaula makani, olelo mai o Keawenuiaumi: “Maikai hoi ka olelo a ke keiki, a ko kahea ana i ka makani, hewa oe.”","In this call of Kuapakaa for the wind of Kaula, Keawenuiaumi, said: “You have indeed chanted well, boy; but in thus calling for the wind, you committed a grave mistake.”"
"Ia wa, kena aku la o Keawenuiaumi i na hoewaa a me na hookele, e hoe; alaila, hoe iho la ka poe e noho ana mai hope o na waa a waena.

The people from the rear to those in the middle of the canoe, then dipped down their paddles; but those in front, did not dip theirs for Lapakahoe refused to continue the voyage as he was greatly interested with the boy’s chant. When the men in the stern and in the middle started to paddle, Lapakahoe called out to those in front: “Kuia, Lou, Kipukohola, backwater with the paddles, to hold back the canoe so as not to allow it to go ahead.” By doing this the sound of the moving pebbles and the sand down below was heard and the double canoe was held back as though held by an anchor."
"A ike o Kuapakaa i ka paa o na waa, a me ke ano huhu loa o Keawenuiaumi ia ia, olelo aku la ia ia Pakaa, a lohe o Pakaa, olelo mai la i ke keiki: “Kahea ia.” (He paha ke ano o ia.) Alaila, kahea o Kuapakaa:","When Kuapakaa saw that the double canoe was being held back and saw also the anger shown in the face of Keawenuiaumi, he turned and reported it to Pakaa. When Pakaa heard this, he said to the boy: “Call again.” (This was in the style of a chant.) Kuapakaa therefore called forth:"
"Kiauau! Kiauau! Kiauau! E au mai, e au aku, E lei ka moana. Kalaihi ka lani, Kupilikii ka honua, Kalo-pau ka malama, Ku ana lepe, noho ana lepe, Kau ka iwa he la makani, Ua ka ua, kahe ka wai.

Gently! Gently! Hasten this way, hasten that way, The ocean is like a wreath around your neck. The heaven is cloudless, The earth is in distress, The month is Kalo-pau. Up comes lepe , down sits lepe. The iwa bird is in the sky, it is a windy day. The rain falls, the water runs. The shrimps are coming up, the sea-caves are exposed. Where the sea is foamy, there the moi dwell; Where the sea is rough, the mullet spawn. When the sea is at low tide, the squids are speared, The ina are gathered, the wana are hooked up. The turtles come up to breathe on a windy day. Where the sea is not clear, there the manini live; Where the shoals are rocky, the uoa turn over; [ ] Where the sea is blue, the sharks dwell; Where the feeding ground is deep, the kahala grows thin; Where the kukui-nut is spat on, the sea is smooth, The uhu are caught; Caught by those in front, by Mumu, by Wawa. As it falls down, the rain leaves holes, The wind doubles over, The beach at Kaunakahakai is marshy, The scent of Kawela is strong, The sound is deafening, As you paddle to destruction at the point of Lehua, Ualapue, Kaluaaha, Molokai."
"A pau keia kiauau ana a ke keiki, olelo mai o Pakaa, kahea ia ko Maui makani me ko Molokai.","After the boy had chanted this, Pakaa said to him: “Call for the winds of Maui and Molokai.”"
"Olelo hoakaka. O Halawa ka aina i oi aku ka makani ma keia kaao ana, nolaila, he pono i ka mea e heluhelu ana e noonoo, a e hoomaopopo. [ ]","A word of explanation. Halawa is the place which excels in the variety of winds given here, therefore the reader will do well to consider them clearly. [ ]"
"Ma keia heluhelu ana, e pono e nana hou mahope i maopopo na makani o Molokai, a ka helu ana i na makani o Halawa hele mai, nolaila e pili ai keia kakau ana.","In following this list of names of the different winds of Molokai, we again take up the winds for the rest of Molokai, after the winds of Halawa."

When the sun is set, it becomes intensely cold, The sea is drawn up, it becomes as low tide, For the burden of the moae wind is the storm. The moae stays there above, It is heard clear down beyond, As it blows here and there on the coral reef, Like the strong wind in the forest, And the landing at Keawa is made rough. Here is the landing, land now, Whilst thou art near, master; Whilst I am near, the servant, And await the calm day, For this is Welehu, the stormy month; Then come Makali, Kaelo, Kaulua, Kaulua, Kauluawaena. In Olana is the settled calm, Then come Welo and Ikiiki, In which when you look the sea appears long, The isles seem near, and the canoe can land. Seek for Pakaa and find Pakaa. For Waimea is a land of crabs. The rains of Molokai are heavy. [ ]"
"Ma keia mau lalani hope loa, i olelo mai ai o Lapakahoe: “He hoopunipuni ke keiki.” I mai o Lapakahoe ia Kuapakaa: “Maikai ko hana e ke keiki, a o ko hoopunipuni ana mai nei, aole o Pakaa i uka, a ke olelo mai nei oe e pae.” Mahope o keia olelo ana a Lapakahoe, kena aku la ia mai mua a hope o na waa, e hoe, pela i na hookele, a makaukau lakou la e holo, i aku o Kuapakaa ia Pakaa: “Holo kuu haku.” Olelo mai o Pakaa: “Kahea ia ka paha o ko haku.”","While chanting the last lines, Lapakahoe said: “The boy is deceiving us.” Lapakahoe then turned to Kuapakaa and said: “Your chant was indeed good, but you are deceiving us, for Pakaa is not ashore, yet you ask us to land.” After making this remark, Lapakahoe ordered the men in front and behind to paddle away. The order was also given the sailing masters. When they were starting off, Kuapakaa said to his father: “My master is off.” Pakaa replied: “Chant the name of your master.”"

The burden of the hands is the paddle, The opponent of the wave is the paddle, You make your deposit, the blue, You take up your share, the white. You turn up the white foam with the paddle, Within and without the canoe. The going forth of the canoe is in jerks, It is agitated, it shakes.

When the double canoe was away off, so that it appeared but a mere speck, Pakaa said to the boy: “Uncover the wind calabash, Laamaomao.” Kuapakaa then uncovered the wind calabash and the storm in all its fury came up. The front canoes were caught by the waves and wind from the Kalaau point; being those that contained the chiefs and the men. When the large canoes saw that the small canoes were swamped, the large ones went to their rescue, but they too were swamped. The waves became larger and larger and they beat from all sides. The wind and the storm swept along until the canoe of Keawenuiaumi was met and it too was swamped. Keawenuiaumi then said to the priest, the prophet and the sailing masters: “How strange this is! The boy’s every word has [ ] come true. When the boy said this was a stormy day, you all contradicted him, saying this was a pleasant day; but here we are nigh unto death. I questioned you several times about the matter, to make sure that you were right; but you all denied it.”"

The people suffered a terrible cold and many of their things were lost; the food, the fish and meat, their apparel and everything else. At this, the king wept in his agony and suffered severely from cold, he then said: “This is the very reason why I am in search of my servant Pakaa, because you are not equal to the occasion; you are without knowledge and do not know how to tell the future. My buttocks were never wet when Pakaa was my sailing master; but since I have taken you, they have become wet.”"
"Ike aku la o Pakaa i ka makani, a me ka ino launa ole, i aku la ia i ke keiki: “Poia iho ke poi o ka ipu, o make auanei ko haku, eia la ua anuanu.” Popoi iho la o Kuapakaa i ke poi o Laamaomao, a hikiwawe iho la ka malie ana, a pakele ae la na waa o ke ’lii.","When Pakaa saw that the wind and the storm was in its fury, he said to the boy: “Cover up the wind calabash, for your master may perish, as he is indeed cold.” Kuapakaa then placed the cover on the calabash, Laamaomao, and the calm came immediately and the canoes of the king were saved."
"Ma keia pakele ana o ke ’lii, olelo aku la ia i na waa a pau: “E hoi kakou, malama ke lana ala no ka waa o ke keiki, i olelo mai ia kakou e pae, ae aku kakou e pae, alaila pae kakou.”","After the canoes had been righted, the king gave his orders to all the canoes, saying: “Let us return, perchance the boy’s canoe is still floating where we left it. Should he invite us to land we must obey.”"
"Pau ka olelo ana a ke ’lii, hoe kela waa keia waa, aia ka pono o ka hiki i kahi o Kuapakaa e lana ana.

In this return, the canoe of Keawenuiaumi being the swiftest, was the first to arrive at the place where Kuapakaa was waiting, while the others were strung out behind."
"Ike aku la o Kuapakaa i ko ke ’lii waa, olelo aku la ia ia Pakaa: “Eia na waa o kuu haku o Keawenuiaumi.” I aku o Pakaa i ke keiki: “I hiki mai ko haku, a ae i ka pae i anei, alaila, e olelo aku oe, o kaua mua a kahi a kaua e hoolana ai, alaila, kahea mai.

Ma ia mea noonoo o Pakaa i mea e hiki ai laua mamua, a ike ole ia kona ano, i nalowale, nolaila, kona kuhikuhi lalau ana, o loaa ia. Alaila, paha hou o Kuapakaa, penei:","When Kuapakaa saw the king’s canoe, he said to Pakaa: “Here comes the double canoe of my master, Keawenuiaumi.” Pakaa said to the boy: “When your master arrives and should show a willingness to land, say to him that you wish to go in ahead a little ways and wait for him, for the passage way is crooked.” By this Pakaa was anxious to keep the canoe of Keawenuiaumi behind them, for his men being stronger, they would be able to get to the landing first and in that way Pakaa would be recognized, so Pakaa thought out a way to get out of the difficulty, and made believe that the way in was crooked. As the canoe of Keawenuiaumi was drawing near, Kuapakaa again chanted, saying:"
"Kiauau! Kiauau! Makani ka ua, po ka moku, Nihinihi ka haku, [ ] Kaa ka ua, kaa ka waa, Ehuehu kai lele ka moi, Hee loko ua ai ka ale, Lele na ukana, Hoaa i ke aloha o ke keiki, Uwe i ke aloha o ka wahine, Noho inoino kulanalana, Hae ka ilio i ke kai, Nanahu i ka nuku o ka waa, Hookoo ka pili mua, Hele ka pili hope, Kai ka pili a ke kahuna, Kuouou, haalulu, Pahili, haukeke, Huhuluwi na hulu i ka maha, E na holo moana hookuli, Akahi la anuanu e ke ’lii. E Keawenuiaumi, e pae.","Gently! Gently! Comes the wind, the rain; the isle is in darkness, The master is on the edge of disaster. [ ] The rain drove, the canoe rolled, The sea is raging, the moi leap. The inwards are retreating, the waves are being fed, The burden is cast away. They look about in doubt for love of the children, They weep for the love of the wife. The seat is unsafe, insecure. The dog barks at the sea, It bites at the prow of the canoe. The old companion is become strained, The new companion is become separated, The comradeship of the priest is also parted, He goes alone, he shudders, He twists, he shivers, The hairs on the temple are wet, Ye stubborn sailors of the ocean, ’Tis the first cold day for the king. Say, Keawenuiaumi, come ashore."
"I mai o Keawenuiaumi: “Ae, e pae, he mea no kau a hala ko olelo i i mai ai; ua ae no au e pae, o ke akamai hoi o lakou nei, kai no he ike io, aole ka!” I aku o Kuapakaa: “Ike la i ka make, e pae i ke awa o ke keiki.” Ae mai ke ’lii: “Ae, e pae.” “Auhea oe e ke ’lii, e hoolohe mai oe; o maua ke holo e, a kahi e ani mai ai na lima, alaila, oukou holo ae, no ka mea, he kekee ke awa e pae aku ai o uka, ua hala no hoi ka wa pono e pae ai.

I keia wa, ua nalowale na pukoakoa no ka hohonu o ke kai, nolaila, hu hewa kakou ke holo pu.” Ma keia olelo a Kuapakaa, ae mai o Keawenuiaumi: “Ae, ua pono ia.”","Keawenuiaumi made reply: “Yes, I will come ashore for your very words have come true. I was willing to land, but these fellows were so learned. I thought they were indeed learned, but I have found that they are not.” Kuapakaa said: “There, you have faced disaster. Come ashore at the boy’s landing.” The king then expressed his willingness to land. Kuapakaa then said to the king: “Say, listen to me; we will go in first and when I beckon to you, you may come, because the passage way is crooked, and furthermore the proper time for making a landing is past. Had you consented to make land at my first invitation, we would have had no trouble; for at that time the tide was low and the coral exposed; but now the tide is high, so that the coral is covered deep, and we will miss our bearings if we go in together.” To this, Keawenuiaumi gave his consent, saying: “That is well.”"
"Holo mua aku la o Pakaa ma mamua, a kahi e lana ai, alaila kahea mai i ko ke ’lii mau waa, a me na waa e ae. Pela no ka holo ana, i o ianei, e hookekee ai, a kokoke loa e pae i uka olelo aku o Pakaa i ke keiki: “E, e hoe kaua, e hoe oe a ikaika loa, i pae kaua.” Ia laua i hoe ai, pae e aku la ko laua waa i uka, lehei aku la o Pakaa mai ka waa aku a holokiki aku la a komo i ka hale aipuupuu, oia ka hale a Pakaa i manao ai e nalo, no ka mea, he hale komo ole ia e ke ’lii.

This zigzag was continued until they were almost in, when Pakaa said to the boy: “Say, let us paddle in; you must exert all your strength, that we may land before the others.” With this the two worked with all their might and made land before the others. Pakaa then jumped ashore and ran into the house reserved for the preparation of food, thinking that in this house he would be safe, for such houses were never entered by kings. When Pakaa jumped from the canoe, Lapakahoe saw and thought he recognized Pakaa by the limp he made while running, for his legs had been injured; but he was not certain, believing that Pakaa was in Kaula."
"Ahiahi iho la, pau loa mai la na waa i ka pae, a me ko Keawenuiaumi, eia nae, o Keawenuiaumi, i luna no ia o ka pola o na waa kahi i kau ai, aole i lele i uka, no ka mea, aohe kapa, aohe malo, ua pau loa i ka pulu, a ua pau loa i ka lilo i ke kai.

When Kuapakaa saw his master sitting there naked on the canoe, he returned to the house and told his father of what he had seen. When Pakaa heard this, he took out a loin cloth and gave it to Kuapakaa, saying to the boy: “You take [ ] this loin cloth and give it to your master, and the loin cloth that is wet, you bring it here, for you are privileged to wear his loin cloth and he yours.”"
"Lawe aku la o Kuapakaa i ka malo a hiki i mua o Keawenuiaumi: “Eia kuu wahi malo nou, o ko malo pulu e haawi mai oe ia’u.” Lalau mai la o Keawenuiaumi i ka malo a nana iho la, ua like loa me kona malo i ko laua wa e noho ana me Pakaa; i mai la o Keawenuiaumi: “E, ua like loa no keia malo me ko’u malo.” I aku o Kuapakaa: “No’u no keia malo; o oe hoi na e ke ’lii, nolaila, haawi aku la au nou ia.” Hoi mai la o Kuapakaa me ka malo pulu a mua o Pakaa, i mai la o Pakaa: “Kau ia ae ka malo o ko haku ma ka puka o ka hale, i ole e komo mai na kanaka i loko nei. O oe ka mea komo i keia hale, a me ka puka i waho, no ka mea, ua laa oe i ke kapa a me ka malo o ko haku, i hele mai na aipuupuu i ai, nau e haawi aku maloko nei, ma waho mai no lakou.” He hana maalea keia a Pakaa.","Kuapakaa therefore took up the loin cloth and returned to Keawenuiaumi. When he came to the king’s presence he said: “Here is my loin cloth, you can use it and let me take your wet one.” Keawenuiaumi reached out for the loin cloth and looked at it, and saw that it looked like his own, the kind he used to wear when Pakaa had charge. At seeing this, Keawenuiaumi said: “Say, this loin cloth looks just like my own.” Kuapakaa replied: “This is my own loin cloth, but you being the king, I give it to you.” Kuapakaa then took the wet one and returned to Pakaa, who said to him: “Hang up your master’s loin cloth over the door way, so that the people will not try to enter this house. You can enter it and can go out, because all the sacred things belonging to your master are free to you. When the king’s stewards come for food you can hand it to them from the inside of this house, while they stand outside.” This was cunning of Pakaa."
"Nana aku la o Kuapakaa, o ka noho wale mai o Keawenuiaumi aohe kapa, aloha iho la ia, olelo aku la ia Pakaa; a lohe o Pakaa, unuhi mai la ia i ke kapa, i loko o ka ipu o Laamaomao, a haawi aku la ia Kuapakaa. Olelo aku la: “E lawe oe i ke kapa a haawi aku i ko haku, i olelo mai ko haku, ua like me kona kapa, e olelo aku oe, o kou kapa no keia a kou makuahine i kuku ai nou.” O ka inoa o ke kapa, o ouholowai o Laa; ua aala loa, no ka mea, ua hooluuia i na nahelehele aala o Laa a me Puna, oia ka olapa, ke kupaoa, ka mokihana, ke apiipii, a me na mea e ae.","When Kuapakaa looked and saw that Keawenuiaumi was sitting without any covering, he took pity on him and so told Pakaa about it. When Pakaa heard this he took out a kapa from the wind calabash, Laamaomao and handed it to Kuapakaa, saying: “You take this and give it to your master. If he should say that it looks like his, you tell him, that this is your own kapa made by your mother.” The name given to such kapas was “ouholowai of Laa.” They were very sweet, having been scented with the fragrant shrubs and vines of Laa and Puna, called the olapa , the kupaoa , the mokihana , the apiipii and others."
"A hiki aku la o Kuapakaa i mua o Keawenuiaumi me ke kapa, haawi aku la, lalau mai la o Keawenuiaumi i ke kapa, a kuehuehu ae la, po i ke ala o ka olapa, honi iho la i ke ala. Alaila, ninau mai la i ke keiki: “Nohea keia kapa i loaa ai ia oe?” “No Molokai nei no,” pela aku ke keiki. I mai o Keawenuiaumi: “Aohe kapa o na wahi e ae e like me ko Hawaii, aole no hoi i laha i na ’lii e ae, ia’u wale no; me he mea ala o kuu kapa no keia, a eia no paha i anei o Pakaa?” “Na ko’u makuahine no i kuku i keia kapa no’u, no ka mea, he ’lii ko’u makuahine no Molokai, a he kapa aala no hoi ko keia aina, ua hooluu ia i na mea aala he nui loa, a ua malama ia no’u. O ka inoa o ko’u kapa, o wailau, oia koonei kapa aala loa, e like me ko oukou he ouholowai o Laa. Ua like na aala.” Pau ae la ko ke ’lii manao haohao.","When Kuapakaa came to the presence of the king with the kapa and handed it to Keawenuiaumi, Keawenuiaumi took it and spread it out. As he did this he caught the sweet scent of the olapa. He then inquired of the boy: “Where did you get this kapa?” The boy replied: “It belongs here in Molokai.” Keawenuiaumi said: “There are no kapas in other places like those of Hawaii; and they are not common with other chiefs. I am the only one who possesses such things. I believe this is my kapa. It must be that Pakaa is here.” “It was my mother that made this kapa for my own use, for my mother is a chiefess of Molokai and kapas are scented on this island, and it has been kept for my own use. The name given my kapa is wailau. That is the best and most fragrant kapa in this place, like what you call the ouholowai of Laa; they smell the same.” This satisfied the king."
"A ahiahi iho la, akoakoa ae la na ’lii me ko lakou mau kanaka, a kahi hookahi; olelo aku o Keawenuiaumi: “Ina nei la o Pakaa, penei keia ahiahi la, o ka apu awa mai la no, o na hinalea ola elua. Inu iho la a ona, ooki iho la ka ona o ka awa, uwi kela me he koko aha la, a ao ka po; aloha no hoi o Pakaa.”","That evening the chiefs came together with their men and as they were sitting quite close to the king, the king said: “If Pakaa was here, of an evening like this, he would have my awa ready with two fresh hinalea . I would drink the awa and as its effects come over me, I would feel like a newly made net, nice and snug, all night. How I do miss Pakaa.”"
"Lohe o Kuapakaa i keia olelo a ke ’lii, hoi aku la ia olelo ia Pakaa: “Ua ono kuu [ ] haku i ka awa, a olelo mai nei he aloha ia oe no ia mau mea i kou wa e noho ana me ia.” A lohe o Pakaa, unuhi mai la ia i ka apu, i ke kanoa, i ka mauu, i ka puawa, me na mana awa elua i mama mua ia: “Lawe oe i keia a ko haku, hoike aku, a i olelo mai nau e mama, ae aku no. Alaila, huli ae oe a ma kahi poeleele, waiho oe i ka puawa okoa, lalau iho oe i na mana i wali, a hoka iho i loko o ke kanoa, alaila, e mahalo kela i ko hikiwawe, no ke mea, pela wau i ko’u wa e noho ana me ia.

If he should ask you to prepare the awa for him, give your consent. Then you turn to one side where it is dark, leave the piece that is not prepared, take up the portions that are ready, strain them into the cup. He will compliment you for being very quick, for I was ever ready with these things when I was with him. After you have strained the awa into the cup, hand the cup to your master, then run as fast as you can to the pool where we keep the hinalea and catch two for your master, for he would want the fish to take away the bitter taste of the awa from his mouth.”"
"A hiki o Kuapakaa i mua o Keawenuiaumi, olelo aku la: “Eia kuu wahi awa nou.” Nana mai la ke ’lii a ike he puawa nui, olelo mai la: “Nau no e mama.” Huli ae la o Kuapakaa ma kahi poeleele a hoka iho la i na mana i wali mua, haawi aku la i ke ’lii, a holo aku la i na hinalea elua, a hoi mai la i mua o Keawenuiaumi.","When Kuapakaa came to the presence of Keawenuiaumi, he said: “Here is my awa for you.” The king looked and saw that it was quite a large piece, so he said: “You had better prepare it for me.” Kuapakaa then turned into a dark corner, took the portions already prepared, strained the same and handed the cup to the king. The boy then ran for the fish, the two hinalea, and shortly after he returned with them to the king."
"No keia mau hana a ke keiki, mahalo iho la o Keawenuiaumi i ka eleu, me he kanaka makua ala, ua noho me na ’lii a maa ka makaukau. Inu iho la ke ’lii a ona, moe iho la, hui ae la ka ona o ka awa me ka maluhiluhi o ke kai, o ka moe ka hana.","Because of these things performed by the boy, Keawenuiaumi complimented him for being quick and for carrying himself like a person who has always lived with kings, and for conducting himself so well. The king then drank up the awa and as the effects of it stole over him, combined with the weariness of a hard and eventful day, he fell into a deep sleep."
"Nolaila, manao o Kuapakaa, e huai i ka ipu makani ana ia Laamaomao, i pa ka makani, mau no ka ino, noho no ke ’lii me ia. Wehe ae la o Kuapakaa i ke poi o Laamaomao, a pa iho la ka ino i kela la i keia la, ma keia ino i lohi ai ka holo o Keawenuiaumi.

Hoouna aku la o Keawenuiaumi i ke kanaka, e ninau aku i ke keiki he ai paha kana, aole paha. Aka, ina he ai, e olelo aku oe he pilikia ko kakou.","Upon seeing this, Kuapakaa decided to uncover the wind calabash, Laamaomao, and to keep it uncovered, so that the winds would continue to blow and the storm hold for days; and in this way keep the king with him. So Kuapakaa uncovered Laamaomao, and the storm kept up day after day; and by it the expedition for the search was postponed. Because of this storm Keawenuiaumi and his men were forced to wait for the abating of the storm until one month went by, when their food which had been brought from Hawaii was exhausted. At this, the chiefs went before Keawenuiaumi and told him of their trouble, that they had run out of food. When Keawenuiaumi heard this he sent a man to go and ask of the boy, if he had any food. Said the king: “If he has any food, tell him that we are without any.”"
"A hiki aku la ke kanaka i mua o Kuapakaa, hai aku la i na olelo a Keawenuiaumi, a lohe o Kuapakaa, olelo mai la: “He ai no, eia nae, e hoi oe a hai aku i ke ’lii ia Keawenuiaumi, he ai no, aia i uka, e olelo aku oe, eono alii, eono kipoipoi.

When Kuapakaa heard this, he said: “There is food; but you must go back to the king and tell him the food is up in the uplands. Tell him there are six chiefs here and I have six small patches. Furthermore, if you should go for food, don’t take the big potatoes only and leave the small ones; for if you do so you will not get another chance to go up there for food.” With this the messenger returned to the presence of Keawenuiaumi and reported to him of what the boy had said. When Keawenuiaumi heard this he ordered his men and the chiefs to go up for food."
"A hiki lakou i uka, nana aku la lakou i na mala uala eono, nui launa ole, a loihi no hoi ke nana aku. Olelo ae la kekahi i kekahi: “Kupanaha, olelo mai nei hoi ua [ ] keiki nei, he mau wahi kipoipoi wale no, eia ka hoi, he mau mala nunui.” Koki iho la lakou, a nui ka ai, hoiliili iho la, e like me ka olelo a ke keiki mai ka mea nui a ka mea liilii, a hoi aku la a hiki i kai, hoa ka umu, a moa ae la, ai iho la lakou.

Penei nae oukou e hana ai; e ihi oukou a pau ka ili o waho, alaila, kaulai i ka la a maloo.” O ke ano o keia, he ao maloo.","When they came to the uplands, where the potatoes were growing they saw that there were six large patches, each of very great extent, and were so long that the other ends could not be seen. The men then said to themselves: “How wonderful! The [ ] boy said there were six small patches, but here there are six very large patches.” The men then began to dig up the potatoes, and after they had dug up enough, they collected the potatoes and in obedience to the boy’s order, they took the large ones as well as the small ones and returned with the potatoes to the beach, lighted the ovens, and after the potatoes were cooked, they sat down and ate their fill."
"Ninau mai la lakou: “Heaha ke ano o keia hana au e ke keiki?” I aku o Kuapakaa: “No ko’u manao, e pau ana kela mau mala uala ia oukou, a e hiki mai ana ka manawa ino o keia aina, e kaikoo ai ka moana o kai, a e loihi ana no hoi ko oukou noho ana i anei, no ka mea, ekolu malama ino i koe, o Makalii, Kaelo, Kaulua.

But I want you to do this: peel the skin and then set out the potatoes to dry.” The people then asked Kuapakaa: “What do you intend doing with the food, boy?” Kuapakaa replied: “I am doing this, because I know you will eat up those potato patches and the bad weather of this land generally comes about this time, when the sea will be rough, which will keep you here for some time, for there are three bad months yet to come; Makalii, Kaelo and Kaulua. In the month of Olana, it is possible that fine weather will come, then you people will be able to get away. By that time my potatoes will all be consumed by you, but by doing this, saving and drying out the small potatoes, I will not be without food and will not be hungry, for I shall then live on the small potatoes which I ask you to keep for me. With this food I will be supplied during the time of planting and care of a new crop.” This talk by Kuapakaa, although true, was intended to deceive them, for Kuapakaa well knew that Keawenuiaumi was going to urge that he go along with him in the search for Pakaa, when good weather once more prevailed. The men, in obedience to this order, faithfully kept all the small potatoes after every cooking day."
"Eia nae, ia Keawenuiaumi ma i holo mai ai mai Hawaii mai, olelo aku ia i na ’lii o hope a me na makaainana, hookahi mahina e holo mai ai e imi ia Pakaa, aka, ua hala na mahina eha ia lakou ma Molokai, o ka noho ana.

He was, however, mistaken in this, for he was in Molokai for four months. In this prolonged absence the people of Hawaii began to mourn for their king, believing that he was dead. After staying in Molokai for four months, the followers of Keawenuiaumi began to think of their wives, children and parents, and there was a general feeling amongst them that they abandon the search for Pakaa and return to Hawaii."
"A pau na malama ino eha a Kuapakaa i olelo ai, popoi iho la ia i ka ipu makani o Laamaomao, hookau mai la ka malie.

He then said to the people: “This is Olana, the pleasant month, then come Welo and Ikiikii (May and June), the period of time when the fisherman’s fish line is always wet. These months are the pleasant months, and hence the fisherman’s line is never dry, because they go out fishing every day.” He then said to the chiefs and men: “Bind the lashings of the canoes, for I have kept you for four months because of the bad weather; now that good weather has come, you must return home.” When the chiefs heard this, they made ready their canoes, renewed the lashings, and pushed the canoes out into the sea and moored them, for the expedition [ ] of kings is ever alert. Very late that evening, when it was almost midnight, Kuapakaa called out in a chant, as follows:"
"E ala! e ala! e ala! Ua kulu ka po! ua kulu ka po! Pau ka luhi, ka eha, ka opa, Ka maka pouli o na waa la. E ala! e ala! e ala! Aia i luna o Hikiliimakaounulau, Ka hoku i ka palena o ka aina.

Arise! Arise! Hikiliimakaounulau is up, The star at the end of the land. Arise, make a move! Arise, make a move!"
"Ma keia olelo a ke keiki, olelo ae la na ’lii: “Kupanaha! Aole hoi i kokoke aku i ke ao, o ka hea okoa mai nei no ia e holo, eia no ka i ke ahiahi okoa.”","Upon hearing this, the chiefs said: “How strange! it is not yet anywheres near daylight, but the boy is calling us to sail off. This is only in the early evening.”"
"O ko na ’lii manao ma keia olelo a ke keiki, e waiho a huli ka ia i ke kau o ka po, alaila holo. Nolaila, hoomaka hou o Kuapakaa e kahea ma ka inoa o na moku eono o Hawaii, e pili ana i na ’lii eono o Hawaii:","By this expression used by the chiefs, it was their intention to delay their sailing until the change of the Milky Way, after midnight, when they would make the start. Hearing this expression, Kuapakaa again called out; this time naming the six different districts of Hawaii, and also the six chiefs."

In waiting for the king, the chiefs allowed their canoes to drift away; and in drifting they all fell asleep. The men who were anxious to get back home then headed the canoes for Kawaihae in Kohala, Hawaii; at daylight the next day, the chiefs awoke and when they looked about them they saw that the land in sight was Hawaii. Instead of getting angry, they felt happy, for they knew that they were about to see their wives and children; they, however, felt some regrets, for they loved their king, Keawenuiaumi."
"A ao ae la kii aku la ke kanaka ia Kuapakaa, ma ke kauoha a ke ’lii e hele mai i mua ona. A hiki o Kuapakaa i mua o Keawenuiaumi, olelo mai la: “I kii aku nei au ia oe, e holo pu kaua i Kaula a hoi mai.” Olelo aku o Kuapakaa: “Aole au e hiki, e haalele iho auanei au i kuu wahi pupu elemakule, no ka mea, ua palupalu.” A no ke koi pinepine a ke ’lii, ae aku la o Kuapakaa e holo pu, o kona manao no ia o ka holo pu me Keawenuiaumi.

When Kuapakaa came before Keawenuiaumi the king said: “I have sent for you to ask you that you accompany me to Kaula and back.” Kuapakaa replied: “I cannot go with you, for I would be leaving my old man by himself and he is very weak.” But since the king kept on urging him, Kuapakaa agreed to accompany the king. This by the way was the wish of Kuapakaa. In giving his consent, Kuapakaa made his going conditional, saying: “I am willing to go with you, if you will take my things along. If you allow this, I will accompany you; but if you will not allow my things to go along, I will not go with with you.” The king gave his consent, saying: “I am willing that you go with your things.” Keawenuiaumi then told the men to take the things belonging to the boy and place them on the canoe, believing that this would allow the boy to accompany him."
"A hiki na kanaka i kahi o ka ukana, i nana iho ka hana, he laau nui, ua like ka loa me na waa o ke ’lii, o Keawenuiaumi. Olelo iho la na kanaka, ina paha e kau keia laau nui i luna o na waa, o ke komo no ia, no ka nui launa ole.

[ ]","When the men came to the place where the boy’s things were, they looked and saw a large log of wood as long as the double canoe of the king. When the men saw this log they expressed their doubts as to its being able to be carried by the double canoe for they feared that it would be too much of a load. The men, however, took it up with some difficulty and placed it on the canoe, which set the canoe deep in the water. The boy then pointed to another thing, a rock, with a groove cut around it; thus making two things the boy wished placed in the canoe. [ ]"
"O keia laau nui, he ukana o loko, he ai, he ia a me na mea a pau loa. No keia laau nui, kapa na kanaka ia ia: “O ke keiki opeope nui o Kaluakoi.” A pau na ukana a ke keiki i luna o ka waa, ee aku la o Keawenuiaumi me Kuapakaa, a me na mea a pau loa i luna o ka waa, a holo aku la.","This large log of wood was hollow and contained food and various other things. Because of this large log, the men gave the boy the name, “The boy of Kaluakoi with the large package.” After the things belonging to the boy had been placed on the double canoe, Keawenuiaumi and Kuapakaa, as well as the rest of the men, boarded it and set sail."
"Ma keia holo ana, he maikai ka makani, he kaao; ia wa nana aku la o Kuapakaa i na hookele, a nonoi aku la i kekahi hoe ia ia, hoole mai la na hookele: “Aohe maua e haawi aku ia oe, no ka mea, o ko maua haawina no ia; hewa maua ke lilo ia oe.” Ma keia hana a Kuapakaa he imihala i na hookele, no ka mea, o na hookele ko Pakaa mea i hele ai mai a Keawenuiaumi mai.","In setting out, they experienced pleasant winds, called Kaao; Kuapakaa at once looked at the two sailing masters and asked that they give him one of the paddles, but they refused, saying: “We cannot give you one because this is our sign of authority. We will be blamed if we surrender it to you.” By this Kuapakaa wanted to place the responsibility upon their own heads, in case of coming disaster, for these were the very men who had made things so unpleasant for his father, Pakaa, who was forced to go away from the presence of Keawenuiaumi."
"Holo mai la lakou mai Molokai a kalewa mawaho o Oahu nei, malaila aku a ke kai o Kaieiewaho, ike lakou ia Kauai, a mahope, holo ana lakou mawaho o Waimea.

Ia wa, hiki mai ka ino a nui loa, aole o kana mai ka ua me ka makani, ka hekili me ka uwila, a aneane e nalowale o Kauai.","The canoe sailed on and passed to the lee of Oahu, then on into the sea of Kaieiewaho, where they saw Kauai; after a time they went past Waimea. At this place Kuapakaa uncovered his wind calabash, Laamaomao and immediately they were encompassed by a terrible storm. In meeting this storm the king did not worry for he had the boy with him. When they were beset with this storm, Keawenuiaumi asked of the sailing masters: “What are we to do?” The two were unable to make answer, at that time, for the waves were beating into the canoe, and it was only being kept afloat through the exertion of the bailers. Soon after this the storm increased and the wind and rain were terrible; the thunder and lightning too was severe, and they began to drift away until Kauai was almost lost to their sight."
"Ma keia ino i loohia ai ia lakou, ninau aku la o Keawenuiaumi i ke keiki: “Pehea ka ino?” I aku o Kuapakaa: “Aohe a’u pono e ae, eia wale no, e hoolei ka pohaku nei la i ke kai i heleuma no na waa e paa ai, e aho ia, aole kakou e puhi ia e ka makani, a nalowale ka aina.” Ia wa, hooili mai la o Keawenuiaumi i na hana a pau loa ia Kuapakaa, ia ia ka make, a me ke ola; alaila, unuhi ae la o Kuapakaa i ke poo o ka laau a lawe ae la i ke kaula a nakii iho la i ka pohaku, a hoolei aku la i loko o ke kai, a paa iho la lakou i kahi hookahi.","As the storm increased, Keawenuiaumi turned to the boy and asked: “What about this storm?” Kuapakaa answered: “I have nothing else to meet it, except this rock; it must be cast out to serve as an anchor to hold the canoe and in that way prevent our being blown away by the wind and lose sight of land.” At this, Keawenuiaumi surrendered the entire command of the canoe to Kuapakaa; it was his to carry them to destruction or to safety. Kuapakaa then opened out one end of the log, and taking out a rope he fastened it to the rock, and threw it into the sea, and they were held in one place."
"A ike o Kuapakaa i ke anu o na kanaka a me ke ’lii, ua huluhulu loloa, ua haukeke, alaila, unuhi ae la ia i ka lau o ka loulu mai loko ae o ka laau, a haawi pakahi aku la i na kanaka, a me ke ’lii, o Keawenuiaumi, i ka ao loulu, a koe na hookele, oia o Hookeleihilo a me Hookeleipuna, aohe o laua ao loulu . Mahope o keia, haawi aku la o Kuapakaa i ka ai a me ka ia i na kanaka, a koe o Hookeleihilo a me Hookeleipuna, aohe ai a laua.","When Kuapakaa saw that the men and the king were shivering from the intense cold, that their hair hung down straight and every one was suffering, he took out some palm leaves from the log and gave the men one apiece and one to the king; but he did not give the sailing masters, Hookeleihilo and Hookeleipuna, any. Soon after this he took out food and meat from the log, and gave some to the men and to the king; but he again refused to give anything to the sailing masters."
"Ma keia hana ana a Kuapakaa, ua pilikia loa na hookele i ke anu a me ka pololi, aole i liuliu iho, pahu ana o Hookeleihilo i loko o ke kai mahope o na waa. Kahea mai la ke kanaka mamua iho o Hookeleihilo: “E! Pahu aku la o Hookeleihilo i loko o ke kai!” Aole i liuliu iho, make o Hookeleipuna, pau loa na hookele i ka make. [ ]","By this action of Kuapakaa the two sailing masters were in great distress, for they were shivering with the cold and were in great need of food. Not very long after this, Hookeleihilo fell overboard, unable to withstand any longer the terrible sufferings. At this the man who sat in front of Hookeleiho called out: “Hookeleihilo has fallen overboard.” Not very long after this, Hookeleipuna succumbed and he too fell overboard, dead; thus were the two sailing masters disposed of. [ ]"
"A ike o Kuapakaa, ua make na enemi o kona makuakane o Pakaa, alaila, popoi iho la ia ia Laamaomao, o ka malie koke iho la no ia a pohu haalele loa. A malie iho la, lilo ae la ia ia ka hookele o na waa, aka, ua olelo mua aku o Keawenuiaumi i ke keiki, e holo i Kaula i o Pakaa ala. Mahope o ia olelo ana, pauhia iho la ke ’lii i ka hiamoe a me na kanaka, no ka luhi i ke kai.","When Kuapakaa saw that the enemies of his father, Pakaa, were dead, he closed the wind calabash, Laamaomao, and immediately the storm abated and a great calm came over the ocean. At the coming of the pleasant weather, the office of sailing master was given over to the boy. But before this, the king said to the boy, that he wished to continue the search of Pakaa at Kaula. After giving this order the king and the men all fell asleep, for they were worn out with the efforts to save themselves during the storm."
"A pau lakou i ka hiamoe, pa mai la ka makani maikai ma ka aina mai, hoololi ae la o Kuapakaa i na waa a me ka pea, a holo pono i Hawaii. Ia la a po, a ao ae, ike aku la lakou i ka piko o Maunakea i loko o ka ohu, e maalo ana me he opua la.

Nolaila, olioli lakou i ka hiki i Hawaii, aka, o Keawenuiaumi, he minamina loa ia i kana kauwa ia Pakaa, no ka hiki ole ana i Kaula.","After they had all fallen asleep a fair wind from land sprung up; Kuapakaa then swung the canoe around as well as the sail and sailed straight for Hawaii, all that day and night until daylight of the next day, when they saw the top of Maunakea above the mist, passing and repassing in the distance like a pointed cloud. At this the men all woke up at the call, “There is Hawaii.” Some said that it was not Hawaii; but when they got nearer to Kawaihae, they were made certain that it was Hawaii. This was the cause of great rejoicing amongst the men; but Keawenuiaumi was not at all made happy for he had failed to find his servant Pakaa, and had not reached Kaula."
"O na kanaka a pau o luna, ua pihoihoi lakou no ka pae i ka aina, a ike aku i ka wahine, me ke keiki, nolaila, olelo e aku o Kuapakaa, ia lakou, penei: “E, ehia mea aloha o ke keiki.” Ninau mai lakou: “I ke aha hoi?” I aku o Kuapakaa: “I ka haule i ka hapaina waa.” I mai o Lapakahoe: “I ke aha kou mea e haule ai?” Pane aku o Kuapakaa: “Ua ike aku nei au i ko oukou pihoihoi, e ake no e lele i uka.

O ke keiki ka hoi ka mea aloha, i ka haule i ka hapai waa ana.” O keia mau olelo a Kuapakaa, ua ko io no, aole i hala, ua pololei loa e like me kana olelo wanana mamua.","As the canoe drew near the land the men became excited, for they were to see their wives and children after a long separation. Upon seeing this, Kuapakaa said to them: “Say, what a disappointment it will be for the boy.” They asked: “Why?” Kuapakaa replied: “He will be neglected as soon as the canoe touches land.” Lapakahoe then asked: “Why should you be neglected?” Kuapakaa replied: “I see that you are all excited and are anxious to land; and when you do, and meet your wives and children you will forget me and I will get left, for I have no friends here.” Lapakahoe said: “The king will not forget you, because by you these bones were saved.” “That may be so, but the boy will be forgotten as soon as the canoe touches land.” These words of Kuapakaa were realized and proved too true, as the following events will show."
"A pae aku la lakou i Kawaihae, lele aku la kela mea keia mea i uka, uwe ka wahine, uwe ke keiki, ilaila lakou i lalau ai, poina loa iho la ke keiki. Noho iho la o Kuapakaa i na waa o lakou, i ke ao a me ka po, malalo o na waa, ma keia noho ana, aohe makamaka, o kana ai, o ka ai i maloo a lakou i holo mai ai. [ ]","When they touched land at Kawaihae, everybody landed and there was weeping by the women and by the children, and while doing this, the boy was entirely forgotten. Kuapakaa, not having any other place to go to, stayed by the canoes day and night, sleeping under them at night. In living at this place, the boy had no friends, and the food he lived on was the dried potatoes saved in his log of wood. [ ]"
"Ia ia i noho ai malaila, lohe aku la ia ua malolo o Kohala; a lohe ia, hele aku la i ke kakahiaka nui, e hoa ana keia mau mea elua i ka waa, e holo ai i ka malolo. Olelo aku la o Kuapakaa ia laua: “He waa aha ko olua?” “He waa holo i ka malolo.” “Owau hoi ha kekahi e kau ma ko olua waa?” “Aole, e komo auanei ka waa.” I aku o Kuapakaa: “U. I pono hoi ka holo ana o ka waa, he kaliu kekahi; ina hoi kakou e holo, aole o ko olua haawina ke lilo mai ana ia’u, no ka mea, ua ike no au i ke ano o ka lawaia ana; ina e nui ka loaa ana o ka malolo, e pa kaau ka haawi ana o na pahoe; ina hoi e uuku, e pa kauna ka haawina o na pahoe; nolaila, aole o ko olua haawina ke lilo mai ana ia’u.” A no ka maikai o ka Kuapakaa olelo, nolaila, ae na kanaka nona ka waa e holo o Kuapakaa i ka pahoe malolo.","Some time after this, Kuapakaa heard that the season for flying-fish had commenced at Kohala, so very early one morning he came upon a couple of fishermen, who were fastening on the lashings of their canoe, making preparations for going out fishing for flying-fish. When he saw the men, he said: “What are you two going to do with the canoe?” “We are making ready to go out fishing for flying-fish.” “Will you let me accompany you in your canoe?” “No, it will be too much of an extra load for the canoe . ” Kuapakaa replied: “Do you think so? I believe every canoe ought to have a bailer. If I accompany you, I know that I don’t share with you on your catch. I know how to fish, and if I make a large catch, I will have to share with the rowers; and even if the catch be small, I must share with you on my catch. In this way, you can see, I will not in any way be entitled to a division of your catch.” As the boy spoke pleasantly and in a way, wisely, the men gave their consent and expressed their willingness to take Kuapakaa along with them."
"Holo aku la lakou i ka pahoe malolo, a loaa ka malolo, haawi pa kaau iho la na ia i na pahoe; mahope o laila, hoi mai la lakou. Ma keia hoi ana, hui mai la kekahi waa me ko lakou waa, eono nae kanaka o ia waa, ekolu no hoi lakou nei o ko lakou waa. I aku o Kuapakaa, i kona mau kanaka hoa holo: “E heihei ko kakou waa me ko lakou la waa, a e pili na kaau malolo a kakou me ia waa.” Alaila, huhu iho la kekahi kanaka ia ia, a olelo mai la: “Kahaha! wahi a wai, e eo ia oe na kanaka eono ke heihei?” I aku o Kuapakaa i ke kanaka i olelo mai ia ia: “E hoi hoi ha oe ma kela waa, hui, ahiku oukou o ko oukou waa, a i elua no hoi maua ma keia waa?”","Upon coming to the fishing grounds, several flying-fish were caught, a fair division was then made and they headed for home. On their return they met a canoe which was manned by six paddlers, while the canoe in which Kuapakaa was a paddler had only three. When Kuapakaa saw the other canoe, he said to his two companions: “Let us have a race with that canoe, and make a wager, our flying-fish, that we can beat them.” This proposition angered one of his companions, who said: “Why, who said so? How can you beat six men in a canoe race?” Kuapakaa said to the one who made the answer: “You had better get into that other canoe, making seven of you, and the two of us will race the seven of you.”"
"Pane aku la kekahi kanaka, o ka lua ia: “E lilo auanei ka’u kaau malolo ia oe? E puka aku no auanei ko kaua ikaika i mua o na kanaka makua? Aole e puka.” A lohe o Kuapakaa, olelo aku la ia: “Ou hoi hoi ha ma kela waa, hui awalu oukou, owau no hoi ma keia waa, heihei kakou, o na kaau malolo ka pili a kakou? Ina oukou e pae e i uka, alaila, lilo ka’u mau malolo ia oukou; a ina hoi owau ke pae e i uka, lilo ka oukou mau malolo ia’u.” Ma keia mau olelo a Kuapakaa, ae lakou. Nolaila, nonoi mai la lakou i ka Kuapakaa kaau malolo, e haawi aku ia lakou e paa ai ka pili, i aku o Kuapakaa: “Aole, i ko’u manao, o ka oukou ke haawi mai ia’u e paa ai. No ka mea, ina oukou e eo ia’u, aole e loaa mai, lele aku au aumeume, eha au ia oukou, no ka mea, he nui oukou, hookahi au; a ina au e eo ia oukou, alaila, aole au e aua ia oukou, no ka mea, aole au e lanakila maluna o oukou, hookahi au, he paapu oukou; nolaila, aole oukou e maka’u ia’u.” Ma keia mau olelo maikai a Kuapakaa, ua ae lakou, a hoomakaukau iho la lakou e heihei, kaulike iho la lakou a kupono na waa, oia iho la: “Oia,” o ka manawa ia i hoe ai.","The other man then replied: “I am afraid I will be deprived of my share of our catch. How can our strength be compared to the strength of all such full grown men? We will never be able to beat them.” When Kuapakaa heard this, he said to the man: “You can take the other canoe then, making eight of you, while I shall take this canoe all by myself; and let us place our shares as our wagers. If you get ashore first, you can have my catch and if I make land first I will take your catch.” This satisfied the others and they asked that Kuapakaa hand over his share of the fish for them to hold; but to this Kuapakaa replied: “No, I think you ought to give me the fish and I act as the stake-holder; because if I beat you, you will be apt to keep the stakes, and if I jump in to take it from you, you would beat me, for there are too many of you and I am all alone. But on the other hand, if you beat me, I will not be able to keep the stakes away from you for you are too many for me, you can take the stakes away from me anyhow.” There was nothing wrong in this, so it was agreed, and the fish were handed over to Kuapakaa. Soon after this, the preparations for the race commenced and the canoes were brought to the mark. As soon as the word was given, the paddles all came down with a jerk and away the two canoes went."
"Ia lakou e hoe ana, kaa aku la ka waa o na kanaka ewalu i mua loa, a hala hope loa keia ia lakou la. Kahea ae la keia i ke kupunawahine, ia Laamaomao, e hoouna mai i mau nalu ekolu, i mea e pae ai ko ianei waa.

As soon as Kuapakaa saw this, he called out to his grandmother, Laamaomao, to send him three surfs to carry his canoe to shore. Soon after the call, a large surf came from behind him and then another and another; [ ] by these surfs he was taken ashore. The other people, when they saw the surfs coming, were frightened, they being too large, and so they held back their canoe; in this way Kuapakaa rode in on the surfs alone and landed ahead of the others. As soon as Kuapakaa landed, he took the flying-fish and hid the whole lot within the canoe of Keawenuiaumi. When the others came ashore, they asked of Kuapakaa about the fish, saying: “Where is our fish?” “There is none left, I have given the whole lot away, for I knew it was mine.”"
"A lohe lakou, kahaha iho la i ka lilo o ka ia i ke keiki uuku, nolaila, paa ko lakou manao e heihei hou me ke keiki. I aku lakou ia Kuapakaa: “E heihei hou kakou.” I mai o Kuapakaa: “Aia no i ko oukou manao, aka, eia ka hewa, aohe a’u kumu e pili ai ia oukou.” I mai lakou: “Hookahi no kumu, o na iwi o kakou, ina eo oe ia makou, alaila, make oe ia makou, a ina eo makou ia oe, make makou.” I aku o Kuapakaa i na kanaka makua: “Aohe o’u makemake e pili i na iwi, no ka mea, ina oukou e make ia’u, uwe mai ka oukou mau wahine a me na keiki, a me na makamaka.

They were, however, determined to try again, and proposed another race, saying to Kuapakaa: “Let us have another race.” Kuapakaa replied: “You can satisfy yourselves on that matter; but the trouble is I have nothing to wager against you.” They all said: “There is always one wager, our bones. If we beat you, you forfeit your life to us, and if you should beat us, why we forfeit ours.” Kuapakaa replied: “I do not want to wager our lives, for if I should win, your wives and children and your friends would weep for you; whereas on my side I am all by myself, without a single relative and can afford to die; but this is not the case with you. So therefore, if you think best we will wager some property, for there is my double canoe over there which you can have if you beat me.” The men replied: “That is not your canoe, it belongs to Keawenuiaumi.” Kuapakaa said: “Keawenuiaumi has no canoe there, that is my canoe . They were merely passengers, for I am the one that is keeping it; had the canoe been theirs they would have stayed by it and taken care of it.” The men then replied: “We do not want the canoe. We would much prefer that our lives be the wager.” The boy assented to this, saying: “All right, why not?”"
"Ma ka heihei mua, ua kaulana aku la ia, ma Kohala, Hamakua, Hilo. A ma keia heihei hope ana, olelo aku la na kanaka makua: “I Kau e heihei ai kakou, eono anana ka loa o na waa.” Ua kaulana ae la keia heihei ma Hawaii a puni.","The result of the first race was spread abroad about Kohala, Hamakua and Hilo. In the arrangement for the second race the men said to the boy: “The race must take place in Kau. Each canoe must be six fathoms in length.” This arrangement was also spread abroad until it went the whole round of Hawaii."
"A hiki lakou i Kau, hoomakaukau na waa a kahakai waiho; o ka umu a hamama, o ka wahie a nui, o ke a a waiho ana. O keia mau mea i hoomakaukau ia, no ka mea [ ] e eo ma ka heihei ana, alaila, kalua i ka umu, e like me ka olelo hooholo a lakou. Ma keia heihei ana, he nui ka poe pili kakalalo, mahope o ianei a me lakou la.","When they reached Kau, the canoes were made ready and moored at the beach. The oven was dug, sufficient wood was brought to the place as well as the stones. These things were made ready because they were the means by which death was to be given the defeated ones, according to their agreement. In this second race many people took the [ ] opportunity of offering wagers and accepting the same by the backers of either side; some on the boy and some on the men."
"Hoeu mai la lakou la e holo, i aku keia: “Eia ka hooholo loa o ka kakou hana, ina au i pae e i uka nei, eia ka hooholo loa ana o ka make, eha nalu e hee ai. Penei ke ano, i hee au a i pau na nalu eha, a pae ole oukou i laila, ua maopopo ko oukou make, a pela hoi oukou, e like me a’u; aka, ua make no wau ia oukou he lehulehu oukou.” Ua aelike lakou la i keia olelo.","As the contestants were about to leave shore, for the starting point, the boy said: “Before we start out let us have a final agreement. If I come ashore first, I would not be declared the winner until I have ridden in on four surfs. If I ride the four surfs before you land, then I will be the winner and then you must submit to your fate. This will be the case if you should win. But I suppose you will win anyhow, for there are several of you on your side.” This extra condition was agreed to."
"Ee ae la lakou ma ko lakou waa, eono ka loa, ee no hoi o Kuapakaa ma kona waa eono ka loa. Holo aku la lakou a hiki i kai, i aku o Kuapakaa: “Eia ka pahu ku o kakou.” Hoole mai na kanaka makua: “Aole keia o ka pahu; aia ka pahu ku o kakou a ale ke kai i luna o ka aina, o ia ko kakou wahi e ku ai a heihei.” I aku o Kuapakaa: “He makehewa wale no ia holo ana i kai, he nui hoi oukou, hohe iho la no oukou ia’u hookahi, e heihei ia aku la no paha e kakou i kuanalu, ina ua eo ia oukou. Nolaila, ke hai aku nei au ia oukou, e make ana oukou ia’u, o ka wahine, o ke keiki, o ka makua ka mea aloha.”","The men then boarded their canoe of six fathoms in length and Kuapakaa boarded his canoe, also of six fathoms in length. The two parties then paddled out to sea until they had reached a point which Kuapakaa thought was far enough and so said to the others: “Let us take this as the starting point.” The others refused to accept this, saying: “We will not accept this as the starting point. Let the starting point be at a distance where the water will hide the shores. When we come to that point we will face about.” Kuapakaa replied: “It will be useless for us to go out any further for there are several of you in your canoe. Why should you fear me, who am all alone? If you had started the race at the edge of the line of surfs, you would have won; but I wish to tell you now that I will beat you anyhow, and that it will be a sad thing for your wives, children and parents.”"
"A nalowale na hale o uka, i aku la lakou ia Kuapakaa: “Eia ka pahu ku o kakou.” Ae aku o Kuapakaa; ia wa, hookuku lakou a kaulike na waa, a kupono.

On the start the eight men forged their canoe ahead by their powerful strokes of the paddle, while Kuapakaa fell far behind. Upon seeing this Kuapakaa watched how the others were using their paddles, and when he saw them raise their paddles some distance out of the water, and that they held their paddles high up by which action the water was forced up high at every stroke, causing an eddy to be drawn along behind their canoe, he forced his canoe into the current formed by the eddy behind the other canoe. As soon as he had entered into this current all he had to do was to see that his canoe kept in the current. While the others were forcing themselves to keep ahead of the boy, by using very powerful strokes, the boy followed on behind taking his time; and the faster they went the faster the boy followed them. Whenever the boy saw that the others were slackening up he would call out: “Pull harder so you will win.” When the eight men would hear this, they worked all the harder."
"A kokoke lakou i uka, hoea aku la ka waa nui o na kanaka mamua, a o ko ke keiki hoi mahope, nolaila, hoopaapaa o uka, me ka olelo: “Ua eo ke keiki! ua eo ke keiki!” A mahope o keia leo uwa o uka, hoea aku la ka waa o Kuapakaa i mua o ko na kanaka makua waa, alaila, olioli ke poe mahope o ke keiki, i ke eo ia lakou, pela ka oi ana o ko Kuapakaa waa a pae i uka.

The canoe of Kuapakaa was seen to draw away from the others farther and farther until it reached land first. As soon as Kuapakaa touched shore he grabbed a surf board and swam out to the surf, according to agreement, but instead of going [ ] out to the big surf he took the small ones near the sand, and after he had thus ridden in three times, the eight men landed and were declared beaten by the boy."
"Ma keia heihei ana, ua laha aku la ka lohe ia Keawenuiaumi, i ka make o kekahi mau kanaka ona i ke keiki. Ia wa, noonoo o Keawenuiaumi, a olelo aku: “He oiaio, ina na wahi keiki uuku, a o kahi keiki a makou i holo mai nei, aole e pakele, make io.” Kena aku la o Keawenuiaumi i ka elele, e kii i ke keiki a hele mai, imua ona, e nana ia ia.

A ua noonoo ke ’lii ma ka hoopomaikai ana o ka keiki ia ia i loko o ka make a me ka pilikia.","The result of this race was soon carried to Keawenuiaumi, as well as the fate of the eight men, who were fairly beaten by the boy. When Keawenuiaumi heard this, he said: “Yes, it surely must be so. If that small boy is the same one that came along with us then it is possible. If he is the same, then there is no escape, the men will indeed die.” Keawenuiaumi then sent one of his messengers to go and bring the boy to him, in order that he might see for himself. When the boy arrived, the king saw that it was the very same that had accompanied him to Hawaii. At this the king fell on the boy’s neck and wept, because he knew that he had neglected him since leaving the canoe. The actions of the boy in saving him from death came to the mind of the king in such a way that he felt that he had indeed been neglectful."
"A pau ka uwe ana, ninau aku la o Keawenuiaumi: “I hea kou wahi i noho ai?” “I na waa no o kakou.” “Heaha kau ai, o ka noho ana?” “O kahi koena ai maloo no a kakou i holo mai ai.” A hala ia ninau, ninau hou o Keawenuiaumi: “A o oe no ka i heihei mai nei me na kanaka o’u i Kohala?” Ae aku no o Kuapakaa: “Ae.” “A o oe no ka i heihei hou mai nei?” “Ae.” “Heaha ka oukou pili?” “I ka heihei mua ana, he ia; i keia heihei hou ana mai nei, o na iwi no o makou; nolaila, ua eo no lakou la ia’u, a ke a ala ka umu e kalua ai, a hoi aku wau kalua.”","After the weeping Keawenuiaumi asked of the boy: “Where have you lived all this time?” “By our canoe.” “What did you live on?” “The dry food that was left over, which we had on our journey.” After this the king again asked: “And were you the one who defeated my men in Kohala?” “Yes,” answered Kuapakaa. “And are you the one who has just won in this race?” “Yes.” “What was the wager?” “In the first race we wagered some fish. In the last race we wagered our bones (lives), and I have beaten them again. The fire in the oven is now lit for the baking, on my return the men will be put into the oven.”"
"Alaila, uwe iho la o Keawenuiaumi, me ke kulou i lalo; ninau mai la ke keiki: “E uwe ana oe i ke aha?” “E uwe ana au no o’u kanaka i ka make.” I aku ke keiki; “Aole no’u ka hewa, no lakou no; ua hai aku au, ma ka waiwai no ka pili a makou, ninau mai lakou ia’u, ‘auhea kou waiwai?’ Hai aku au o na waa o kaua, hoole lakou. Makemake no lakou la o na iwi ka pili, nolaila, ae aku au, no ka mea, ua hookaha lakou la i kuu uuku.”","At this the king again wept, with his head bent down low. When the boy saw the king weeping, he asked: “What are you weeping for?” “I am weeping for my men, because they are to die.” The boy said: “It is not my fault; it was of their own making. I proposed that we wager some property and at this they questioned me what property I had to put up, and I told them that I would put up the canoe; but they refused to accept that, and proposed that our bones be the wager. To this I gave my consent because I knew that they were taking advantage of my size.”"
"I mai o Keawenuiaumi: “Auhea oe e ke keiki. Ke noi aku nei au ia oe, e like me kou aloha ia’u, pela oe e aloha mai ai i ka’u noi aku ia oe. No ka mea, i ahona no au ia mau kanaka o’u, ina e make ae ia oe, o ko’u hemahema no ia.

I want to ask you, that since you love me, that you take pity on me and grant my request, that you save my men, for I cannot see how I am to get along if these men are to be put to death; for I will be without any one who will attend to my comfort. Therefore if you love me, these men must live. If you think they must die, then you must kill me first.” At this pleading, Kuapakaa asked: “Do you think more of these men than any other person?” “Yes,” said the king; “but I would not have thought so much of them had I found my servant Pakaa.”"
"I aku o Kuapakaa ia Keawenuiaumi: “Ina he manao nui kou e ola keia mau kanaka ou, aole e loaa o Pakaa ia kaua ke kii aku i Kaula, a ina hoi e hooko mai e make keia poe kanaka, alaila, loaa ko kauwa o Pakaa. No ka mea, oia no ka mea i haalele ai o Pakaa ia oe, no ka nui o au punahele.” I mai o Keawenuiaumi: “E kii oe a loaa mai, alaila, make lakou.” Ia wa, olelo aku o Kuapakaa ia Keawenuiaumi, me ka hai aku o Kuapakaa ia Pakaa: “Aia no i Molokai kahi i noho ai, ia oukou i holo ae nei, o maua no ke kau ana i luna o kahi waa, o ia no kahi pupu mamua o’u e kulou ana i lalo ke poo. O ke kumu [ ] o ke kulou ana, o ike oe ia ia. O ko’u makuakane no ia o Pakaa, owau no kana keiki o Kuapakaa, nona mai no ko’u inoa. No ke akaakaa o ko ili i ka awa, a nana hoi au i ao i na hana a pau ou e ke ’lii.”","Kuapakaa then said to Keawenuiaumi: “If you think more of the welfare of these men, we will never be able to find Pakaa even though we again make another trip to Kaula; but if you allow these men to meet their fate, then you will be able to find your servant Pakaa; for this was the very reason why Pakaa left you; you were keeping too many favorites.” Keawenuiaumi said: “Go and find Pakaa and then these men may die.” At this, Kuapakaa told Keawenuiaumi of Pakaa, his father, saying: “He is now living in Molokai. When you met me on your trip, he was with me sitting in the fore part of the canoe; the old man kept his head bent down. He kept his face down for fear of being recognized by you. Pakaa is my father and I am his son Kuapakaa, named by him, because of the scales of your skin through the use of the awa; [ ] and it was by him that I was educated in all the things pertaining to the office of a king’s personal servant.”"
"Ma keia olelo a Kuapakaa, hoomaopopo loa mai la o Keawenuiaumi me ka ninau hou mai ia ia. Ia wa, hai paa loa aku o Kuapakaa, me ka olelo aku: “Ia oukou i hoi mai ai mai ka lae o Kalaau mai, a pae kakou i uka, o ko malo no ka’u i lawe aku ai nou, o ko kapa no, o ko awa no, o ko apu no; aka, ua ao mai o Pakaa ia’u, e hai au ia oe no’u, a e huna ia ia.”","Upon hearing this revelation from Kuapakaa, Keawenuiaumi wished to know clearly [of his favorite servant], so he asked a few more questions. Kuapakaa then went more into the details, saying: “After you people returned from the Kalaau point, and we all went ashore, it was your own loin cloth that I gave you; the kapa was your own; the piece of awa was your own, but Pakaa had instructed me to tell you that the things were mine in order that his identity be not discovered.”"
"A lohe o Keawenuiaumi i keia mau olelo a Kuapakaa, uwe iho la ia me ka leo nui ia Pakaa, a me ke keiki, o Kuapakaa, a pau ka uwe ana, kena aku la ke ’lii, e make na kanaka ona.","When Keawenuiaumi heard these things from Kuapakaa, he raised his voice and wept for Pakaa and the boy Kuapakaa. When his weeping was ended he ordered one of his chiefs, that the men who were beaten by the boy be put to death."
"A make lakou, kena aku la o Keawenuiaumi, e kii wikiwiki o Kuapakaa, ia Pakaa a lawe mai. Kau aku la o Kuapakaa maluna o ka waa heihei ona, a holo aku la i ka wanaao, a kiekie ka la, komo i Molokai, hekau iho la no ka waa i kai me ka pae ole i uka, kii aku la ia Pakaa.","After the death of these men, Keawenuiaumi ordered Kuapakaa to go immediately, as fast as possible, and bring Pakaa to him. With this order, Kuapakaa boarded his racing canoe and set out that early morning. When the sun was high up in the heaven, the boy entered the landing place at Molokai and moored his canoe; after this was done he went after Pakaa."
"A hiki aku la ia, aloha a pau ke aloha ana, ninau mai o Pakaa: “Ua make o’u hoapaio?” “Ae, ia makou i holo ai, a Waimea i Kauai, huai au ia Laamaomao, loaa makou i ka ino, ia loaa ana, haawi au i na ao loulu, a koe o Hookeleihilo a me Hookeleipuna; pela ka ai, me ka ia, ka wai, a make iho la laua.

A make na kanaka, hai aku nei au ia oe a me a’u i ke ’lii, ia Keawenuiaumi, a nolaila au i kii mai la ia oe, e holo kaua.” Ninau mai o Pakaa: “Heaha na pono a ko haku ia oe?” “Aole.” “Ae, o hoi hou a olelo aku i ko haku, i olelo mai nei o Pakaa ia’u, aia ka a hoihoi mai oe i na aina au i lawe ai, a me na mea a pau au i lawe ai, alaila, ae e hoi mai me oe, a i ae ole oe, aole e hoi mai.”","When he reached their home, the boy greeted his father and after the exchange of the greetings, Pakaa inquired: “Are my opponents dead?” “Yes. After we had sailed off and while outside of Waimea, Kauai, I uncovered Laamaomao and immediately we were encompassed by a great and terrible storm. In the midst of this storm, I gave out the palm leaves to the men, all with the exception of Hookeleihilo and Hookeleipuna. The food also was not given them, nor the meat and water; and being exhausted, the two died. We then left Kauai and set sail for Hawaii while all the people were asleep, and after a time we landed at Kawaihae, where I was neglected by my master and his men. Some time shortly after this I got into a race with some of the king’s men whom I defeated and they were put to death. After the men were put to death I told the king of you and me, and he sent me to bring you; therefore, I have come for you to go back with me.” At this Pakaa asked: “What has your master given you?” “Nothing.” “Then go back and tell your master that Pakaa has sent word that until the king has restored all the lands taken back by him, as well as all the other things, I will not come back. Restore these things and I will come.”"
"A pau ka olelo a Pakaa i ke keiki, holo mai la ia a hiki i Hawaii, a lohe o Keawenuiaumi i na olelo a Pakaa, ae mai la i na mea a pau loa, aole kekahi mea e koe i ka hoihoi ia me Pakaa, wahi a Keawenuiaumi: “Ke ae aku nei au e hoi mai ia a noho pu me a’u.” Ia wa, i hao ai o Kuapakaa i kona mana a holo aku la a pae i Molokai, hai aku la i na olelo a Keawenuiaumi a pau loa, a lohe ia, kau iho la i luna o ka waa a hoi aku la ia Hawaii.","At the close of this conversation, between the boy and the father, the boy set out for Hawaii and in time delivered the message to Keawenuiaumi. When the king heard the conditions proposed by his servant Pakaa, he agreed to them all, withholding nothing of which Pakaa wanted, saying: “I am willing to do all this in order that I may get him to come back to me.” Again Kuapakaa set out for Molokai, where he landed and delivered the order of Keawenuiaumi. When Pakaa heard the reply of the king, he boarded the canoe and returned to Hawaii."
"A hiki i mua o Keawenuiaumi, lele mai la ia iluna o Pakaa, a uwe kaukau iho la, no kona hana ino i ke kauwa maikai, a pau ka uwe ana, haawi aku la o Keawenuiaumi ia Hawaii a puni ia Pakaa, a noho alii iho la ia e like me mamua, alaila pau keia kaao. [ ]","When Pakaa came in the presence of Keawenuiaumi, Keawenuiaumi fell on Pakaa and wept, and begged to be forgiven for the bad treatment given to a faithful servant. After the weeping, Keawenuiaumi gave to Pakaa the whole of Hawaii, thus placing him back in the same position held by him before. This is the end of this story. [ ]"

Palila at his birth was in the form of a piece of cord and was therefore thrown away in a pile of rubbish, the parents not knowing that it was a child, and furthermore they were disappointed upon seeing the cord. When Palila was born, Hina [the grandmother] was living in the temple of Humuula up in the mountains; but through her supernatural powers she saw the birth of Palila, so she came down to Mahinui and Kaluaopalena and asked them: “Where is the child that was born a short time ago?” Mahinui and Kaluaopalena replied: “There was no child, it was a piece of cord; it is lying there in that rubbish pile.” Hina went over to the place and took up the piece of cord from amongst the rubbish and bundled it up in a piece of white kapa and returned to her home."
"Noho iho la o Hina i loko o Humuula, i loko o ke kuahiwi mehameha loa me ke kanaka ole, a liuliu, kii aku la i ka wahi o Palila, wehe ae la, a wahi hou i ka oloa.

This was done at three different times, when it began to assume human form. After the lapse of a full period of ten days, the body of Palila was complete in its form. Hina then built a shelf from the uluhe fern and placed the child upon it. After the child had reached the age when it could take food, it was given nothing but bananas."
"No Alanapo: He wahi kapu loa ia, he heiau, aia i loko o Humuula, he wahi noho no ke ’kua, a he wahi kaulana loa, no ka ikaika a me ke koa o ko laila kanaka ke noho.

Ma keia noho ana o Palila, elua ano, he ’kua, he kanaka.","Alanapo was another very sacred place; it was also a temple and was located in the land of Humuula. It was the resort of spirits and a place noted for the strength and braveness of the people brought up in it. When Hina saw that the child was full grown she took him to the temple of Alanapo and brought him up with the spirits, where he was educated in the arts of warfare and in all the training proper for the development of great strength. After the years of training his two hands were equally developed and could deal out death to all his enemies. In his daily life and bringing up, he had a twofold character; that of a spirit and of a human being."
"Namakaokalani, oia ke ’lii ma kekahi aoao o Kauai, e noho ana laua me ke kaua me Kaluaopalena, ekolu kaua i hala, a hookahi kaua i koe, a puni loa ka aina ia Namakaokalani.","One half of Kauai at this time was under the control of Namakaokalani, who was constantly at war with Kaluaopalena [the father of Palila, the ruler of the other half of Kauai]. Three battles had already been fought by the two and there remained but one more when Namakaokalani, if victorious, would conquer the whole island of Kauai."
"He mea mau ia Hina ka iho e nana i ke kaua o na aoao elua, i na kaua ana a pau loa, ma keia iho ana a Hina, ua kau aku ia ia ka halialia o Palila. Nolaila, olelo mua aku o Hina ia Kaluaopalena: “E, nana oe ma keia la, ina i hele mai ke koa mua, o Namakaokalani [ ] ia, no Moloaa, mai hea oe; i hele mai o Lupeakawaiowainiha, he koa ia, mai hea oe; aka, i hele mai ke koa e hookaa ana ka laau ma ka hema, o Palila ia, ko keiki ia, mai loko mai o Alanapo, o ke koa ia puni o Kauai nei ia oe.

On this occasion Hina went down and arrived before the commencement of hostilities; she felt that Palila was coming down to see the battle, so upon meeting Kaluaopalena she said to him: “You must be on the watch this day. The first warrior who will come to you will be Namakaokalani [ ] from Moloaa; don’t call him. The second will be Lupeakawaiowainiha, who is a warrior; don’t call him. But, when a warrior comes twirling his war club on the left, that will be Palila, your own son, who comes from the temple of Alanapo. He will be the warrior by whose aid you will conquer the whole of Kauai. Call him to you; if perchance he will be pleased with you, you will live; but if he gets angry you will be slain together with your men.”"

When he looked about him and saw that Hina was not around, he rose, took up his war club, Huliamahi by name, given to him by the gods, and came out of the sacredness of Alanapo. He continued on his way until he was outside of the limits of Humuula, and went through a forest of tall trees until he arrived at a rise looking toward the sea. This rise is Komoikeanu. When Palila arrived at this rise he looked down and saw two great armies gathered at Paa. Palila knew by the action of the men that a battle was about to be fought and against his father Kaluaopalena. He therefore turned and proceeded along the upper part of Hanapepe through the brush and tall trees. When Palila got into the forest he swung his club, Huliamahi, knocking down the trees. By reason of the falling of the trees one on top of another, they kept on falling until the trees standing around one of the armies were also knocked down, destroying a large portion thereof, leaving Kaluaopalena’s intact. Those who heard Hina announce the coming of Palila were all afraid upon seeing the forest mowed down, therefore Namakaokalani immediately sent his messengers to ask Kaluaopalena to call off the battle and to make peace."
"A lohe o Kaluaopalena i keia mau olelo a na elele, hoole aku: “Aole e pau ke kaua a lanakila au, no ka mea, o ka’u hana ke kaua a lolo nui ke poo, nolaila, o ka la keia puni o Kauai nei ia’u.” O ke kumu o keia olelo a Kaluaopalena pela, no kona lohe ana ia Palila, e iho mai ana e halawai me ia, a o ke kumu no hoi ia i makau ai kekahi aoao. Ma kahi a Palila i uhau ai i ka laau palu ana, aohe laau ulu, aohe nahelehele, a hiki i keia la.","When Kaluaopalena heard the message, he refused to call the battle off, saying: “I will not call the battle off until I am victorious, for I have laid awake nights until my head was made heavy planning for this battle. I know that I will conquer the whole of Kauai this day.” The reason why Kaluaopalena said this was because he had heard that Palila was coming to meet him, and it was also this which caused the other side to sue for peace. On whichever side Palila swung his club no trees or shrubs remained standing, and none grow to this day."
"Ia Palila e iho mai ana e halawai me Kaluaopalena, hele mai o Namakaokalani, he koa ia no Moloaa, e halawai me Kaluaopalena, me kana laau palau, elua kanaha kanaka nana e amo, hookahi mamua, hookahi mahope o ka laau ma waena.

No ka mea, ua kapu loa ka leo o Kaluaopalena a noa ia Palila, e like me ka olelo a Hina.","While Palila was on his way to meet Kaluaopalena, Namakaokalani the warrior from Moloaa, with his war club, came to meet Kaluaopalena. This war club was so large that it required eighty men to carry it, forty at one end and forty at the other. When Namakaokalani arrived in the presence of Kaluaopalena, he stood up his war club, called Kawalowai, in the presence of the people; but Kaluaopalena would not call him to come on his side; he was so ashamed that he thereupon returned to Moloaa. After Namakaokalani came Lupeakawaiowainiha, another great warrior. It is said that every time he urinated the land would be flooded. He, too, came with his war club, called Kalalea. This war club was so large that it required one hundred and twenty men to carry it. When he arrived in the presence of Kaluaopalena, he took his war club and twirled it over his head and then down under his chin, causing the people to shout with admiration at his cleverness; but Kaluaopalena would not call him and he [ ] was so ashamed that he went home to Hanalei. Kaluaopalena, according to the instructions from Hina was patiently waiting for Palila and consequently did not utter a word when the two warriors stood before him."
"Mahope o laua, hiki mai o Palila hookahi mile paha ke kaawale ma waena o Palila a me Kaluaopalena, e hili akau mai ana o Palila i kana laau palau, ia Huliamahi, pau loa na laau i ka hina, a koe ke kumu lehua nui, o ke kino lehua ia o Palila. Ua pau loa na kanaka i ka luku ia e na laau ma ka hina ana, aohe kanaka pakele o ko Kaluaopalena poe, o ka poe ma kahi laau ole kai pakele, o ka poe pee a holo aku i loko o na laau, ua make.","After these two warriors came Palila. While he was yet a mile distant from Kaluaopalena, Palila swung his war club, Huliamahi, causing all the trees to fall with the exception of one lehua tree, it being the supernatural body of Palila himself. The trees in falling killed many. None escaped except Kaluaopalena’s people, who were standing away from the trees. Those who ran and hid in the woods were killed."
"A hiki o Palila i mua o Kaluaopalena, hele mai la o Kaluaopalena me ke kokolo a mua o Palila, moe iho la i lalo ke alo, a kahea ae la: “E Kalani e! hou ia ko laau.” Ninau mai o Palila: “I hea au, i uka, i kai, i nae, i lalo?” I aku o Kaluaopalena: “I ka ihu o ka puaa a me ka ia ula oe.” Hou iho ana o Palila i ka laau palau ana, ia Huliamahi, i lalo, a koe ka welau i luna, oia kela aina o Waihohonu, nolaila, kona nakele a hiki i keia la, a nolaila kona hohonu. O na kanaka a pau loa, pau i ka moe i lalo, aohe kanaka a ala ae i luna, ala no make.","When Palila arrived in the presence of Kaluaopalena, Kaluaopalena came crawling to Palila, and when near him fell flat, face down, and called out: “Ye heavenly offspring, hold out your club.” Palila inquired: “Where shall it be? Toward the uplands, toward the lowlands, to the east or downward?” Kaluaopalena answered: “At the killing of the pig and the red fish.” Palila then pushed his war club, Huliamahi, downward until only the point of it remained above ground. That was the land of Waihohonu, therefore its miry condition to this day and its deep depression. At this all the people fell down, not one daring to remain standing for fear of death."
"A he kanawai hoi ko Palila, o ka a-ka, aia a a-ka o Palila, alaila noa, walaau, ku a hele, holoholo, eia nae, aole lakou i ike ia kanawai, nolaila, ua pilihua loa lakou.

Noa ae la ke kanawai o Palila, ala ae la na kanaka a pau i luna, hele mai la o Hina, a ka mai a Palila, kahe, a paa i ka oloa, a hoi aku la i uka o Alanapo.","It was a law with Palila that whenever he laughed the kapu would end; people could then stand up, speak, or run about. The people did not, however, know this, so they remained lying down. While they were all in this position Hina arrived and she stood on a little rise called Alea [known as Maunakilika at the present time], with the robe of Palila, called Hakaula and the malo of Palila called Ikuwa. Hina then uncovered herself to nakedness, and rolled over the backs of the people, which caused Palila to laugh and released the kapu, when they all arose. The reason of this laughter was her own condition, called Lehokukuwau. She then approached Palila, circumcised and bound him with oloa kapa , after which they returned up to Alanapo."
"A hala ke anahulu o ka noho ana o Palila i loko o Alanapo, ikaika loa kona manao e hele e hakaka, e kaua me na kupu, a me na ’lii. Iaia e noho ana i loko o Alanapo, ua hiki aku ia ia ka halialia o Kamaikaahui, he mano kanaka ia no Maui.","After Palila had been in Alanapo more than ten days the desire to go and fight the chiefs of other lands and the demi-gods of the deep began to grow in him until at last he decided to go and meet them. Before he left Alanapo he had a premonition of meeting Kamaikaahui, a human shark which was living in Maui."
"No Kamaikaahui: O Muolea ma Hana, i Maui ka aina o Kamaikaahui i noho ai; ekolu ona kino, o ka mua ka iole, o ka lua ka maia, o ke kolu ka mano. He iole ke kino mua i ka wa uuku, a pii i luna o ka maia me ke kino iole, lilo he ahui maia. I ka wa o ka mea maia i kii aku ai i ka maia, lalau iho la i na eka o luna a lawe mai la, koe o lalo iho. Ia wa lilo ka waha ma ke kua a me na niho, a lilo ae la he kino kanaka maoli, ma ke kua nae na niho mano, o kana hana o ka ai i ke kanaka.","Kamaikaahui at this time was living at Muolea, Hana, Maui. He had come through three different forms: first , that of a rat; second, a bunch of bananas; and third, that of a shark. It was when he was very small that he had the form of a rat, but on climbing a banana tree he changed into a bunch of bananas. After a while when the owner of the patch of bananas came to pick the bunch he took the top hands only, leaving the lower ones, when it changed into a human being having a shark’s mouth and teeth in the back below the neck, and it thereupon began to have a desire for human flesh."
"O ka Kamaikaahui hana, o ka mahiai ai i ke alanui i na la a pau loa. Ia ia e mahiai ana, iho mai la ka poe auau kai, a poe lawaia hooluuluu. Ninau aku la o Kamaikaahui: [ ] “Heaha ka oukou auau kai?” “He lele kawa.” “E pau wawae auanei.” A iho lakou la, mahope keia a loko o ke kai, ai mai la ma na wawae a pau, pela kai nei hana mau ana, ina he hooluuluu ka lawaia, pau poo ia ia nei.","Kamaikaahui’s occupation was that of a farmer, and to suit his taste he had his fields near the public highway. While at his work he could see the people on their way sea bathing or on their way to fish. As people passed down he would ask: “What [ ] kind of bathing are you going to have?” “We are going to leap from the rocks.” He would then say: “Your feet will be bitten.” After the people had passed on their way to the sea, he would then follow on behind and jump into the sea and begin to bite off the feet of the bathers. This was carried on every time the people went bathing and they never once suspected him. If the people were on their way to dive for fish their heads would be bitten off and eaten by Kamaikaahui."
"He mea mau i keia kanaka ka paa mau ana o kona kihei i na la a pau loa, aole e hemo iki, no ka huna i ka waha ma ke kua, o ike ia. Nolaila, he la koele na ko Maui alii, o Kamaikaahui kekahi i laila, ua uluhua na mea a pau loa i ka paa mau o ke kihei o Kamaikaahui, nolaila, olelo ia e wehe ke kapa o na mea a pau loa.

O ka aina ana i wehe ai a haalele i ke kapa, a lele ai i loko o ke kai, o Kauhalahala ka inoa o ia aina a hiki i keia la, no kona hala wale ana i ko na kanaka lima.","It was his custom to always have a piece of kapa wrapped around his back and he never went without it, because it was to cover up the mouth at his back, for he did not wish to have it seen. One day during one of the king’s working days at which Kamaikaahui was present, with the piece of kapa on his back, the people having seen him thus covered at all times made up their mind to see why his back was always covered. A general order was therefore issued in which everybody was requested to uncover their back. This was followed by everybody except Kamaikaahui. When he was requested to uncover his back he at once attempted to escape and ran off, threw down his clothes and jumped into the sea where he turned into a shark. The place where he left his clothes is to this day known as Kauhalahala, given to it because he successfully escaped from the hands of the people."
"A ma ke kino mano ia i hele mai ai a noho i Waipahu ma Waikele i Ewa. A noho o Kamaikaahui i laila, e like me kana hana i Maui, pela no i Ewa, ina e hakaka a kaa ka hoapaio malalo, nanahu iho la no na niho ma ke kua, a moku. Pela no kana hana mau ana, a lilo iho la ia i mea makau ia na Ewa, a noho iho la ia he ’lii maoli maluna o na kanaka.","After transforming himself into a shark he came to Waipahu in Waikele, Oahu, where he remained. As soon as he was settled in the place he again followed the same practice that he did in Maui. Every time he got his opponent under him his mouth at the back would bite and eat the man. This was done so often that the people of Ewa began to get afraid of him, and he lived as a king over them."
"No Palila: Lalau iho la o Palila i kana laau palau ia Huliamahi, a ku iho la i luna o ke ahua o Komoikeanu ma waho mai o Humuula, oniu i ka laau ana, ia oniu ana a pahu, hue mai la ka laau mamua, paa mai la o Palila ma ka elau, a ku ana i luna o Nualolo, i ka puu o ahi o Kamaile. Nana keia o Kahiki, a pau, huli nana ia Oahu nei, a paa ka manao ma Oahu nei, e pahu mai ana keia ia Huliamahi, kau ana i ka lae o Kaena keia, ma Waianae.","On the day that Palila decided to leave home, he took up his war club, Huliamahi, and came out of Humuula and stood on the knoll of Komoikeanu, swung his war club, pointed it in front of him and let the club fly. As the club flew he hung on to one end of it and he was carried by it until he landed on the cliff of Nualolo on the top of the hill of Kamaile, the hill from which the fire sticks are thrown. As he stood on the hill he first looked towards Kahiki, then towards Oahu; then making up his mind to come to Oahu, he pushed his war club ahead of him and again he was carried by it until he landed on the Kaena point at Waianae."
"Haalele keia ia Kaena, hele mai la a Kalena, a Pohakea, Maunauna, Kanehoa, a ke kula o Keahumoa, nana ia Ewa. Ku keia i laila nana i ke ku a ka ea o ka lepo i na kanaka, e pahu aku ana keia i ka laau palau aia nei i kai o Honouliuli, ku ka ea o ka lepo, nu lalo o ka honua, me he olai la, makau na kanaka holo a hiki i Waikele.

At this place he stood and looked at the dust as it ascended into the sky caused by the people who had gathered there; he then pushed his war club toward Honouliuli. When the people heard something roar like an earthquake they were afraid and they all ran to Waikele. When Palila arrived at Waikele he saw the people gathered there to witness the athletic games that were being given by the king of Oahu, Ahuapau by name. His palace was situated at Kalaepohaku, close to Wailuakio at Kapalama."
"No Ahuapau: He ’lii kapu loa ia i ka makani a me ka ua, he ’lii kapu i ka nana aku, a no kona kapu, ua paa i loko o ka manele a me ka puloulou, ke hele i waho o ke [ ] alanui.

A ua olelo hoi ua ’lii la i kana olelo, ina o ke kanaka e holo ai, a e make ai o Kamaikaahui, e lilo ia i alii nui no Oahu nei.","Ahuapau was a kapu chief and he was kept covered up away from the wind and rain. On going out he was carried from place to place inclosed in a palanquin, so high [ ] and sacred was his rank. He had two very fast runners, called Iomea and Ioloa. Every time the king traveled to Waikele to witness the games he would climb into his palanquin and be covered up and would only venture out in this way, whether on the way down or on the way home. This king had a certain fear of Kamaikaahui and because of this fear he had issued an order, that whoever was able to chase Kamaikaahui out of Oahu, or was able to kill him, that he would make that person the chief ruler of Oahu."
"O Palila hoi, mawaho ia o ka aha e kalewa nei me kana olelo i mua o ka lehulehu, “ina e ike o Kamaikaahui ia ia, alaila holo.” A lohe ke ’lii i keia mau olelo a Palila, olelo mai ke ’lii: “Ina he oiaio e holo o Kamaikaahui i keia la ia oe, alaila nau e komo kuu heiau kapu.” Mahope o keia olelo ana, hoike o Palila ia Kamaikaahui, holo o Kamaikaahui i loko o ke kai, e hoomoe aku ana o Palila i ka laau palau, hoi hou i uka, waihowale ke kino, ike ia ka waha a me ka niho me ke kua, a make iho la.","When Palila arrived at the place he remained on the outside of the crowd and said that if Kamaikaahui would see him he would run away. When this was carried to the king Palila was sent for and as he stood in the presence of the king, the king addressed him, saying: “If it is true that Kamaikaahui will run away from you this day, then you will be the first one to enter my sacred temple.” Soon after this Palila made himself known to Kamaikaahui. At sight of Palila, Kamaikaahui attempted to escape by running into the sea, but Palila pushed out his club, forcing Kamaikaahui to come back. He was then caught and uncovered and the people saw his mouth and sets of teeth at his back; he was then killed."
"O Papakolea, he kanaka mahiai ia, o Koiuiu kana wahine, o Leleo ka aina, aia a oo ka ai ana, alaila, komo ka heiau o Kanelaauli ma Kahehuna, ma ke alo o Puowaina.

A o ke ’lii hoi o Ahuapau, akahi no a hele ma ka wakae, a me ka lepo, akahi hoi a pa ia e ka makani.","Papakolea was a farmer and his wife was Koiuiu; they lived at Leleo. It was promised him that when his crops were ripe that the temple of Kanelaauli, at Kahehuna, just at the base of Punchbowl hill, would be opened to the public. When Papakolea saw Palila he said to Ahuapau, the king: “Say, here is the young man who will conquer the whole island for you; give him your daughters to wife.” Ahuapau had two daughters, Kaalamikioi and Kalehuawai. Upon hearing this the priest Kahikoluamea said: “Don’t give him your daughters yet; let us wait a while. He is not quite human as he is partly spirit, being so by the influence of Mahinui, his mother. He has been brought up under strict kapus in the temple of Alanapo by the spirits and is therefore not quite human.” At this Ahuapau asked: “What are we to do then?” Kahikoluamea replied: “Put him on the palanquin and let your runners carry him with all haste into the temple, where he shall be kept under a strict kapu until we have worked over him and have transformed him into a perfect human being, when everything will be well.” Palila was then placed in the palanquin and he was carried off by the two runners into the temple of Kanelaauli, at Kahehuna, without allowing a single breath of wind to strike him. The king Ahuapau in the meantime walked on the ground for the first time and the wind also for the first time blew on him."
"A komo o Palila iloko o ka heiau o Kanelaauli, ninau mai na kahuna: “Heaha keia?” I aku na kukini: “He ’lii kapu no Alanapo i Kauai; e kau ka pae humu o ka heiau, a e hookani ka pahu me ka puniu.” A ao ka po, hana iho la na kahuna ia Palila, kahe pono ia ka mai, a pau ia, noa iho la kona kino a lilo iho la i kino kanaka maoli.

Let the railing of the temple be put up, let the drum be beaten and the coconut rattlers rattle.” On the next day the priests worked on Palila and he was also properly circumcised. He was then transformed into a perfect human being. After the ceremonies Palila was allowed to live with his wives, the daughters of Ahuapau. Soon after this Ahuapau told Palila to make a circuit of Oahu, to which Palila consented."
"Ninau aku o Palila: “Aohe kupu, a alai o ke alanui a puni Oahu nei?” “Aole,” [ ] pela mai o Ahuapau; he manao huna ko Ahuapau ia Palila, e ake ana no e make o Palila. Olelo aku o Palila: “Ae, i hele au, a i halawai me ke kolohe, alaila, pepehi au a make, hoi mai au pepehi ia oe a me kou mau kanaka a pau loa.” Ma keia olelo a Palila, makau o Ahuapau, hai aku la ia Olomana, aia i Kaelepulu i Koolau, he koa ia. I mai o Palila: “Ola oe ia’u, e huna oe, ina ua make.”","But before starting out Palila asked Ahuapau: “Are there any lawless obstructions [ ] along the road surrounding Oahu?” “None,” said Ahuapau. This was, however, a lie, as Ahuapau was even at this time determined to have Palila killed. Palila then said to Ahuapau: “Yes, I am going on my way and in case I meet some one who will attempt to harm me, I will first kill him and then I will return and kill you and all your men.” At this Ahuapau was frightened and told of Olomana, who was living at Kaelepulu in Koolau and was a great warrior. Palila then said: “I will not kill you now; but had you kept it from me you would have been killed.”"
"Pii aku la o Palila a luna o Puowaina, nana ma o a ma o, hele aku la a hiki i Nuuanu, hoomoe i ka laau palau ana, paa aku la o Palila mahope, holo aku la a hiki i Kaelepulu, ilaila o Olomana kahi i ku ai.","Palila then climbed to the top of Punchbowl hill and looked around him. From this place he walked up to the Nuuanu pali, pushed his war club ahead of him, holding on to one end and flew to Kaelepulu, where he saw Olomana standing."
"No Olomana: He kanaka loihi ia ke nana aku, he umikumamalua kahaku o ke kua, he umikumamakolu o ke alo, he kanaka koa a me ka makau ia; aole alii, aole koa aa aku ia ia, lulu ka makani ia ia ke ku ma ka hikina, malu no hoi ka la no kona kiekie.","Olomana was a very tall man, he being twelve yards to the shoulders, and thirteen in height. He was a very brave man and was much feared. No chief or warrior dared face him. If he stood on the windward side the other side would be a perfect calm; his height also shaded the sun."
"A ike o Palila ia Olomana, lele pu ae la o Palila i luna me ka laau palau ana me Huliamahi, a kau i ka poohiwi o Olomana.

Olomana then turned and said to Palila: “Where are you from, you haughty youngster? No one has ever dared, before this day, to climb up my shoulders; and here you have done it.” Palila then answered: “I am Palila who was brought up in Alanapo, the temple of the gods from the very beginning of all things, and I have come to fight you.” When Olomana heard this, he was sorely afraid, for he knew that those who come from the temple of Alanapo are men richly endowed with supernatural powers and very great warriors; so Olomana begged: “Let me live, Palila.” Palila replied: “I cannot save you; you shall indeed die, for your works have been of evil.” Palila then struck him, cutting him in two; one portion flew toward the sea, being Mahinui, and the other portion remained where he stood, being the present hill of Olomana. It was because of this that the hill is so sharp at the peak. This was how Olomana, the great soldier of Oahu, was killed by Palila."

Upon seeing him Kahului called, so Palila went to Kahului and they sat down and began to talk on various matters. That afternoon the men and women came along the shore in the pools to catch minnows for bait, for aku fishing for tomorrow. Palila again asked: “How about us two?” “But I have no one to assist me in paddling the canoe because I have a very large one, it being seven fathoms in length.” Palila then said: “The two of us will paddle it in order to make it go.” They then started out and caught some minnows which they kept for the next day."
"Eia nae, i ke kakahiaka nui, ua pau loa na kanaka i ka holo i kai i ka lawaia, aohe kanaka nana e hapai ka waa; nolaila, olelo aku o Kahului ia Palila: “Aole e hiki ana ka waa i ka hapai, aohe kanaka e hiki ai.” I aku o Palila: “Mamua oe e hapai ai, mahope [ ] aku nei au, mai nana mai oe i hope nei.” Ia pahu ana no a Palila, lana i loko o ke kai, ka waa. Mamua o Palila o ka waa me na hoe eiwa, mahope o Kahului me kana hoe. Lalau aku la o Palila i ka hoe, a hou iho i lalo, a kai ae, ua haki, pela a pau na hoe eiwa, olelo mai o Kahului: “Aole e hiki ka waa o kaua, aohe hoe, e hoi kaua.” Lalau iho la o Palila i ka laau palau ana, a hoe iho la, hookahi mapuna hoe, hele ana laua nei ma lalo o Kawaihoa, hiki i Kolo, he ko’a ia.","In the early morning when they came out they found that all the others had gone before them; so Kahului thought they would not be able to get their canoe into the sea; he then turned to Palila and said: “We will not be able to get our canoe into the sea as there are no men to assist us. ” Palila replied: “You get in front and lift while I lift the [ ] after part here; but you must not look behind.” Palila gave the canoe one shove and it floated in the sea; he then jumped in the fore part of the canoe and took up nine paddles while Kahului jumped into the after part and took up his paddle. After they were ready to start Palila took up one paddle and with one stroke broke it in two; so he took up another paddle and that too was broken; this was kept up until all the nine paddles were broken. Kahului then said to Palila: “Let us return for we have no more paddles to work the canoe with.” Palila then took up his war club and used it as a paddle; he took but one stroke and they went skimming along beyond Kawaihoa, then on to Kolo, the great fishing grounds."
"Ma keia holo ana, ua mahalo o Kahului i ka ikaika o Palila, lawaia iho la o Kahului, aohe loaa o ke aku, no ka pau o ka makau i ka mokumoku. I aku o Palila: “Ahea loaa ka kaua ia?” I mai o Kahului: “He ia ke kai, o ka lou ole ka hewa i ka makau. O ka makau ia e mokumoku nei, aohe make ae o ka ia, ua pau loa na makau, a koe no hookahi i koe.” Olelo aku o Palila: “E hoi mai oe mamua nei e hoe ai i ka waa o kaua, owau ke hoi aku e lawaia.” Ae mai la o Kahului.","When Kahului saw how fast they were traveling he admitted the great strength displayed by Palila. Upon arriving at the fishing grounds Kahului proceeded to fish, but after several trials he was unable to catch any aku, for all his hooks were broken. After a time Palila asked: “When are we to catch some fish?” Kahului replied: “The sea is full of fish, but the trouble is I cannot catch any. Here I have lost several hooks, but I have not been able to land a single fish. I have used up all my hooks except one.” Palila then said: “You come in front here and paddle our canoe along, and I will come and fish.” This was done by Kahului."
"Lalau iho la o Palila i ka laau palau ana ia Huliamahi, a mali iho la i ka iao a waiho aku la o lalo, lele mai la ke aku e ai, ka ae la keia i luna o ka waa i ke aku, pela no ka hana ana a komo ka waa o laua i ka ia. Hoi aku la laua a pae i uka, olelo aku la o Palila ia Kahului: “E hoi oe e pulehu ia, na’u e hapai ka waa o kaua.” Hookahi no panee ana kau ka waa i ke aki.",Palila then took up his war club and tied the bait on to it and let it down to the sea. The fish then gathered on to the club in great numbers. When Palila saw this he jerked up the club and the fish dropped into the canoe. He repeated this several times until the canoe was loaded down deep with fish. They then returned to the landing. When they reached the landing Palila said to Kahului: “You go on ahead and broil me some of the fish and I will lift the canoe ashore.” Palila then gave the canoe one shove and it landed high and dry and onto its blocks.
"Moa ae la ka ia, ai iho la laua. Noho iho la laua a hala he mau la, haalele o Palila ia Kahului no ke pi. Hele aku la ia a luna o Hanauma, nana aku la i ka enaena o ke pili o Kaunakahakai, i Molokai, pahu aku la ia i kana laau palau, a maluna o laila ia i hiki ai a Kaluakoi. Ilaila, waiho ia i kekahi aoao o kona mai, oia o Kalaeokalaau a hiki i keia la, mamuli o ka mai o Palila ia inoa.","After the fish was cooked they sat down to their meal. After a few days Palila left Kahului because he was too stingy, and he again continued on his journey along the coast until he arrived on the rise of Hanauma, where he stood and looked at the heat as it ascended from the pili grass at Kaunakakai, Molokai. He then pushed out his war club ahead of him which flew through the air and he was carried to Kaluakoi. Here he discarded a portion of his person which turned into the point of Kalaeokalaau, which is seen to this day, so named in honor of Palila."
"Aia i laila, he laau nui, o Hooneenuu kona inoa. No keia inoa o ka laau o Hooneenuu, hoowahawaha o Palila ia Molokai, ma kona manao, he kiona keia laau, nolaila, haalele iho la o Palila ia Molokai, a holo aku la. Pahu aku la ia i kana laau palau mamua, mahope o Palila, a pae laua ma Kaunolu i Lanai, malaila aku a Kahoolawe, malaila aku a Pohakueaea i Honuaula.","There was at this place a large stick of wood to which was given the name of Hooneenuu. Because of this name, Hooneenuu, Palila took a dislike to Molokai, so he again pushed out his war club and flew to Kaunolu, Lanai. From this place he crossed over to Kahoolawe and from there to Pohakueaea in Honuaula. At this place he sat down and rested."
"Alaila, noho iho la i laila hoomaha, pahu hou i ka ihe ana, hiki i Kaula ma Hamakua i Hawaii, ka mokuna o Hilo me Hamakua. Hele aku la a loaa ko Hina muli o Lupea, noho ana i Kaawalii, maluna mai, he kahu hanai no ia no Palila.

A he heiau no hoi ko Hilo o Humuula, e like me ko Kauai heiau o Humuula, a he kapu no, a he ’kua no, a he mana no, ua like a like.","After resting for some time he pushed out his spear and flew to Kaula in Hamakua, Hawaii, the dividing line separating the districts of Hilo and Hamakua. From this place he continued on until he found Lupea, a sister of Hina, who was living above Kaawalii; she was one of Palila’s attendants. Lupea is a hau tree to this day, and wherever the malo of Palila was spread out to dry no hau tree has grown even to this day. This was caused by the god Ku, the god of Palila, a god of supernatural power. [ ] There was at Hilo a temple also called Humuula, like the one on Kauai, which was also sacred, and furthermore it was also under the control of the spirits and was just as powerful."
"O ke ’lii o Hilo ia wa, o Kulukulua, o Wanua ko Hamakua alii, e noho ana laua me ke kaua.

O neia mau koa ekolu, mahope o Wanua ke ’lii o Hamakua .","The king of Hilo at this time was Kulukulua, and Wanua was the king of Hamakua. The two were at war with each other. The greatest warrior of Hamakua was Moanonuikalehua and his war club was called Koholalele. This war club was so large that it required four hundred men to carry it. The next in greatness was Kumunuiaiake, a warrior of note. His spear was made from the mamane wood of Kawaihae; it was ten fathoms in length and he could throw this spear over a distance greater than the length of an ahupuaa . Puupuukaamai was another great warrior. His long pololu spear was made from the koaie wood, a very hard wood growing in the mountains. This spear was so long that it could be served as a wind break, and it could also be used to dam a stream; it could kill twelve hundred men at one stroke. All these three warriors were fighting on the side of Wanua, the king of Hamakua."
"O ka Palila hana i ka pali o Kaula, o ka olokaa ipu i ke alanui, me ka hele ole ma o a ma o, me ka ike o na mea a pau o ke alanui kona wahi noho.

Aka, ua lohe kekahi poe ma ka leo, i loko o ka hoouka poe ana o ke kaua, penei:","When Palila arrived at Kaula he took up the game of rolling the calabash which was played on the highway. He never once left the place and was known by everybody that passed along the highway as a man who did nothing else. In the battles that were being fought, a great many of the men of the army of Hamakua were being killed that no one could account for. This was carried on for many days and still no one could tell who was doing the killing. In the conflict, however, some of the men often heard a voice calling out:"
"A make na’u na Palila, Na kama a ka Walewale, Na ka hanai a Lupea, Na ka oo kani i ke kuahiwi nei la, Na ke ’kua ikaika na Ku.","Slain by me, Palila, By the offspring of Walewale, By the ward of Lupea, By the oo bird that sings in the forest, By the mighty god Ku."
"O ka leo wale no ke lohe ia, aole ke kino, no ka mama loa o Palila ma ka holo ana, nolaila, aole mea i ike ia ia, aka, ua nui ka noonoo o na kanaka nona, no ka pau loa i ka make.

The people had a suspicion, however, that it was Palila himself; but when the matter was discussed a good many said that it could not be Palila for he does not go to battle; all he did was to roll the calabash on the highway; he does not appear to be a soldier and he has not been seen going from place to place. At the battle that was fought at Kukaiau in Hamakua, Palila at last showed himself before the people and the chiefs of the two contesting armies, and also before the three great warriors Moanonuikalehua, Kumunuiaiake and Puupuukaamai."
"I ka hoouka ana o ke kaua, ua oi ka ikaika o na koa o Hamakua i ko Hilo, a ua nui ka make o Hilo i ko Hamakua. Ma keia hoouka ana ua lohe ia ka leo kaena a ua mau koa nei, e olelo ana: “Owai ko Hilo koa ikaika e ku mai e kaua.”",In the conflict it was seen that the soldiers in the Hamakua army were stronger than those in the Hilo army and a great many Hilo soldiers fell before the men of Hamakua. In the din and uproar the voices of the three great warriors were often heard boasting and calling out: “What great soldier will fight for the Hilo side?”
"A lohe o Palila i keia alelo kaena a ua poe koa nei, alaila, nonoi aku ia i ke ’lii o Hilo, ia Kulukulua, e waiho ke kaua aluka a me ka poe, a e ku pakahi. Ina i make ke [ ] koa o kekahi aoao, alaila, make kona alii a lilo i pio na kekahi aoao, a pela no hoi kekahi aoao. A hooholo ia ia mea e na ’lii, ku kaawale ae la na koa, a kaawale ke kahua kaua.","When Palila heard this boastful challenge from the three great warriors, he requested of Kulukulua, the Hilo king, to order that the general conflict be stopped and [ ] to put up the two best men from the two sides and let them fight, the side putting up the best man to win and in this way decide the battle. When this was agreed on by the two kings, the soldiers were lined up on the two sides, leaving a clear field in the middle for the contestants."
"Ku mai la o Moanonuikalehua me kana laau palau o Koholalele, a hookaa akau, aohe kupono ia Palila, hookaa hema, aohe kupono ia Palila, ia ia e hookaa ana, kaupale aku o Palila i kana laau o Huliamahi, loaa i ka Moanonuikalehua laau, lele i luna a haule i Waipio.

Pela i lanakila ai o Kulukulua, ko Hilo alii, maluna o Wanua ko Hamakua alii.","As soon as the field was cleared off Moanonuikalehua came forward with his war club, Koholalele, and began twirling it on the right and on the left; on each occasion Palila did not make a move, but as Moanonuikalehua kept on twirling, Palila held out his war club, Huliamahi, which struck the club of Moanonuikalehua, sending it flying to Waipio. At the same time Palila brought his club down and then up, catching the three warriors and killing them all. Palila then proceeded to cut out their lower jaws. After this was done he began the slaughter of the Hamakua men and allowed none to escape him. This victory made Kulukulua, the king of Hilo, master of Wanua, the king of Hamakua."
"A pau ke kaua, hoi aku la o Palila me ke ’lii a hiki i Kaula maluna aku, i laila he kumu ohia nui, o Kahakaauwae kona inoa, i laila na auwae a pau o na kanaka i make ia Palila ma na kaua mamua aku, o kahi ia e kau ai. Nolaila, lilo o Palila i alii no Hilo, a malalo o Kulukulua ona, pela i noho ai o Palila a hiki i ka make ana. [ ]","After the battle Palila and the king returned to Kaula and from there to a rise above where a large lehua tree was standing. He then hung up the jaws of all the men killed by him, and the tree was named Kahakaauwae, the hanging place of the jaws. Palila after this became the king of Hilo, while Kulukulua served under him. Palila was king until his death. [ ]"
"O Nuupia ka makuakane, o Halekou ka makuahine, o Puniakaia ke keiki, o Kaneohe ka aina; he mau alii na makua o Puniakaia, no Koolauloa, a me Koolaupoko.

Ma keia hanai ana a Puniakaia ia Uhumakaikai, a nui, alaila, hookuu hou ia i ka moana e noho ai.","Nuupia was the father and Halekou the mother of Puniakaia. The land of his birth was Kaneohe. The parents of Puniakaia were of the royal blood of Koolauloa and Koolaupoko. Puniakaia was a very handsome man and had not a single blemish from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet. He was erect, front and back, and so on the sides. While Puniakaia was living with his parents, a desire to go fishing came upon him, so he accompanied his mother to the beach and they went fishing. The kind of fish caught by them was the kind called pauhuuhu, but only one. This fish was brought home alive and was saved by Puniakaia; being fed and taken care of until it grew to be a very large fish; and to it was given the name of Uhumakaikai. This fish was the parent of all the fishes. After Puniakaia had brought up Uhumakaikai until it was full grown, he turned it into the ocean, free from all confinement."
"A mahope, kukala ia na mea a pau e hele i ka lawaia, a ma keia hele ana, o Puniakaia kekahi i hele, a hiki lakou i kahi e lawaia ai, ilaila o Puniakaia i kahea ai ia Uhumakaikai; penei ke kahea ana:","Some time after this a proclamation was issued calling everybody to go out fishing, and amongst those who obeyed the call was Puniakaia. When the fishermen arrived at the fishing place, Puniakaia called upon Uhumakaikai in the following manner:"
"E Uhumakaikai, E kolo mai, e kolo mai; E kolokolo mai; e kolokolo mai; Eia au la o Puniakaia! O ka ia no a nui loa, A ku ka pilau i uka nei! A ai ka puaa a haalele, Ai ka ilio a hoomaunauna.","Say, Uhumakaikai, Crawl this way, crawl this way, Draw along this way, draw along this way; For here am I, Puniakaia; Send the fish in large numbers Until the beach here is stenched; The pigs will eat until they reject them, And the dogs will eat until they waste them."
"A hooki o Puniakaia i ke kahea ana i ka ia, ia wa o Uhumakaikai i a mai ai i na ia a pau loa, mai lalo ka ia a luna o ka ilikai, o ia hele o ka ia a hiki i uka, a pae i kaha one. Ia manawa na kanaka i ohi ai i ka ia a kopi, a haawi, a pela aku, o na kanaka a pau loa mai ka lae o Makapuu a ka lae o Kaoio, ma Kualoa. Ma keia hele nui ana o na kanaka e ohi i ka ia, aole i pau no ka nui loa, a haalele okoa lakou i ka ia, a ai ka puaa me ka ilio. A ma keia lawaia ana, ua kui aku la ke kaulana a lohe o Kaalaea, he wahine maikai loa ia, aole ona lua ma Koolau a puni, ua like laua me Puniakaia, ke nana aku. [ ]","As soon as Puniakaia ceased calling, Uhumakaikai was seen to be driving all the fish to Puniakaia; the fish reached from way down deep in the sea to the surface, and they were driven clear up onto the sand. Upon seeing this the people began taking up the fish; some were salted, some given away to the people, and so on, from the Makapuu point to the Kaoio point at Kualoa. With all this great number of people taking the fish, still there was a large number left, there being so many; and the people had to leave a great many behind and the pigs and dogs ate of them. Rumors of this great catch were soon carried to the hearing of Kaalaea, a very beautiful woman, who had no equal in all the land of Koolau; she was just like Puniakaia [very pleasant] to look upon. [ ]"
"Holo aku la o Kaalaea, me kona mau kaikunane he umi, he umi lakou he umi waa, o ko Kaalaea waa, he umikumamakahi waa; a hiki lakou ma kahi o ka ia i pae ai, pae aku la na waa o lakou a uka, kau iho la, noho iho la o Kaalaea ma ka ae one maloo, me ka hele ole ma o a ma o, me ka noho malie e nana ana i na kanaka i ka ohi i ka ia, a me na wahine.","When the news of the great catch of fish came to Kaalaea, she and her ten brothers boarded their canoes, each taking one, making eleven canoes, and went to the place where the fish were being collected. When these canoes landed, Kaalaea went up on the sand and sat down and did not go about from place to place; but just looked on as the men and women helped themselves to the fish."
"Ia ia e noho ana ma laila, ike mai la o Puniakaia i ka wahine maikai o Kaalaea, i ka noho malie, i ka like ole me na wahine e ae, alaila, olelo aku la o Puniakaia i kona makuahine ia Halekou: “E Halekou e, e kii ana au i kela wahine na’u, no ka mea, he wahine maikai loa, aohe puu, aohe kee, ua like kona maikai me ko’u.” Ae mai o Halekou: “Ae, o kau wahine ia, ua like olua a elua, ua like na kino, na maikai, na nani, nolaila, e kii oe i wahine nau.”","While she was sitting there Puniakaia saw her and was captivated by her beauty and quiet demeanor, not at all like the other women; so he said to his mother, Halekou, “Say, Halekou, I am going to secure that woman for my own, because she is very beautiful, without blemish, and in all respects my equal.” Halekou gave her consent, saying: “Yes, she shall be your wife, for you two are alike in looks and behavior, therefore you go and ask her.”"
"A hiki o Puniakaia i mua o Kaalaea, olelo aku la i wahine nana, ae mai la no o Kaalaea; i aku no nae o Puniakaia ia Kaalaea: “E, i hele kaua a hiki i mua o ka makuahine o kaua, mai hilahila oe, hele no oe a noho i luna o na uha.” Hele aku la laua a hiki i mua o Halekou, noho iho la o Kaalaea i luna o na uha o Halekou, a liuliu iki, kena ae la o Halekou i na kanaka, e hooili i ka ia i na waa he umi, a pela na waa e ae; piha i ka waiwai, o keia waiwai, he waiwai hookupu na na mea a pau.

A pau ka hookupu ana, hoi aku la o Kaalaea i kona wahi me kona mau kaikunane a me kona mau makua.","When Puniakaia came to the presence of Kaalaea, he asked the woman that she become his wife. Kaalaea gave her consent to this. Puniakaia then said to her: “When we get to my mother, don’t be backward but go and sit on her lap.” When the two came to Halekou, Kaalaea went and sat on the lap of her future mother-in-law. After a little while Halekou ordered the men to load the ten canoes with fish, and this was done; not only the ten canoes but several others also were filled, and this property was distributed as gifts to the people. Halekou began to contribute gifts to Kaalaea, as was the custom of those days. Nuupia then did likewise, and then Puniakaia; those three brought offerings to Kaalaea. In giving the various gifts, great heaps of them, Kaalaea on her part gave only herself, still it exceeded that of all three. After the giving of gifts, Kaalaea returned to her place with her brothers and her parents."
"A hala lakou, nonoi aku o Puniakaia ia Halekou, e hoi me ka wahine me Kaalaea e noho ai. I mai o Halekou: “E kuu keiki, e hoolohe mai oe, e hele ana oe i ka hale o ko wahine e noho ai, e mainoino ana nae oe, a e hoi koke mai ana oe i anei, aole oe e liuliu aku.” A pau ka Halekou olelo ana, hele aku la ia i ko Kaalaea wahi, a noho pu iho la laua, he kane a he wahine.

Pela ka hana mau ana o na kaikoeke ia Puniakaia, a hala ka wa loihi, hookahi no hana a Puniakaia o ka hiamoe i na la a pau loa, me ka wahine me Kaalaea.","Sometime after this Puniakaia asked of his mother that he go and live with his wife. His mother replied: “My son, listen to what I have to say: You are going to the home of your wife to live, but you will be insulted and you will return here in a very short time.” After this Puniakaia went to the home of Kaalaea his wife, where they lived as husband and wife. At meal times it was customary with the brothers-in-law of Puniakaia to prepare the meal, then send for Puniakaia and make him sit on their lap while they fed him. This was carried on for some time; all Puniakaia did was to eat and sleep and never left his wife."
"I kekahi la, ia laua e moe ana, hele mai la, kekahi makuahine o Kaalaea, a me kekahi poe e ae, a hiki i kahi a laua nei e moe ana, e hele ana i ka lawaia papai.

These people were on their way to catch crabs. While in the house, the aunt said: “Wake up, Puniakaia, and let us go crabbing. What do you do, any way? Just sleep, and when you get up clean your eyes and catch flies and eat?” While the aunt was speaking, Puniakaia was listening through the soft mantle that covered them; the aunt did not know this, however, for she thought he was asleep."
"Aka, ua huhu loa o Puniakaia i keia lohe ana, nolaila, hookananuha loa iho la ia i kona mau kaikoeke, aole ekemu, aole hele pu e ai e like me mamua; nolaila, noonoo iho [ ] la na kaikoeke i ke kumu o keia hookananuha ana o ko lakou kaikoeke.

[ ] Because of this action of their brother-in-law they were very sad and pondered as to the reason of such action. Puniakaia, on the other hand, did nothing else but sleep day and night for over twenty days. Thinking that the matter would terminate seriously, the brothers-in-law of Puniakaia called the people together, men, women and children, and asked each and every one of them, who it was that had insulted their brother-in-law; but no one could answer the question. Failing in this Puniakaia was requested to tell them the person who had insulted him. Puniakaia then revealed the person’s name, saying: “The person who insulted me is the aunt of my wife, and not my wife. One day while we were in bed, the aunt with several others came into our house and said: ‘ Say, Puniakaia, get up and let us go crabbing, for what can you get by sleeping? Only to get up, clean your eyes, catch flies and eat?’ While she was speaking, I was lying down, but I could see and hear through our thin mantle. This is the reason why I am sad and unhappy.”"
"A lohe na kaikoeke, kena ae la e pepehi i ka makuahine, a make iho la ia, ia wa, o Puniakaia i hoi ai i kona wahi. A hiki aku la ia i mua o Halekou ka makuahine, ninau mai la o Halekou ia Puniakaia, hai aku la o Puniakaia i na mea a pau i hana ia nona i ka hale o ka wahine o Kaalaea. A lohe o Halekou, uwe iho la ia, a olelo aku: “He oiaio, ua olelo aku au ia oe, e mainoino ana oe i ka hale o ko wahine, a ike pono iho la oe.”","When the brothers-in-law heard this, they ordered that the aunt be put to death. After this order was carried out, Puniakaia returned to his own home. When he came in his mother’s presence, she asked him as to the reason of his return; he then told her everything relating to the treatment received by him while living with his wife. When Halekou heard this, she wept and said: “It is even as I said to you, that you were to be insulted in the home of your wife, and now you have seen it for yourself.”"
"He mau la i hala o ka noho ana, holo o Puniakaia i Kauai e makaikai ai, hele aku la ia a hiki i ka lae o Kaena ma Waianae, e noho ana keia poe e hoa i na waa, a e holo i Kauai. Ninau aku la o Puniakaia: “E holo ana ko oukou waa i hea?” “I Kauai.” “Aole la hoi e pono owau kekahi e holo pu me oukou?” “I ke aha hoi! O ka waa no paha ia.” O ke kumu o keia ae ana e holo pu i Kauai, o ka nana mai o lakou la a ike i ke kanaka maikai o Puniakaia.","After living with his mother for a few days, Puniakaia decided to go to Kauai to make a visit; so he started out until he came to the Kaena point, at Waianae, where he met some men who were lashing their canoe for a trip to Kauai. Puniakaia upon coming up to these men, asked them: “Where are you going with this canoe?” “To Kauai.” “Can I go with you?” “And why not? The canoe is yours.” The reason why these people allowed Puniakaia to go to Kauai with them was because he was such a handsome looking man."
"Ma keia holo ana, pae aku la lakou ma Wailua i Kauai, e noho ana i laila he wahine alii; makemake mai la i ke kanaka maikai o Puniakaia, hookuli mai la i ka waiwai, kii mai la i kane hoao maoli. Eia nae, he kane no ka ua wahine nei, he hanapilo, ma kekahi aoao no o Kauai kahi i noho ai.","On coming to Kauai they landed at Wailua, where a high chiefess was living. When she saw that Puniakaia was such a handsome looking man she began to give him presents of great value and after a while she even proposed that she become his wife. All this time, however, she had a husband already, who was then living at some distance on the other side of Kauai."
"Mahope o keia noho ana, iho aku la o Puniakaia i kahakai me ka wahine, aia hoi, e hoomakaukau ana kekahi mau kanaka e holo i ka lawaia. Ninau aku la o Puniakaia: “He aha ka olua lawaia?” Hai mai laua ala: “He lawaia oio, elua no nae kauna ke loaa mai, aohe mahuahua loa.” I aku o Puniakaia: “Ae, owau no ka mea e loaa ai ka ia, mai ka moana a ka honua, mai lalo a luna o ke kai, o ka ia, ohi ke kanaka a haalele, kopi a pilau, ai ka puaa me ka ilio, a e hoomaunauna.” Olelo mai na kanaka: “Wahahee oe; noho wale ae nei no makou i nei wahi aohe ia pela ke ku ana.” [ ]","Some time after Puniakaia had been living with this woman, he went down one day to the beach accompanied by the woman and there saw two men preparing to go out fishing. Upon coming up to the fishermen, Puniakaia asked them: “What kind of fishing are you two going out for?” The two replied: “Oio fishing; but the most we will ever catch will be about eight, not very many.” Puniakaia said: “Yes, I will be the one who will get you all you want, from the ocean to the land, from the bottom of the sea to the top and the people will not be able to carry away all the fish; they will salt some and the pigs and dogs will eat their full and a lot will be wasted.” The two men then said: “You are deceiving us. We have lived here all our lives and have never seen so much fish.” [ ]"
"Ma keia hoopaapaa o lakou, lohe aku la ke kane a ka wahine a ia nei, olelo mai la ia: “Pili ia aku.” Alaila, pili iho la lakou, olelo aku o Puniakaia: “E, aole e pili ana ko’u mau iwi i na waiwai lapuwale, eia wale no, he mau ahupuaa nunui eha, hookahi o kuu kua, hookahi o kuu alo, elua o na aoao.” Hooholo iho la lakou, he umikumamalima la, ina i ike ole ia ka ia i loko o ia mau la, alaila, eo o Puniakaia, ina hoi i ikeia, alaila, eo lakou la.","In this discussion the husband of the woman, who had accompanied Puniakaia to the beach heard it and so said: “Make a wager against him.” Wagers were then made; but Puniakaia said: “Say, I am not going to wager my bones against worthless articles. If I must wager my bones I want to wager them against four large pieces of land; one for my back; one for my front; and two for my sides.” This was acceptable, and fifteen days were allowed Puniakaia in which time he must catch the amount of fish boasted by him."
"Ma keia noho ana o Puniakaia, a hala he umikumamakahi la, eha la i koe, alaila eo. Ia wa, e makaukau ana kekahi waa e holo i Oahu nei, no Waianae kekahi mau mea, a no Kaumakapili kekahi. Olelo aku o Puniakaia: “E holo oukou a hiki i Waianae, a noho iho ko Waianae mau mea, hoi aku olua a hiki i Kaumakapili, pii aku olua a hiki i Nuuanu, nana aku olua i kai o Kaneohe, e hamama mai ana ka puka o kuu hale, hele aku olua a hiki, e noho ana kuu makuahine o Halekou. Olelo aku olua, i olelo mai nei ke keiki a olua ia maua, o Puniakaia ka inoa, ‘e hele oe a kahea i ka ia ana ia Uhumakaikai, e kolo aku i ka ia a hiki i Kauai, no ka mea, ekolu la i koe o ka pili ana, alaila, pau na la he umikumamalima, a i hiki ole ka ia i loko o ia mau la, alaila, make o Puniakaia i loko o ka umu.’ ”","After the agreement was made, Puniakaia lived on for eleven days without once making a move about catching any fish. On the eleventh day, however, he saw a canoe being prepared to sail for Oahu, manned by men from different districts of Oahu; some were from Waianae and some were from Kaumakapili. When Puniakaia saw this he said to the men: “When you get to Waianae, those who belong to that place remain there; then I wish you two who are going to Kaumakapili to go up Nuuanu and when you get there look down to Kaneohe. You will see my house with the door open. Go down to it and when you find my mother, Halekou, tell her that her son, Puniakaia, has sent her word to go and call his fish Uhumakaikai to urge forward the fish to Kauai, because in three days the time allowed him to catch a certain amount of fish would expire; and failing to get this fish he will be killed by being cooked in an umu.”"
"A pau ka olelo ana a Puniakaia, holo mai la ka waa o ua poe nei ia la, a ahiahi pae i Kou, ma keia holo ana, o Keaumiki a me Keauka, na hoa o Puniakaia kekahi i kokua i ka waa, ma keia holo ana mai, o ia ke kumu i pae koke ai i Oahu nei. A ko Waianae mau mea hoi, haalele laua i ka manao i ko laua aina, no ka mea, ua oi ko laua manao i ka Puniakaia olelo, a me ka makemake i kona kino, pela lakou a eha.","After Puniakaia had made this request the canoe set out and on the evening of the same day the canoe reached the harbor of Kou. On this voyage the friends of Puniakaia, Keaumiki and Keauka, assisted the canoe, hence its quick arrival. Also, the men who belonged to Waianae, knowing that the request was urgent, decided to continue on instead of stopping at their destination."
"A pae lakou ma Kou, haalele i ka waa malaila, a pii aku la a hiki i Nuuanu, nana aku la i kai o Kaneohe, e hamama mai ana ka waha o ka hale o Puniakaia.

The men then proceeded on down to the house and found Halekou the mother of Puniakaia sitting on some mats. The men extended their greetings and Halekou returned the same. Halekou then asked the men: “What has brought you here?” The men replied: “We have come on the request of a boy by the name of Puniakaia.” When Halekou heard this, she wept as well as the chiefs and common people, and said: “We thought that Puniakaia was dead; but we see now that he is still alive. What has he requested you to do?” “He told us that we come and tell you that you go and call for his fish, Uhumakaikai, and request that it drive some fish to Kauai; because Puniakaia made a wager with the king of Kauai, that in fifteen days he could catch a certain amount of fish, and that if this amount of fish was not caught within this given time, Puniakaia would be killed. Now this is the twelfth day and we have only three days left if Puniakaia is to be saved.” When Halekou heard this, she said: “I am afraid the fish will not obey my call; for he is the only one that could make the fish do his bidding; but I shall go and try.”"
"Haawi aku la o Halekou i ua poe nei, hookahi ahupuaa, hookahi hale kapa, hookahi hale ai, hookahi hale ia, hookahi hale moe, a loaa keia mau mea ia lakou, noho loa [ ] iho la lakou ilaila, me ka manao ole e hoi i ko lakou hale; hoohiki iho la lakou mamuli o Puniakaia a make lakou, me ko lakou haalele ole ia ia.","Because of this kind deed performed by these people, Halekou gave unto them a large piece of land, together with one house full of kapas, one house to eat in, one [ ] house for fish, and one house for them to sleep in. Upon receiving these gifts the men decided to live there and to abandon their old homes and at the same time they vowed that they would live and die serving Puniakaia."
"Hele aku la o Halekou me na ’lii a pau loa, a hiki i kahi o Uhumakaikai i hooholo ia ai, he kaheka ia, aia ma Nuupia e waiho nei a hiki i keia la. Kahea aku la o Halekou: “E kolo mai! E kolo mai!

This pool is at Nuupia to this day. Halekou then called out: “Draw along, draw along, draw along the fish, Uhumakaikai; from Kona and Koolau to Kauai where your master Puniakaia now is. Don’t be slow, don’t wait, else your master will be cooked in the umu.” At the close of this call, the sea was seen to be disturbed and Uhumakaikai passed below Halekou. She then took up the fish, kissed it and allowed it to go again. Halekou then said: “Make haste, else your master will die.”"
"O ka umikumamaha keia o na la; hookahi la i koe pau na la he umikumamalima, alaila, make o Puniakaia, no ka mea, ua makaukau ka umu, ka wahie, ke a, ke kauwawe.

O Puniakaia, ua hoi aku la ia me ka wahine o Kauai, a noho i ka lae kahakai, e kiai ana i kana ia, ia Uhumakaikai.","This was the fourteenth day and there was yet left but one day, when Puniakaia would be killed, for the umu, the wood, the stones and the covering were ready. On the approach of daylight the next day, the fish were seen coming to Kauai by way of Kona and by way of Koolau, until both schools met at Wailua. Puniakaia on this last day went down to the beach accompanied by the Kauai woman; and they went and sat on the seashore to wait for the arrival of Uhumakaikai."
"Ia laua i moe ai ia po, loaa ia Puniakaia ka moeuhane, e olelo mai ana penei: “Eia au o Uhumakaikai a hiki aku; no ke aha no la oe i haalele ai ia’u, a hele hookahi oe i ka aina malihini; aloha ole oe ia’u, ina aole au e lohe, make oe?” A pau ka moe ana, puoho ae la ia a hiaa iho la, me ka noonoo i ke ano o ka moe, mahope o keia noonoo ana, kau mai la ka halialia aloha ia ia o Uhumakaikai.","During the night, however, Puniakaia dreamed a dream in which he heard the remark: “Uhumakaikai is coming. Why did you leave me behind and go alone to a strange land? You do not love me. If I did not hear of your trouble, you would have been killed?” After he woke up he found that he had been dreaming so he became sleepless, wondering what the dream meant. After studying for some time a feeling of affection came upon him for Uhumakaikai."
"A hala ae la ka po, hiki mai la ka wehe ana o ka pawa o ke ao, oili ae la ia a waho o ka hale, nana aku la ia i ke kai, ua hele a ehu i ka ia, mai luna, a lalo. Ia wa, holo ana o Uhumakaikai malalo ona, lalau iho la ia a hii ae la, honi iho la, a kaukau iho: “U; aole au i manao e haalele ia oe, i hele mai au me kuu manao e makaikai ia Oahu a puni, alaila, hoi aku ia oe, eia ka au e hala ana i Kauai nei, nolaila, mai ike ole oe i ko’u puumake, e hiki ole mai nei oe, make au.”","After the night was spent and the dawn of the new day began to break, Puniakaia came out of the house and looked toward the sea, when he saw the surface as well as the lower portion of the sea brown with fish. Shortly after this Uhumakaikai passed below him; he then reached down, took it up and hugged and kissed it. Then he said: “Yes, I did not intend to leave you behind; I came with the idea of making a tour of sightseeing around Oahu, and then go back to you; but instead I came to Kauai and came near not being able to see you again. Had you failed me I would have been killed.”"
"Hookuu aku la o Puniakaia ia Uhumakaikai, ia wa, hiki mai la ka ia a ku i uka o Wailua, mai ke kai a ke one maloo, ka piha i ka ia, ia wa ike na mea a pau loa o Wailua, a me ke ’lii nana ka pili, a hooholo ae la ua eo ia Puniakaia.

[ ]","Puniakaia then released Uhumakaikai and the fish began to come ashore at Wailua. The fish covered the sand and extended some distance into the sea. The people of Wailua and the king who made the wager saw the fish and they agreed that Puniakaia had won. Puniakaia then gave the whole of Kauai to the owner of the canoe that had brought him to Kauai, who then became the king. Puniakaia and his Kauai queen then returned to Oahu. [ ]"
"He kanaka kaulana o Maniniholokuaua, i ka ikaika a me ka mama, no Molokai; aohe ona lua i ke amo i na ukana kaumaha loa, oia ka waa a me na mea e ae.

He was without equal in the carrying of great heavy objects such as canoes and other things. Keliimalolo on the other hand was the greatest runner on the island of Oahu, he being able to make five complete circuits of Oahu in one day; he had no equal on that island as a runner. Maniniholokuaua lived at Kaunakakai in Molokai, while his lizard grandmother lived in the uplands at a place called Kalamaula, in a large cave which served her as a dwelling place. It was Maniniholokuaua’s custom to steal and carry away to the cave all the canoes and other valuables from the strangers who landed at Kaunakakai."
"O Keliimalolo, no Oahu nei ia, holo aku ia me kona waa maikai me ka upena, a me ka ai, na pono a pau loa, a pae ma Kaunakahakai i Molokai.

As he landed the people of the place called out to him: “Say, Keliimalolo, bring your canoe and leave it in the canoe shed, otherwise it will be stolen by Maniniholokuaua, the boy who steals and carries away canoes.” Keliimalolo then replied: “How can he get away with my canoe, is he a fast runner?” With these words Keliimalolo went to a pool of water, disrobed, left his clothes on the edge of the pool and jumped in for a wash."
"Ku ana o Maniniholokuaua i ka waa, paipai ana i ka aoao o ka waa: “Ko’u waa! Ko’u waa! A make ko’u waa! A make ko’u waa!” I aku o Keliimalolo: “Uoki kuu waa, mai lawe oe, ea!

He then patted the sides of the canoe and said: “My canoe, my canoe. I will own this canoe, I will own this canoe.” Keliimalolo answered: “Leave my canoe alone; don’t take it. Leave my canoe alone; don’t take it.” While Keliimalolo was talking, Maniniholokuaua lifted the canoe on his back with everything it contained and ran off at great speed. Keliimalolo upon seeing this came out of the water and chased after the thief; but he was not able to catch up with Maniniholokuaua. As soon as Maniniholokuaua arrived at the cave, he called out: “Open up, O cave.” The cave opened and Maniniholokuaua entered with the canoe. As soon as he was within, he again called: “Close up, O cave,” and the mouth of the cave was closed. No sooner than this was done when Keliimalolo arrived on the outside of the cave and began feeling for an opening; but after hunting in vain he returned heavy hearted."

He wished to get a good runner. On this trip to Kauai he first landed at Mana; after he landed he carried his canoe ashore and went for a swim. Upon coming to the pool he disrobed and jumped in. Just as he got into the water, Kamaakamikioi and Kamaakauluohia arrived from Niihau. They were the sons of Halulu. These two men were noted for their fleetness and could make ten circuits of Kauai in one day. Being very swift they could run on land and sea and from the earth to the skies. They were greater runners than either Keliimalolo or Maniniholokuaua. As soon as they arrived at the pool they picked up the malo of Keliimalolo and ran away with it. Keliimalolo got out of the pool and started to chase the two to try and recover his malo; but he could not catch up with them. The two ran out onto the sea, on the surface, and when at some distance from the shore they stood and looked at Keliimalolo. Keliimalolo [ ] then called out to them, saying: “You two come ashore and let us be friends.” After the two had come ashore Keliimalolo said to them: “You two will be the means of restoring to me what I have lost.” He then related to them his trip to Molokai and how his canoe was stolen by Maniniholokuaua. After the two had listened to the narrative, they said to Keliimalolo: “You return to Oahu and in the nights of Kane, we will come. When you see two narrow pointed clouds hanging in the horizon make sure that the clouds are ourselves and we will come soon after that.” The two then asked Keliimalolo: “Let us all make a circuit of Kauai in one day.” This was consented to by Keliimalolo."
"I ke kakahiaka, hoomaka lakou e hele i ke kaapuni ia Kauai; hookahi puni o Kauai ia laua nei a hoi aku, e hele ana no o Keliimalolo i ke ahupuaa hookahi, hele hou laua nei a puni o Kauai, hoi hou aku, e hele ana o Keliimalolo i ka lua o ke Ahupuaa.

Kamaakamikioi and Kamaakauluohia soon made their first round and overtook Keliimalolo who was still in the course of finishing the first ahupuaa. The two made another round and again overtook Keliimalolo, who was in the second ahupuaa. They made ten rounds of the island of Kauai by evening of the same day; but Keliimalolo was not able to make one round. They were indeed great runners, having no equal. That night they retired together, and on the next morning Keliimalolo set out on his return to Oahu, where he awaited the arrival of his two friends."

They then boarded a double canoe and set out for Molokai. At dawn of that morning they arrived at Kaunakakai and carried their canoe ashore; at the place where Keliimalolo left his canoe on his previous visit. They then set out for the pool to take a bath. While the canoe was still in mid-ocean, Maniniholokuaua looked and saw a canoe approaching; so said to his grandmother, Kalamaula: “There is my canoe, there is my canoe.” Kalamaula replied: “You must not attempt to steal that canoe as I have a premonition that the sons of Halulu of Niihau are on that canoe. If they are on that canoe we will be killed. I have no regrets for myself for I am old; but I am sorry for you, for you are yet young.”"

When he got to the place where the canoe was lying, he patted the sides and said: “My canoe, my canoe.” Keliimalolo upon seeing Maniniholokuaua said to his friends: “There is the boy.” Keliimalolo then called out: “Leave my canoe alone; you must not take it.” Heedless of the call, Maniniholokuaua took up the canoe, placed it on his back and ran off at the top of his speed. Kamaakamikioi then said: “I am going after that fellow. If you see a fire burning, it is a sign that I have killed him; you may then come up.” As Maniniholokuaua was almost up to the cave, Kamaakamikioi caught up with him. Maniniholokuaua then called out: “Open up, O cave,” and Kamaakamikioi thereupon called out: “Close up, O cave.” No sooner than the cave was opened it immediately closed again catching Maniniholokuaua and the canoe in its jaws, killing Maniniholokuaua. Kamaakamikioi then called out: “Open up, O cave.” The cave opened and he entered in. He found Kalamaula and she was killed. When he looked about the cave he saw that it was filled with canoes of every description and many things of great value. He then went out of the cave to light the fire, and when the people saw it they all came up to the cave and carried away the valuables; but the people of the whole of Molokai were unable to carry away all of the things in the cave.

"O Kalauao i Ewa, kahi noho o Opelemoemoe. He kanaka hana kupanaha loa ia, aohe ona lua mamua aku ona, a mahope mai ona a hiki i keia mau la hope.

This man performed some very extraordinary things, things the like of which had not been seen before him nor since. He could keep asleep from the first day of the month to the end of the month; but if a thunder storm occurred he would then wake up; otherwise he would keep on sleeping for a whole year. If he should be walking along the road and should become sleepy, he would then sleep without once getting up, until it thundered, when he would get up and would stay awake for days and nights at a time, in summer and in winter. So would it be if he was out in the ocean; if he fell asleep, he would sleep in the sea until it thundered, when he would wake up. He was without equal in his extraordinary behavior."
"Hele aku la o Opelemoemoe mai Kalauao aku a Puuokapolei, oioi iho la, moe iho la ia i laila, kokoke e hala ke anahulu okoa, elua nae paha po i koe anahulu.

He slept for a period of nearly ten days; it perhaps lacked two days, when a couple of men arrived from Kauai, who were on their way in search of a human sacrifice for the temple of Lolomauna, at Pokii, Kauai. These men upon seeing Opelemoemoe tried to wake him up, but in this they were unsuccessful. They then carried him on their backs to Pokai, at which place their canoes were moored, placed him in the canoe and carried him off to Kauai. After landing they again carried Opelemoemoe and placed him on the altar in the temple of Lolomauna, together with a pig, some bananas, some coconuts and some awa. During all this time Opelemoemoe never once awoke from his sleep. It was noticed that his body did not decay like the rest of the things that were placed on the altar; for the bananas, the pig, the fish and the awa all rotted. Opelemoemoe was then left on the altar until one day it thundered, when he awoke and found himself tied hand and foot. He then untied himself and got down from the altar."
"Hele aku la ia a Waimea, moe wahine, noho iho la i laila, nonoi aku la i ka wahine i aina mahiai, haawi mai la ka wahine he mau kihapai; i aku o Opelemoemoe, haawi mai a nui ka aina i mahiai aku wau. Mahiai aku la o Opelemoemoe, he ao he po, pau ka aina i ka mahi, paa i ka ai.","From the temple he went off until he came to Waimea, where he married and settled down. One day he asked his wife for a piece of land to farm on; so the wife pointed out to him certain patches; at sight of the land Opelemoemoe asked that he be given some larger farm lands so that he could cultivate them. Upon getting the lands from his wife he began tilling both day and night until the lands were all cleared and planted."
"Moe iho la o Opelemoemoe, i aku i ka wahine ia Kalikookalauae: “Ke moe nei au, mai hoala oe i kuu hiamoe. I hiki mai ka makamaka o kaua, mai hoala oe; i hiki mai ka waiwai, mai hoala oe; i pilikia oe, mai hoala oe, mai noho oe a kaniuhu, hoala oe ia’u; he kapu kuu hiamoe.” Moe o Opelemoemoe a hala he anahulu, a hala hou he anahulu, olelo iho o Kalikookalauae: “Ka!

Ia ia i lalo o ke kai e moe ana, ua pau loa kona ili i ka ai ia e ka ia.","One day Opelemoemoe felt sleepy, and said to his wife, Kalikookalauae: “I am falling off to sleep, so don’t attempt to wake me up. If our friends should come don’t disturb me; if fortune should come do not awaken me; if you should be in danger, don’t arouse me; and don’t ever complain, but just leave me alone and don’t wake me up, for I have placed a kapu over it.” Opelemoemoe then fell off to sleep. This sleep was continued for ten days, and still another ten days. At this extraordinary length of time taken up in his sleep, Kalikookalauae said to herself: “How strange this is! I had no idea of the length of time you were going to sleep, but I see you sleep like a dead person.” She then tried to wake him up; she shook him, poured water in his eyes, made [ ] some noise and still he slept on. She then called for her brothers, Popoloau and Kawaikoi, and her servants Poo and Mahamaha, to come in. When they arrived she said: “The chief is dead; let us wrap him up and carry him off and cast him into the sea.” The brothers and men then did as they were told, and cast him into the sea. Opelemoemoe slept on as though he was on land, never once moving. In this sleep the fish came around and ate his skin."
"Ua hala he mau malama ka moe ana o Opelemoemoe ilalo o ke kai, me ka make ole.

When he looked about him, he saw that he was at the bottom of the sea, all wrapped up and bound with cords. He then sat up and began to untie himself, and after he was free from the cords he came to the surface and swam ashore. He had no skin, he was covered with sores and was unable to walk; so he crawled to a pig pen where he sat down; from this place he crawled to another house where a priest was living who gave him some medicine and treated him until he was well. He then went back to his wife and they lived on as formerly. After the lapse of certain periods of tens of days, his wife conceived a child."
"I loko o keia wa, olelo aku o Opelemoemoe : “E, ke hoi nei au i Oahu; eia ka’u kauoha ia oe, i hanau ae he keiki kane, kapa oe i kona inoa, o Kalelealuaka, a i manao e imi ae ia’u, eia ka maka la, he ihe.” Noho aku la ka wahine o Kalikookalauae , a hanau he keiki kane, kapa iho la i ka inoa o Kalelealuaka, hanai iho la a nui.

If you should give birth to a boy, give him the name of Kalelealuaka; and if after he grows up he expresses the desire to come in search of me let have this token, a spear.” The wife lived on by herself until she gave birth to a boy to whom she gave the name of Kalelealuaka. She brought him up until he was big. He was a great mischief-maker and would often urinate in the calabash of food and such other mischievous acts. Because of this, his step-father often punished him; when Kalelealuaka would run off to his mother crying and would demand of her that she tell him of his father. The mother would then tell him that he had no other father than the one who was living with them. As this was continued for some time the mother at last told him, saying: “Yes, you have a different father; he is in Kalauao, Oahu, in the district of Ewa, in the village of Kahuoi; his name is Opelemoemoe.” Kalikookalauae then handed Kalelealuaka the spear left by Opelemoemoe as the token by which he was to recognize his son."
"Haalele aku la o Kalelealuaka ia Kauai, holo mai la a pae ma Pokai, i Waianae, hele mai la mauka a Ewa, a Kalauao, hiki i Kahuoi.

[ ]","Kalelealuaka then left Kauai and set sail, first landing at Pokai, in Waianae, and from there proceeded overland to Kalauao, Ewa, and then to Kahuoi. When he came to the house which had been pointed to him as the home of Opelemoemoe, he found that he had gone out farming, so he continued on to the taro patches where he found Opelemoemoe planting taro. Kalelealuaka then stood on the edge of the patch and called out: “Say, your rows of taro are crooked.” Opelemoemoe then began to straighten out the rows, row after row; but the boy would call out the same thing. Finally Opelemoemoe said: “How strange this is! Here I have been doing this right along and my rows were never crooked, but today, they seem to have all gone crooked.” He thereupon quit working and went to the edge of the patch where Kalelealuaka was standing; when he got to the edge of the patch he said: “Whose offspring art thou?” “Your own.” “Mine by whom?” “Yours with Kalikookalauae. I am Kalelealuaka, your son of Kauai.” They thereupon returned to the house. [ ]"

He was also a great thinker. Kulepe was of Oahu and lived in the time when Peleioholani was king. Halakii was the wife of Peleioholani, and Kaneaiai was the name given to the king’s double canoe. Kulepe once upon a time set out from Oahu and landed at Kalaupapa in Molokai and proceeded to the first house seen by him, where he found the people eating with their heads bowed down, and who never looked up to see who the stranger was. Kulepe was hungry and this was the reason why he called at this house. After standing by the door for some time he looked in and then remarked:"
"Aloha mai la ka hoi ka mea ai A ko makou alii o Peleioholani, E hoonuuu, e nuu, e nuunuu iho ai, E noho iho ai i luna o na waa o Kaneaiai, Me kuu wahine o Halakii.","How fondly I now remember the food Of our king, Peleioholani, Of which I could greedily partake As I sat on the canoe, Kaneaiai, With my wife Halakii."
"I aku na kanaka o ka hale: “O kou alii ka o Peleioholani?” Ae aku o Kulepe: “Ae, oia ke ’lii o makou na koa. ”","At this the people without raising their heads said: “Is Peleioholani then your king?” “Yes,” answered Kulepe, and continuing he said: “He is the king and we are his soldiers.”"
"Kahea hou o Kulepe, oia wale iho no keia olelo nei, e ake ana o ke kahea ia mai e ai.","After a while Kulepe again called out: (He did this with the hope of being able to get the people to invite him to sit down with them and take some food, without asking outright for the food.)"
"E Molokai e, i luna ka hoe, Nana iho, ehuehu he pili ia, Uliuli iho he poo ia no ke kanaka.","Say, Molokai, raise up your paddles. When you look down, the darkness you see is pili grass, And the black things, the heads of the people."
"O keia mau olelo a Kulepe, no lakou la, i ka hoonuu i ka ai me ka ia, i ka miki o na lima i luna e wala ai i ka poi, i ka kuaehu o na pa i ka ia, i ka uliuli o na poo i ke kulou i lalo, i ka ai a hoe iho, pela kai nei mau olelo hoopilipili:","These words of Kulepe were meant for themselves, on account of the way they gormandized the food and fish; of the fingers dipping the poi and raising them aloft, while the dishes were loaded with fish, that only the dark color of the hair was manifest as their heads were bowed, and of their eating and then whistling. These were his words of comparison:"
"Oili iho la au, ku ana i ka one maka, Ku ana lakou la i ke one maloo, A ke one maloo wau, Ku ana lakou la i ka pohuehue, A oi hopo kela ui, Ike no wau i ka ane o, He mea aaka ka, ka lae, He mea mimino ka ihu, He mea hau ka piko.

While in youth there is no fear, I have, however, felt it in youth, That the forehead will tell of a sour temper, That the nose will tell of a dry temper, That the end of most things is usually made of the hau. [ ] As he poked into it I tore it off into strips like a pandanus leaf. The sound traveled to heaven like thunder, It shook the earth like an earthquake, It flew and hit a wave Like a flying-fish in its flight. I was thus seen by Kamanuiki, Eating in full disregard of the kapu like Keakahiwa. Beware there, within, for it is Kulepe, The man without fear, The one like unto Puhali in strength. By my name alone those in the uplands are fearful."
"Ma keia olelo pahapaha a Kulepe, kahea mai o loko o ka hale e ai, komo aku la o Kulepe ai iho la.

The fellow, however, had never lived with Peleioholani, neither was he a soldier. He had not even lived anywhere near the king; but through his great cunning he pretended that he had so as to get something to eat. He was indeed artful. Very few people in these islands can compare with him. [ ]"

It was he who caused the road from Kawaipapa to Kahalaoaka to be paved with smooth rocks, even to the forests of Oopuloa in Koolau, Maui. He also was the one who built the road of shells on Molokai. Lonoapii, a boy was the first-born; then came Piikea, a girl; then Kihawahine, another girl (who is now spoken of as the lizard god Kihawahine); then came Kihapiilani, the youngest, a boy; there being two boys and two girls. At the time of this narrative Lonoapii was the king of the whole of Maui; and Piikea was the wife of Umi, the king of Hawaii."

One day two calabashes of salted nehu were brought to Lonoapii, which he gave out to everybody except Kihapiilani. That being the only fish to be had, Kihapiilani reached over and took some out of the calabash. This action displeased Lonoapii so much that he took up the calabash and threw the fish and brine into the face of Kihapiilani. At this Kihapiilani rose up and went away from the place, accompanied only by his immediate attendant, until they came to Kula, where they made their home. They took to farming and planted eight large fields of potatoes, using but one load of tops to cover the whole area."
"Iho aku la o Kihapiilani i kahi o ke kahuna o Apuna hai aku la: “E!

Will you tell me the proper thing to do?” The priest replied: “I cannot do anything for you; but go you to Koolau, at Keanae, and there Kahoko will tell you what to do in the matter; tell him your story.” The priest then asked that, in case the insult were avenged he be given the land of Kula. Kihapiilani replied: “Yes, it shall be yours.”"
"A hiki o Kihapiilani i mua o Kahoko ma Keanae , i aku: “E!

Tell me what to do in the matter.” Kahoko replied: “I cannot do anything for you; but I will advise you what to do. Go on your way until you reach Kauwiki, where you will find Lanakila, who will instruct you what to do.” Kahoko asked that in case he should gain his object that he be given the land of Koolau. Kihapiilani replied: “It shall be yours.”"

Lanakila then said: “I am not able to carry out your desire; but I will advise you what to do in the matter. Here is a canoe; here are the men; there is Hawaii where the clouds are hanging over like a mantle; take that dark object as your guide and follow it.” Lanakila then in turn asked for the land of Hana. Kihapiilani replied: “Yes, it shall be yours.” [ ]"

From this last place he continued on his way as far as Lamakee, in Kaauhuhu, where he rested; from this place he went on to Laaumama , in Ohanaula, where he was taken in by a chief of that place, Kapuaikahi by name. After partaking of a well served meal he continued on to Waiaoopu in Halaula, where he took a drink, thence to Puaiole, in Aamakao, where he went in bathing; from this place he journeyed to Waikuaala, at which place he took another drink, then continued on to the cliffs of Kaenaokamakaohua, and on down the Pololu valley, pushing on to Honokane and to the cliffs of Kuukuunaakaiole, at which place his friends were afraid of the sharks; but Kihapiilani plunged into the sea, forcing his friends to follow, and together they swam around the inaccessible cliffs at this place. In swimming around these cliffs, Kihapiilani was but following the instructions given him by the priest Lanakila, to follow the dark object which he saw at sea."

On the next day they pushed on to Waipio and from there to Kapulena, in Hamakua, where they spent the night; from this place they continued on to Kaumoali, to Kaala, to Kaula and on to Laupahoehoe in Hilo, where they slept that night. He discovered that Umi and his wife Piikea were living here; arriving at the house he went in, and being unable to contain himself he wept copious tears. Upon seeing this Umi asked him: “Which one of us is related to you? Is it I, or is it her?” Kihapiilani replied: “It is your wife.” At this Piikea said: “I don’t understand you.” Kihapiilani said: “Lonoapii was the first, then came Piikea, then Kihawahine and then Kihapiilani. I am Kihapiilani, your youngest brother.” Piikea then fell upon him and wept, after which she ordered Umi to prepare food and meat and set them before his brother-in-law. He and his friends then sat down and ate till they were satisfied."
"Ninau mai o Umi: “Heaha ka huakai o ka hiki ana mai?” I aku o Kihapiilani: “He makaia, i kapi ia kuu maka i ke kai paakai e Lonoapii. Oia kuu mea i holo mai nei.” Ninau aku o Umi ia Piikea: “Pehea la keia olelo a ke ’lii?” I mai o Piikea: “E hooko aku no hoi paha, ua au mai la ka hoi keia i ke kai.” Kena ae la o Umi i na luna, e hele e olelo ma Hawaii a puni, e kalai ka waa, he mau anahulu i hala, oki ka waa. Holo i Maui, kapa ia keia holo ana o ka waa nui. Mai Kohala a Kauwiki i Maui ka moe a na waa, o ka maka mua o na waa i Kauwiki o ka hope i Kohala. Hoomoe palua ia na waa, maluna o laila na kanaka e hele ai, aohe holo, he alanui maoli iho la no ka waa.","Umi asked him: “What is the object of this journey that brings you here?” Kihapiilani replied: “I am seeking for some one to avenge me, for Lonoapii threw brine into my face. This is the cause of my coming here.” Umi then turned to Piikea and asked: “What are we to do regarding this request of the chief?” Piikea replied: “Fulfill it, since he has crossed the seas.” Umi then sent out his messengers to carry his orders around the island of Hawaii, that canoes be hewed out. After a number of ten-day periods, the work was finished and his army set sail for Maui. This voyage was known as the sailing of the numberless canoes. The sea from Kohala to Kauwiki was covered with canoes. When the first canoe reached Kauwiki the last canoe was still at Kohala. The canoes were then fastened together in twos and in this way the men walked instead of sailing for Maui, the canoes being a regular road."
"Aia me Umi, o Piimaiwaa he koa, he aikane na Umi, o Omaokamau alua aikane, o Koi, he keiki na Umi, he mau koa lakou no Umi. [ ]","In the army of Umi was a man by the name of Piimaiwaa who was a friend of Umi’s, as well as Omaokamau another friend, and also Koi an adopted son. These three men were Umi’s greatest warriors. [ ]"
"O Hoolae ke ’lii i luna o ka puu o Kauwiki, nana ke kii o Kawalakii; i ke ao kaua na koa maoli i luna o ka puu o Kauwiki, a po kukulu ua kii nei o Kawalakii ma ka aoao o ka puu, kahi e pii mai ai o lalo. He kii nui o Kawalakii, me he kanaka maoli la ke ano, me ka laau palau i ka lima, i ka wa e kukulu ia ai o ua kii nei i ka po, pii aku o Omaokamau me na koa i ka po, i nana aku ka hana e ku mai ana neia kanaka nui, makau no hoi, ekolu paha po i hana ai peia.","Hoolae, a chief who had charge of the fort on the top of the hill called Kauwiki, had a great wooden image hewed out, Kawalakii by name, and placed it at the top of the ladder leading to the top of the hill. In the day time his men fought from the top of the hill, and at night the wooden man was made to stand up. This wooden man was a huge thing and in appearance looked just like a man. He held a large war club in one hand. One night, as this image was stood in place, Omaokamau with a number of men under him climbed the hill; but when they came in sight of the wooden man they were frightened. This occurred perhaps three nights."
"O ua kii nei ke kumu pakele o luna o ka puu o Kauwiki, no ka manao ia he kanaka keia mea nui, ke ku mai i ka po, nolaila ka pii ole o na koa o Umi i ka po i luna. Nolaila, ninau aku o Piimaiwaa ia Omaokamau ma: “Pehea ua kanaka la ke ku mai, he huli no, he hoololi no i ka laau ma ka hema?” “Aole,” wahi a Omaokamau, “hookahi no aoao e ku ai me ka laau palau, ao’e hookaa.”","By means of this big wooden man those on top of the hill were for a time secured from attack, as the soldiers of Umi were afraid to climb the hill in the night. Piimaiwaa therefore questioned Omaokamau as follows: “How does the man stand? Does he turn around? Does he change his war club to the left hand?” “No,” said Omaokamau. “He faces but one way and holds his war club in the same hand always. He does not at all twirl his war club.”"
"Ia po iho, pii aku la o Piimaiwaa me kana laau palau a kokoke i ke kii, ia Kawalakii, e ku mai ana kela maluna mai e pii aku ana keia ma lalo aku nei me ka ia nei laau. He mau anana ke kowa ma waena o laua, hookaa o Piimaiwaa i kana laau, ia Heleleikukaemakuu, a pau ia, hookaa aoao a hualepo, oniu.

Ia wa, maopopo he kii hoopunipuni keia, i maluhia ka puu o Kauwiki i ka po.","That night Piimaiwaa took up his war club and proceeded on his way to the hill. After climbing it he at last came to the big man, Kawalakii. There the man stood right above him, but Piimaiwaa fearlessly climbed the ladder, and when he was within a few fathoms of the big man, he twirled his war club, Heleleikukaemakuu, first above, then sideways, then downwards and at last made a swinging motion. In all these motions the big man stood in one position and made no attempt to swing his war club. By this Piimaiwaa made sure it was but a wooden man. He therefore approached it and tapped it with his club, and sure enough it sounded like wood. Piimaiwaa then understood the reason why the wooden man was put at the head of the ladder at night; it was to secure peace and safety on the hill of Kauwiki during the night."
"O ka wa no ia i hee ai ka puu a me na ’lii, na koa, a holo aku la o Hoolae ke ’lii me ka mama loa, hahai aku la o Piimaiwaa, a loaa i ke kuahiwi o Haleakala, ma ka huli hikina o Maui, pepehi ia iho la a make. Hele aku la ke kaua ma Maui a puni, a loaa o Lonoapii i Waihee, kaua iho la a make ia Umi ma.","On this night the chiefs and the soldiers of Hoolae, the officer in charge of this fort, were slain, but some of them fled. Piimaiwaa followed Hoolae until he caught him on the eastern side of the mountain of Haleakala where he was killed. War was carried on in general all over Maui until finally Lonoapii was captured at Waihee and killed by the men of Umi."
"Ma keia kaua ana a Umi, a hee ai o Maui, haawi ae la o Umi i ka aina ia Kihapiilani kona kaikoeke, a noho iho la o Kihapiilani he ’lii no Maui ia wa. Nolaila, hana iho la ia i ke alanui mai Kawaipapa aku a komo i ka nahele o Oopuloa, me ke kipapa i ka pohaku. Pela no hoi ke ala i Molokai, he pupu ka pohaku o ia ala, kela mea liilii o loko o ke kai, e hana ia nei, nolaila, kaulana o Kihapiilani ma keia mau hana ana o ke alanui.","After the battle and the conquest of Maui, Umi, being the conqueror, gave the island over to Kihapiilani, his brother-in-law, and Kihapiilani took possession and became the king of Maui. It was in his reign that the roadway from Kawaipapa to the forests of Oopuloa was made and paved with smooth rocks. It was also in his reign that the road on Molokai was made and paved with shells instead of rocks. The name of Kihapiilani has therefore been made famous by these roads he built."
"A pono na aina a pau loa malalo o Kihapiilani, hoi aku la o Umi i Hawaii. Ua kapa ia keia holo ana a Umi o ka waa nui oia ka helu mua i olelo ia ma ke kuauhau o na mea kahiko o Hawaii nei.","After the settlement of all the lands under Kihapiilani was accomplished, Umi returned to Hawaii. The expedition by Umi was termed the expedition of numberless canoes, and is now known as one of the foremost events of ancient Hawaiian history."
Pela iho la ka pomaikai o ka noho pio ana o Kihapiilani i kona wa ilihune a me ka poino i ili aku maluna o Lonoapii. [ ],"This story gives an idea of the benefits that come to one who travels along patiently like Kihapiilani, and the evils that will surely follow the footsteps of those who act like Lonoapii. [ ]"
"O Keahuolu ka makuakane, o Lanihau ka makuahine, o Hiku ke keiki, o Kaumalumalu ka aina, o Kona ka moku, o Hawaii ka Mokupuni.

These people once lived in Kaumalumalu in the district of Kona, island of Hawaii. Hiku lived with his parents in the uplands of Kaumalumalu until he was grown up. He was of very handsome appearance and was very pleasant to look upon. After he was grown into manhood he left home one day and started down towards the lowlands with his sugar-cane arrow called Pua-ne. While he was engaged in the game of arrow-shooting with the boys he sent his arrow flying in the air and it went buzzing over the head of a bald-headed man, then over a sore-eyed man and then over a lame man, passing over three ahupuaa in its flight, until it dropped at the place where a young girl, by the name of Kawelu, was living. When the arrow struck the ground, Kawelu was sitting outside the house, so she ordered one of her attendants to bring the arrow to her; after she looked at it she hid it."
"He wahine opiopio puupaa maikai loa o Kawelu ke nana aku, aohe ona kina, he ’lii, e noho ana ia me kona kahu, o kona mau makua ma kahi e aku.","Kawelu was a young girl and was very beautiful. She was without blemish, and was of very high rank, being the daughter of a high chief who lived at some distance away. She was at this time living with her attendants."
"Hiki mai la o Hiku a ma waho o ka hale, ninau aku la: “E na ’lii e, aole anei olua i ike i kuu pua i lele mai nei a haule iho nei maanei iho nei?” “Aole,” wahi a Kawelu.

Wahi a Hiku: “Ina no wau i kahea aku i ka inoa o ka’u pua, e o mai no.” “O i ana,” pela mai o Kawelu. “Pua-ne, Pua-ne.” “O.” “A aia hoi paha la, ua huna olua i kuu pua.” Kahea mai o Kawelu ia Hiku: “Kiina mai ko pua.” Ia Hiku i kii ai i ka pua, lalau mai la o Kawelu a huki aku la ma ka lima.

I ke ono o ka la, hele o Kawelu e ai, ia wa i hoi ai o Hiku i kona wahi i uka o Kaumalumalu.","Hiku in his desire to find his arrow arrived at this place and asked of Kawelu if she had seen his arrow which he thought had fallen somewhere near her. “No,” said Kawelu. Hiku said: “I saw my arrow drop here.” “We have not seen your arrow,” replied Kawelu. Hiku then said: “If I call for my arrow by its name it would make answer.” “Please do so,” continued Kawelu. “Pua-ne, Pua-ne,” called out Hiku. “Yes,” answered the arrow. “There you are, you two have hidden my arrow.” Kawelu then called out to Hiku: “Come and get your arrow.” As Hiku reached for the arrow, Kawelu grabbed his hand and pulled him into the house. As Hiku entered, Kawelu ordered her attendant out, after which they plighted their vows. This was kept up for five days, when Hiku became very hungry, for Kawelu went and took her meals by herself without asking Hiku. On the sixth day, as Kawelu went out to the eating house to take some food, Hiku rose and went up to his home at Kaumalumalu."
"Ma keia hoi ana o Hiku, hele o Kawelu e ai a hoi mai, i nana aku ka hana aole o Hiku o loko o ka hale, huli ae la ia a nana i uka, e pii ana o Hiku i Puukuakahi.

Ia wa kau aku o Kawelu i kona aloha ia Hiku, penei:","When Kawelu came back after her meal she discovered that Hiku was not in the house, so she went out to look for him; as she came out of the house she saw him climbing the heights of Puukuakahi. Kawelu then started after him, calling her husband to come back; but Hiku refused to come back saying: “I will not return, for I was made to feel hungry in your house; go back.” When Kawelu reached the top of Puukuakahi, Hiku had reached the top of the heights of Puukuakolu, and this distance between them was maintained until Hiku had reached the heights of Puukuaumi and Kawelu on the heights of Puukuaiwa. At this place Hiku called out for the maile vines, the ie vines, the ohia trees and all the different kinds of vegetation to creep over and to grow up in the pathway behind him, thus closing the way to Kawelu. She, however, upon [ ] coming to the place where the different vines had tangled up her way, struggled on, tearing her pau and other garments and receiving scratches all over her body. At this Kawelu chanted her love to Hiku in the following lines:"
"Pii ana Hiku i ke kualono, E ka lala e kau kolo nei, Ua keekeehia e ka ua, Ua helelei ka pua i lalo, Ka pua malau a Kanaloa, Homai ana kekahi pua e kui ae i ko’u lei, Ka pua i walea ai maua; Ua walea oe e Hiku i ka ipo kuahine.","Hiku is climbing the heights, As the branches of the trees are hindering my way. It is being pressed down by the rain, The flowers have fallen down below, The flowers rejected by Kanaloa. Let me have some of the flowers that I may string me a wreath, The flowers that we two have indulged in; For you have indulged, Hiku, in the love of a sister."
"Uwe iho la o Kawelu me na waimaka e helelei ana, a hopu iho la i ka upe a ka ae la, kau hou aku la ia:","Kawelu wept bitter tears upon finding herself thus abandoned, and after a while again chanted:"
"Noho ana Kawelu i Hanakaumalu, Noho ana Kawelu i Hanakaumalu, Aheahe koolau wahine o lalo, Kui ana i ka pua o ke kou Ko’u hoa, ua lilo i hiiku i hiialo, No lalo ka hoi oe e ke hoa.","Kawelu shall henceforth live in Hanakaumalu, Kawelu shall henceforth live in Hanakaumalu, Where the koolau winds waft there below, Stringing the blossoms of the kou , For my companion hath now become my idol to be carried standing and at my breast, For I shall henceforth belong there below."
"Ma keia mele hope a Kawelu, ua pau kona manao uhai ia Hiku, eia ka mea i holo i kona manao, o ka hoi a kaawe, a iho i lalo me Milu e noho ai, e like me ka lalani hope o ke mele ana.","In this chant of Kawelu she voiced her intention of giving up the idea of again looking for Hiku, her lover, and of going home and strangling herself, and thereby go down to dwell with Milu in the under world, as in the last line of her plaint."
"Hoi aku la o Hiku a hiki i na makua, noho iho la me ke aloha i ka liula koili o Kona, oia o Kawelu, e manao ana a pau kona huhu hoi me Kawelu.","Hiku continued on his way until he arrived at his parents’, where he again lived with them. His love for the vanished twilight of Kona, Kawelu, however, kept growing stronger and ever stronger, until it was more than he could bear. He finally decided to return to Kawelu as soon as he could forget her ill treatment of him."
"Hoi aku la o Kawelu a hiki i ka hale, olelo aku la i na mea a pau: “E hiamoe ana au, mai hoala oukou i kuu hiamoe; mai komo mai kekahi ma ko’u wahi moe; mai hoohalulu, na’u no wau e ala ae.” Ma keia moe ana o Kawelu, ua kaawe oia a make iho la. A hala ka la a me ka po, nauki loa na mea a pau i ka moe loa o Kawelu, kii aku la wehe i ka puka, i nana aku ka hana, e lewalewa mai ana ke elelo, ua make loa.","Kawelu after voicing her intent returned home and said to her attendants: “I am going to sleep and I don’t want you to wake me up, nor to hear any disturbances. I shall awaken when I feel like it.” Upon entering the house she laid down as though to sleep and strangled herself to death. After a day and a night had gone by, the people began to grow restless about Kawelu, so they opened the door and entered the house. Upon looking at Kawelu they saw her tongue hanging out; she was quite dead."
"Uwe iho la lakou me ka kanikau i na la he nui; makena iho la na makaainana o Kona ia Kawelu, a hala ia, pii na kanaka i laau hale e waiho ai ke kino kupapau o Kawelu. Ma keia pii ana, hiki loa aku la kekahi kanaka ma kahi a na makua o Hiku e noho [ ] ana, ninau mai la: “E pii ana oe i hea?” “ I pii mai nei makou i laau hale no ke ’lii wahine o makou ua make.” “Owai ka inoa?” “O Kawelu.”","The people mourned for her many days, the people of Kona joining in, for they all loved Kawelu. After the time of mourning was ended the people went up to the mountains for timbers, for the purpose of building a house in which to place her corpse. While on this mission some of the people went up as far as the place where the parents of Hiku were living, and they were asked as to the object of their mission. They replied: [ ] “We have come for house timbers for our young chiefess, who is dead.” “What is her name?” “Kawelu.”"
"Hoi aku la ua kanaka ala, ala mai o Hiku a ninau mai i na makua: “Ea! Heaha ka oukou olelo ma waho nei me ke kanaka?” “Ua make o Kawelu, o ia kona kumu i pii mai nei i laau hale e waiho ai ke kino kupapau. Oia ka olelo a ua kanaka ala.” A lohe o Hiku, uwe iho la ia me ka waimaka, no ke aloha ia Kawelu. Ia wa, ninau aku la o Hiku i na makua, no ka pono o ke kii ana ia Kawelu. Olelo mai na makua: “ E hele oe a ke kahuna olelo aku.” Hele aku la o Hiku a hiki i ke kahuna, hai aku la i na mea a pau loa e pili ana no Kawelu. I mai ke kahuna: “E imi oe i kowali a nui, alaila, holo a ka moana, hookuu iho i lalo, no ka mea, ua lilo ko wahine ia Milu; malama o lealea na akua a pau i ke kowali, alaila loaa o Kawelu, a e hamo hoi oe ia oe i ke kukui pilau.”","The men then returned; while Hiku, who was lying down, rose and came to ask his parents, saying: “What were you talking about out there with those men?” “Kawelu is dead, and they came up here for timbers to build a house in which to place her dead body. That is what the men said.” When Hiku heard this he wept sorely, for he loved Kawelu. After a while Hiku asked his parents if he could go and get Kawelu; the parents replied: “Go to the priest and tell him your wish.” Hiku then rose and went to the priest and told him of his intention of going in search of Kawelu. To this the priest replied: “Go and get much kowali vine, then go out to mid-ocean and let down one end of the vine into the sea, for your wife is now in the possession of Milu. It is possible the spirits may all have a desire to take a ride on the swing, then you will be able to get Kawelu; but you must first rub yourself all over with old decayed kukui nut.”"
"Hana aku la o Hiku e like me na olelo a ke kahuna. Holo aku la me na waa a ka moana, hookuu i na kowali i lalo a pau loa, a o Hiku hoi ma kekahi kowali, lele ana i lalo, olelo aku o Hiku i ka poe o luna o na waa: “Ina i umeume au i ke kowali, alaila huki oukou.” Iho aku la o Hiku me na kowali a hiki i lalo, lele ana, ike mai la na mea a pau loa i ka lele o Hiku, lealea mai la; e noho ana o Kawelu me Milu. Kahea mai la na mea a pau loa: “Kahi akua pilau, kahi akua pilau.” Aka, ua makemake loa na mea a pau i ka lele o Hiku i ke kowali, a me kona olioli mele ana, penei:","Hiku did as he was instructed by the priest, and after collecting all the kowali vines he could get, he took a double canoe and paddled out to mid-ocean; he then lowered one of the kowali vines into the sea, and taking another vine he lowered himself down. Just as he was going over the side of the canoe he told the men: “When you feel a jerky motion, haul up the vine.” Hiku then lowered himself down and when he reached the lower world he began to swing himself on his vine. When the people of the lower world saw Hiku swinging himself back and forth, they all wanted to have a ride. Kawelu was by the side of Milu. The spirits then called out: “Say, you ill-smelling spirit,” but Hiku paid them no attention. The spirits were all anxious for a ride on the swing and were also taken with the chant Hiku was singing:"
"Ko’u kowali, Kamaliilii kowali ole, Haule iho i lalo papaakea ka okole.","I have a swing, While the rest of you children have none; When you fall, it is only to sit on your behind."
"Ma keia mau hana a Hiku, kau mai la na mea a pau i ke kowali a me Milu kekahi, a lele aku la, a koe o Kawelu aohe ona kowali e lele ai. Kahea aku o Hiku: “Eia ko kaua kowali e lele ai.” Hoole mai o Kawelu: “Aole au e lele me oe, he pilau oe.” I aku Hiku: “Pale ae no hoi paha wau i kahi kapa, a kau iho no hoi oe maluna o’u.” Ma keia olelo a Hiku, lele mai la o Kawelu a kau pu me Hiku i luna o ke kowali hookahi a lele aku la.

[ ]","By these actions of Hiku they all jumped on the vine and began swinging back and forth. Milu could not keep himself away, so he too took a ride, leaving Kawelu all by herself. Hiku on seeing this invited Kawelu saying: “Here is our swing, come and ride with me.” “I will not ride with you for you smell bad.” Hiku replied: “I will cover myself over with my mantle and you can sit on me.” At this Kawelu consented and she jumped and sat on Hiku, and they began to swing back and forth. While Kawelu was enjoying herself, Hiku pulled on the vine, so those on the canoe began to haul it up. Just as they were about to reach the surface Hiku held on to Kawelu very tightly and held her so until they got into the canoe, and from there on to the house."
"A hiki i kahi i waiho ai ke kino kupapau o Kawelu, hoo aku la o Hiku i ka uhane o Kawelu ma na wawae, komo aku la a na kuli, hoi hou, no ka makau i ka pilau o ke kino. Pela o Hiku i hana ai a hala he mau la, komo ka uhane a loko o ke kino, a ka umauma, a ka puu, o o moa ae la o Kawelu.","When they reached the house where the dead body of Kawelu was lying, Hiku pushed the spirit of Kawelu into the body from the feet. After the spirit had gone as far as the knees, it came back as it was afraid of the body for it was decaying. Hiku, [ ] however, kept on urging the spirit up into the body, and he did this for some days until it finally entered the body, then on to the breast, then to the throat and at last Kawelu crowed like a rooster. After this she was taken up and warmed until Kawelu was restored to life and was again herself."
"Mahope o laila, puholoholo iho la a ola ae la o Kawelu, a hoi no e like me mamua, a noho iho la laua he kane a he wahine.",The two from this time on again took up their thread of life where they had left it and lived on as husband and wife. [ ]
