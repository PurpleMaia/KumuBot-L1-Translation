Here is your food and meat; it is a laukahi. This leaf is wholesome; as soon as you touch it to your lips your hunger is satisfied; and when satisfied you can go without eating for a period of four months.\u201d The grandmother then took up an axe and a knife and put them into the box. The lizard next cut off its tail and gave it to the grandson, saying: \u201cThis is my real body, which you must take with you. Here are also my pau of feathers and my feather kahili which shall act as your preserver when you meet your cousin. With these things in your possession\u2014that is, by wearing the pau and holding this kahili you will cause your enemies to fall and turn into ashes.\u201d The lizard then explained the uses of all the different things to her grandson, and she also taught him how to preserve these things of magic; but she did not tell him the name of the cousin.
