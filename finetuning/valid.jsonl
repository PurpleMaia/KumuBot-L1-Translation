As Aukelenuiaiku was falling down the pit, the angry brother called out: “Say, Kamooinanea, here is your food; eat him up.” While he was calling, one of his younger brothers, a kind one, came up running and called down the pit, saying: “Say, Kamooinanea, don’t eat him up, for he is your own grandson, Aukelenuiaiku, that is being thrown down.” After Aukelenuiaiku had fallen into the pit his older brothers were much pleased, believing that they had now gotten rid of him; that he was really dead; and their father’s promise on him would be unfulfilled, and become utterly void."}]}

What are you going to pay me for coming here? Because you have been given to me to be killed and that I should devour you, but since I have found out that you are one of those that have gone out of my own body, I cannot eat you up.” When the lizard concluded, Aukelenuiaiku gave his consent, for he thought within himself that the request of his lizard grandmother, Kamooinanea, should be granted. He then gave one of the men to the lizard. As soon as the man was offered, he was swallowed whole. After this first man was consumed the lizard again asked that the second man be given her. Aukelenuiaiku again gave the second man, and he too was swallowed whole. After the second man was consumed there was left only Aukelenuiaiku. The lizard then came out of the sea and laid on the dry sand."}]}
