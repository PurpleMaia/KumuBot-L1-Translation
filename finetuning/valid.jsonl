But on the other hand, if you beat me, I will not be able to keep the stakes away from you for you are too many for me, you can take the stakes away from me anyhow.” There was nothing wrong in this, so it was agreed, and the fish were handed over to Kuapakaa.

After we had sailed off and while outside of Waimea, Kauai, I uncovered Laamaomao and immediately we were encompassed by a great and terrible storm. In the midst of this storm, I gave out the palm leaves to the men, all with the exception of Hookeleihilo and Hookeleipuna. The food also was not given them, nor the meat and water; and being exhausted, the two died. We then left Kauai and set sail for Hawaii while all the people were asleep, and after a time we landed at Kawaihae, where I was neglected by my master and his men. Some time shortly after this I got into a race with some of the king’s men whom I defeated and they were put to death. After the men were put to death I told the king of you and me, and he sent me to bring you; therefore, I have come for you to go back with me.” At this Pakaa asked: “What has your master given you?” “Nothing.” “Then go back and tell your master that Pakaa has sent word that until the king has restored all the lands taken back by him, as well as all the other things, I will not come back. Restore these things and I will come.”"}]}

A hook with a stone attached forming the bait are the things that catch it. When fishing, chew the kukui [nuts] and blow it on the sea to calm it whereby the bottom is made clear, and when the squid is located the hook is let down. There are several varieties of this fish (the squid), and it has a body which it can transform in various ways; that is why the kukui is blown over the sea, to calm it and [permit] the squid [to be] plainly seen. Here are the different forms of the squid at different times: In the morning the form resembles that of breadfruit, that is, the skin. Toward noon it is red. In the afternoon it is brown, similar to seaweed. In the evening it is dark like the coral. All squid, both large and small, change in the same way. Therefore those who are not learned in discerning the squid are not fit to go out on this kind of fishing."}]}
