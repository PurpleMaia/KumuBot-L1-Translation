  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair.",
  "mistral-Small-3.1-24B-ud-q4kxl-maui_translation": "<translation>\nBecause Pikoiakaalala was very hungry, he went out from the human settlement to look for food, and he returned with his sisters, having caught a pig and food. Before starting to eat, Pikoiakaalala said: \"Listen to me all, this is my law for eating: No talking, no arguing, no laughing, no sneezing, no farting, and all my eating will be completed.\" He called the pig, one roasted portion, the sweet potato, one helping, and more, and again, the whole pig was finished, along with all the food from the oven. One person said: \"This is food from the gods.\" That was right. The old men said: \"But will the return be like the eating?\" \"No, it will be full.\" \"Yes, we have heard your law,\" said the old men. Through this eating of Pikoiakaalala, his body grew large and good, but his hair was the hair of a pig.\n</translation>"
