  "mistral-Small-3.1-24B-ud-q4kxl-maui_translation": "The provided Hawaiian text appears to be a traditional or cultural poem or chant, which can be quite complex to translate directly into English due to its poetic and cultural nuances. However, I can provide a literal translation of the text to the best of my ability. Here is a possible interpretation:\n\n<translation>\nThe finely woven land of Kohala,\n\nI count one bundle,\n\nAnd six bundles from me,\n\nThe first bundle of the anchor,\n\nThe second bundle of the crossbar,\n\nThe third bundle of the beam,\n\nThe fourth bundle of the timber,\n\nThe fifth bundle of the trunk,\n\nThe sixth bundle of the pattern,\n\nThe bundle on the mountain peak.\n</translation>\n\nPlease note that this translation attempts to capture the literal meaning of the words but may not fully convey the poetic and cultural significance of the original Hawaiian text. For a more accurate and culturally sensitive translation, consulting a specialist in Hawaiian language and culture would be advisable."
