  "reference_translation": "When Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui woke up in the morning and went out of doors, they saw a wooden dagger sticking in the ground just outside of the entrance. At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”",
