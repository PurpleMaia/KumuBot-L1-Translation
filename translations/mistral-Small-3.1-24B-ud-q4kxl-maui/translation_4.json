  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",

However, I can provide a literal translation based on the words and phrases given. Here is the translation:\n\n<translation>\nAt midnight, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. Here is the reason. The mother looked at the daughter and replied: “Yes, we are the return of the beloved of the flesh and blood, not the beloved of the flesh and blood of your father.” Pumaia said: “What is the matter with you two?” “No, we are just talking about death, not about you, the one not of flesh and blood.” Pumaia said to the woman: “Let us go; separate from me and take it.” They went from Pukoula to the slope of Pauoa and then to the water of Alekoki, and then to Maemae, and they walked until the vast sea was visible at dawn, and they reached Nuuanu.\n</translation>"
