  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",
  "mistral-Small-3.1-24B-ud-q4kxl-maui_translation": "Sure, here is the translation of the Hawaiian text to English:\n\n<translation>\nMakiioeoe was the father, Hina the mother (Kuaihelani was Makiioeoe’s land; she was the chief there, a woman who resided in Kuaihelani, with one child, a woman, and her name was Kahikiula). Hina was from Kauai, and that is where Laukiamanuikahiki was found. Makiioeoe came from Kuaihelani to Kauai, and Hina took him in; they slept together, and Hina became pregnant. At that time, Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani and said to Hina: “I am returning; you will stay and give birth to a boy, and you will name him after me; and if you give birth to a girl, you will name her Laukiamanuikahiki. Raise her well, and think that she will come to seek me out; here are the signs, a lei of dogtooth tusk shells, a kupee (a type of pendant), an ahuula (a feathered cloak), a large canoe, a small canoe, a large person, a small person, a canoe with red paddles, red feathers, red 'ulaula shells, anything red, a red person.” Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani, with the words about the signs of the girl child, and the planting of all the things for Laukiamanuikahiki, the kiowai (a type of vine) and other things as well, taboo and sacred was Laukiamanuikahiki.\n</translation>"
