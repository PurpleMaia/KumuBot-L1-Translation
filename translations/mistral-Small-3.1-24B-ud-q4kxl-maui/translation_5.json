  "reference_translation": "This call and reply was repeated twice before the guards heard it, when they sat up and listened to the call and they understood the meaning conveyed by the owl in its call. At this one of the guards said to his companion: “Say, this must be Laukiamanuikahiki, the king’s own daughter.” The other replied: “No, this cannot be the one, for she was to come in a red canoe having red sails, red paddles, red men, a large canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men; these I understand are the things that should accompany her; this girl on the other hand is a poor girl for she has come without any of these things.” The two again listened to the conversation between the owl and girl. After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter. They arrived at the home of Makiioeoe after midnight and roused him up saying: “Say, you wake up.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “There is an owl right over the pig house where the girl is held who called out to the girl in the following way:",
