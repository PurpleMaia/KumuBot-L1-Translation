  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "Then, he took his mother and hid her in the cavity of Waipouli. When his mother was lost (or hidden), they returned to their house in Keahumoa and remained there. Nāmakaokapāo'o then climbed up onto the floor of the house, opened the mat covering his back and face, and lay himself down in the middle, resting atop the floor of the house.",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Then, he took his mother and hid her in the cavity of Waipouli. When his mother was lost (or hidden), they returned to their house in Keahumoa and remained there. Nāmakaokapāo'o then climbed up onto the floor of the house, opened the mat covering his back and face, and lay himself down in the middle, resting atop the floor of the house.</translation>\n\n<commentary>• Paragraph 11 narrates a scene of concealment and rest within a traditional Hawaiian setting, emphasizing familial bonds and cultural practices of hiding or safeguarding loved ones in times of danger or secrecy. \n• The act of \"hūnā ma ke ana\" (hidden in the cavity) is significant in Hawaiian culture, symbolizing concealment, protection, or strategic retreat, often linked to spiritual or social concealment during times of turmoil or ritual.\n• Waipouli (literally, \"water fairy\" or \"water spirit\") likely references a specific locale or a symbolic space representing sacredness, concealment, or spiritual significance, echoing Hawaiian landscape and mythic geography.\n• The phrase \"nalo ka makuahine\" (the mother was lost or hidden) can be interpreted both literally and metaphorically: literally, the mother is concealed within the natural or spiritual landscape; metaphorically, it symbolizes her withdrawal from danger or her transition into a protected state.\n• Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions—carrying his mother away, returning to their home in Keahumoa (the \"long plain\" or perhaps a metaphor for a safe refuge)—stresses themes of familial loyalty and strategic movement, critical in traditional Hawaiian storytelling.\n• The imagery of climbing onto the \"kaupoku o ka hale\" (floor of the house) and exposing the \"mau'u\" (mat) covering the back and face indicates a ritual or symbolic act, possibly related to spiritual protection, privacy, or a customary practice of resting in a manner that preserves spiritual or cultural privacy, especially during times of crisis or spiritual significance.\n• The act of lying \"ma luna pono o ke kaupoku\" (firmly in the middle on the floor) may symbolize a state of temporary safety, spiritual grounding, and readiness, echoing the importance of the physical and spiritual space within the Hawaiian hale (house) as a sanctuary in storytelling and oral tradition. \n• Contextually, this scene depicts a moment of familial cohesion amidst potential peril, illustrating Hawaiian values of caring for family, respecting sacred spaces, and the metaphorical importance of land and home as places of refuge and spiritual strength.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
