  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the land in ‘Ewa; there they (two individuals) engaged intimately, and through that union, Nāmakaokapāoʻo was born. Pōka‘ī lifted Nāmakaokapāoʻo, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land. Pōka‘ī sat with his child, and later, a birth occurred. From this birth, both Pōka‘ī and his child Nāmakaokapāoʻo were very impoverished.",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "• Allegorical Reading of Characters and Events\n  – The passage depicts a mythic origin scene involving divine or semi-divine figures linking to the land and ancestors.\n  – Hō‘ae‘ae, as the land in ‘Ewa, functions both as a geographic place and a symbolic cradle of kinship and divine lineage.\n  – The union (\"launa kino\") suggests a sacred or foundational relationship, emphasizing the integral connection between land (Hō‘ae‘ae) and ancestral power.\n\n• Symbolism of Name and Characters\n  – Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s name stems from 'Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo', meaning \"the eyes of the pāoʻo\" (possibly metaphorical for vigilance or divine oversight). The ‘pāoʻo’ bird or element may symbolize spiritual or ancestral watchfulness.\n  – Pōka‘ī, likely representing a figure of nobility or higher status, signifies an ancestral or chiefly authority, as \"Pō\" often connotes darkness or sacredness, and \"ka‘i\" can imply lifting or elevation.\n  – Kauluakaha‘i, with \"ka ulu\" meaning \"the head\" and “akaha‘i” possibly linked to cleared or open space, might symbolize a return to or a connection with land or origins.\n\n• Cultural and Historical Context\n  – The narrative appears rooted in oral traditions recounting divine genealogies, possibly from the Ai Kapu era, emphasizing genealogy, land, and divine authority (though the story shows signs of post-contact influence with the mention of impoverishment and struggle).\n  – The mention of impoverishment (\"ilihune loa\") after the birth reflects a recurring theme in Hawaiian storytelling—links between divine origin stories and the hardships faced by descendants, possibly alluding to the disrupted social order following contact and western influence.\n  – The scene’s imagery of land and progeny echoes traditional Hawaiian concepts of *‘ohana* (family) and *‘āina* (land as mother/father), illustrating foundational myths about the origins of chiefly lines and land tenure.\n\n• Possible Social or Cultural Critique\n  – The narrative might subtly critique the fate of noble or divine lines, highlighting how, despite divine origins, descendants often faced hardship—an allegory for the diminishing of traditional authority post-1820s, during the Missionary period, and the social upheavals thereafter.\n  – The emphasis on poverty (\"ilihune loa\") in the aftermath of divine birth could symbolize the spiritual and material loss experienced during colonial contact, land dispossession, or cultural erosion.\n\n• Overall, the passage encapsulates Hawaiian mythic themes of divine genealogy, land connection, and the intertwining of spiritual authority with earthly struggles, reflecting both reverence for ancestors and awareness of historical disruptions.",

When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
