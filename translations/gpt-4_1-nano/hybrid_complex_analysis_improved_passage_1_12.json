  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "Hawai'i chief Ama'u sent messengers from Waikīkī, four warriors, in each group totaling one hundred and twenty-eight men, thus all four groups had the same number. They arrived at Keahumoa’s schoolhouse, entered the house, and no one was there. Preparing to return, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from the top of the kaupoku (elevated platform). They heard the voice but could not see the body, and asked: \"Where are you calling from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o responded: \"Here I am above.\" Then eight men climbed up, four behind the house and four in front of the house near Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o asked: \"Why are you coming here to fight?\" They replied: \"We came to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o because he is a small child like you, yet he is strong and brave—he killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nHawai'i chief Ama'u sent messengers from Waikīkī, four warriors, in each group totaling one hundred and twenty-eight men, thus all four groups had the same number. They arrived at Keahumoa’s schoolhouse, entered the house, and no one was there. Preparing to return, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from the top of the kaupoku (elevated platform).

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
