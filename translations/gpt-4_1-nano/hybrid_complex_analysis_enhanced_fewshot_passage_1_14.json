  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "Hearing of Ama'u, he prepared his eighteen war canoes, and he set out to sea from Ewa to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When Ama'u and his group arrived in Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o was in the midst of a complete destruction, with no one alive, and Ama'u was killed. O'ahu then became entirely filled with Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then Ama'u's spirit returned and told his mother, and she returned to settle upon the land of O'ahu.",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nHearing of Ama'u, he prepared his eighteen war canoes, and he set out to sea from Ewa to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When Ama'u and his group arrived in Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o was in the midst of a complete destruction, with no one alive, and Ama'u was killed. O'ahu then became entirely filled with Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then Ama'u's spirit returned and told his mother, and she returned to settle upon the land of O'ahu.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• Paragraph 14 encapsulates a legendary battle involving Ama'u, a figure likely emblematic of a formidable chief or hero, and Nāmakaokapāo'o, a powerful entity or divine figure associated with strength and destruction. • The narrative opens with Ama'u preparing eighteen war canoes ('umi kumamāwalu), which signifies a full fleet, appropriate for a major wartime expedition. Eighteen is a culturally significant number in Hawaiian warfare, representing readiness and formidable force; the setting at Ewa situates the scene geographically on O'ahu's western coast, a known strategic area. • The detailed journey from Ewa underscores the customary practice of warfare expeditions launched across island regions, reflecting inter-polity conflicts and alliances. • Nāmakaokapāo'o's destructive act, \"luku ā pau loa,\" indicates a fierce, perhaps divine or supernatural, obliteration that leaves no survivors, emphasizing her or its unstoppable power. Nāmakaokapāo'o, often associated with water—particularly the deity of the sea or a goddess of destruction—symbolizes natural or divine forces capable of overwhelming human efforts. • Ama'u's death signifies the loss of a formidable leader or hero, whose defeat aligns with traditional narratives of heroism and the consequences of warfare. • The phrase \"puni a'ela 'o O'ahu nei iā Nāmakaokapāo'o\" indicates O'ahu's domination or being filled with Nāmakaokapāo'o, which poetically suggests her influence or control over the land, possibly reflecting natural calamities or divine retribution. • The return of Ama'u's spirit ('i ki'i akula ia i kona makuahine) and her subsequent settling on O'ahu echo the ancestral and spiritual processes integral to Hawaiian worldview—where spirits of heroes and chiefs influence land and people beyond physical death, reinforcing the cyclical and spiritual nature of Hawaiian cosmology. • This narrative may allegorically depict the ongoing struggles between mortal warriors and divine or elemental forces, embodying themes of destruction, resilience, and ancestral presence. • The story aligns with traditional Hawaiian themes of heroism, divine intervention, and the spiritual significance of land, highlighting how mythic battles serve as metaphors for natural forces and societal values regarding bravery, authority, and the sacredness of land.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
