  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "While they were sitting, Puali‘i, a good man from Līhu‘e who was fishing at Honouliuli, came to Pōka‘ī’s house. Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and desired her, and he said: \"I want you to be my wife.\" Pōka‘ī replied: \"How can you want me? I have borne a child, and my body is hurt.\" Puali‘i said: \"Those are nothing matters; since you wish me, let us sleep together.\" Pōka‘ī agreed. Then Pōka‘ī and her husband, along with Puali‘i, sat down at Keahumoa's school (or place).",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "• Allegorical theme of desire and social conflict:  \n  – The narrative depicts a person from Līhu‘e (connected with a well-regarded district of Kaua‘i) visiting Pōka‘ī, indicating a common story motif where outsiders bring challenges or desires that test social bonds.  \n  – Puali‘i’s desire for Pōka‘ī signifies external influences or temptations entering traditional Hawaiian social structures.\n\n• Cultural symbolism in personal relationships:\n  – Pōka‘ī’s refusal to accept Puali‘i’s advances because she bears a child and is injured suggests an allegory for wounded status or loss of mana (spiritual authority and social standing), possibly reflecting the societal upheaval from earlier periods such as the Ai Kapu era or after the 1819 abolition of the kapu system.  \n  – Her willingness to finally sleep with Puali‘i upon his insistence can symbolize societal pressures or the abdication of traditional taboos.\n\n• Names and their meanings:  \n  – Puali‘i (from \"pua-lī‘i\" potentially meaning \"flower of honor\" or \"flower of rank\") may symbolize noble or high-ranking individuals whose desires threaten social harmony.  \n  – Pōka‘ī (from “pō” = night, darkness; “ka‘ī” = My own or perhaps ‘the chief’) could represent a traditional figure, possibly a woman of standing or a symbol of the native social order.  \n  – Keahumoa (name derived from “kea” = white, “humoa” = to knead or to press) — possibly a place associated with learning (literally “the white kneading” or “pressing place”), hinting at education or transformation.\n\n• The setting at \"Keahumoa\" and reference to \"kula\" (field) and \"hālau\" (school) bears significance:\n  – It connects the narrative to traditional social and educational institutions.  \n  – The mention of sitting at Keahumoa’s school could symbolize a site of cultural transmission or social negotiation, especially post-1820 when missionary influence was beginning to reshape Hawaiian education.\n\n• Historical context and social commentary:\n  – The narrative subtly reflects the social dynamics during the decline of the kapu system and the increasing influence of Western contact and Christianity.  \n  – Pōka‘ī’s injury and bearing a child may symbolize the societal disruptions and the loss of sacred law, while the interaction among these characters mirrors tensions between traditional authority and new social realities.\n\n• Overall symbolic message:\n  – The story may serve as an allegory of the transition from traditional Hawaiian societal norms towards a transformed social order, with characters embodying old values, new influences, and the conflicts therein.\n  – It hints at how personal relationships and societal structures were impacted by external forces, foreshadowing Polynesian adaptation to changing religious and cultural influences post-1820.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
