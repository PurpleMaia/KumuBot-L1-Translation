Seeing all the children, they all ran, and they stood on a little hill out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i then spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: \"'Look!

Those were his prayers: \"Aloha (love/affection) only is my gaze, O eaves (no‘a) of the kea (possibly a metaphor), May it scatter, may it break apart, perhaps to eat, perhaps to leave behind—Nākukui‘aimakaokalani (the bright-eyed sky-gazing Kuki ‘aimakaokalani), that is Kukui‘aimakaokalani, my friend, Nāmakaokai‘a the great chief of Hawai‘i.

  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "• Allegorical interpretation of characters and events:\n  – Puali‘i, as a figure of authority or perhaps a rogue noble, represents a threat to the community’s safety; his act of wielding a ko‘ilipi (knife) signifies violence or a dangerous test of power. The imagery of him throwing 'akula (like a spear or throwing motion) suggests aggressive intent.\n  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o, whose name means \"Sea-Dwellers (Nāmaka) of the chiefs (pāo'o),\" symbolizes a venerable and possibly sacred figure—perhaps a chief, guardian, or personification of spiritual or societal authority. His kneeling and prayerful stance reflect humility and spiritual focus in the face of danger.\n  – The children’s flight signifies innocence and vulnerability, emphasizing the peril faced from the wielding of raw power or violence.\n\n• Names and symbolic references:\n  – Puali‘i: \"Puali‘i\" can be broken into \"Pu-ali‘i\" (“ruler’s gun/authority”), indicating a person with noble or commanding status, possibly corrupted or aggressive.\n  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o: \"Nāmaka\" means \"sea (Nā) of (o) the full (maka) eyes or gaze,\" indicating a divine or oceanic intelligence; \"pāo'o\" often refers to a chief or principal figure, suggesting high rank or spiritual authority.\n  – The phrase \"Nākukui‘aimakaokalani\" (\"the clouds (kuki) with eyes (‘aimaka) of the sky (lani)\") evokes celestial observation, perhaps symbolizing wisdom or divine oversight.\n\n• Cultural and historical context:\n  – The narrative likely echoes the Ai Kapu era (before 1819), a time of strict religious and social codes, where violence or threats to sacred authority would be critically condemned.\n  – The act of prayer and invocation of divine or ancestral protection aligns with traditional Hawaiian spiritual practices, especially during times of social upheaval or threat.\n  – The story's tension, involving threat and prayer, could reflect post-contact social commentaries—a critique of destructive behaviors or overreach of power, especially as Hawaiian society faced external influences after 1820 (e.g., missionaries, Western powers).\n\n• Symbolism and deeper themes:\n  – The “ko‘ilipi” (knife) within the story symbolizes not only physical violence but also the potential rupture of social harmony or kapu (sacred laws).\n  – The final prayer, with references to love, scattering, and leaving behind, suggests a plea for mercy or spiritual grace amid impending destruction—possibly an allegory for societal or spiritual decay.\n  – The mention of specific natural elements (the sea, clouds, the sky) emphasizes interconnectedness with nature, reflective of traditional Hawaiian worldview where natural elements are spiritual agents.\n\n• Possible social commentary or critique:\n  – The narrative may be a subtle critique of those in authority who threaten or pursue their own interests at the expense of community harmony, illustrating the peril of neglecting spiritual guidance.\n  – The plea for mercy and the imagery of death and scattering could symbolize the loss of traditional values or the chaos that ensues when social order is disturbed—especially relevant during periods of colonization or societal upheaval.\n  – The text’s layered symbolism encourages reflection on the importance of spiritual humility, community cohesion, and respect for sacred authority, themes central to Hawaiian cultural resilience.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
