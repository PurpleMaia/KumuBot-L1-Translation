  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "He was sitting there, eating, with his two sweet potato patches, which he had planted and maintained, and these patches remain to this day, they are called Nāmakaokapāo'o's patches. When the sweet potatoes matured, Puali'i recited a vow: “When the head of the ulua fish and the sweet potato are roasted together, I will eat my fill, then my wife, Pōka'ī, and others will also eat.” Accordingly, Puali'i went to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for 'i'a (fish) to eat along with the sweet potatoes.",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "• Paragraph 4 presents a scene where Puali'i is engaged in both long-term cultivation and eventual ritual or symbolic action:  \n  – He is sitting at his cultivated sweet potato patches ( māla ʿuala ), which he has planted and tended, emphasizing Hawaiian agricultural practices and the importance of taro and sweet potato cultivation, central to sustenance and social stability in traditional society.  \n  – The multiple māla ʿuala, noted as “two and more,” suggest either a significant investment or widespread cultivation, indicating Puali'i's prosperity or strategic resource management. The phrase “which remain to this day” (ā hiki i kēia lā) hints at the lasting significance of his effort, perhaps symbolizing legacy or continuity in land use.  \n  – The invocation of the name Nāmakaokapāo'o's patches connects the scene to the mythic figure introduced earlier—implying that these patches are not mere agricultural plots but are linked to divine or mythic authority, possibly symbolizing ancestral land or the sacredness of the land itself.  \n• The vow recited by Puali'i — “When the head of the ulua and the sweet potato are roasted together” — serves multiple cultural and symbolic functions:  \n  – In Hawaiian tradition, ulua (Giant Trevally) fish are considered a sacred, high-status fish, often associated with strong mana (divine power). Roasting ulua head and sweet potato together might symbolize harmony between aquatic and terrestrial resources, a metaphor for balance between different elements of land and sea, or the integration of gods' blessings into daily life.  \n  – The vow indicates a ritualistic or symbolic act of gratitude or alliance with the natural and divine order, and the act of “eating one’s fill” signifies fulfillment, abundance, and success.  \n  – The subsequent mention that “my wife, Pōka'ī, and others will also eat” emphasizes communal sharing and the importance of family, kinship, and social cohesion in Hawaiian culture—food being a central element in Hawai'i's communal and spiritual life.  \n• The final sentence, where Puali'i goes to Honouliuli to fish (‘ī'a), highlights traditional subsistence practices:  \n  – Before modern commerce, fishing was a vital part of everyday sustenance and a cultural act connected to respect for the ocean and its creatures.  \n  – This act complements his agricultural efforts, reflecting a holistic approach to resource use—integrating land and sea—key themes in traditional Hawaiian life and worldview.  \n• The narrative’s overall structure emphasizes the interconnectedness of land cultivation, ritual vow, and fishing—each element representing essential aspects of Hawaiian sustenance and spiritual harmony.  \n  – The inclusion of a vow underscores the spiritual dimension, where actions are intertwined with divine and ancestral power, reinforcing the cultural importance of covenants with nature and the gods.  \n  – The continuity “to this day” (kāhei) sheds light on the deep-rooted value of land, ritual, and resource management, which serve as bedrocks of Hawaiian identity and social life across generations.  \n• From a socio-cultural perspective, this passage reflects the customary practices of resource management, spiritual vows—akin to the ‘oli and pule—and the vital role of land, sea, and community in sustaining Hawaiian society.  \n  – It also alludes to the importance of land boundaries and naming—such as the specific referencing of Nāmakaokapāo'o's patches—which connect land stewardship with mythic authority, reinforcing the sacred relationship Hawaiian people maintain with their environment.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
