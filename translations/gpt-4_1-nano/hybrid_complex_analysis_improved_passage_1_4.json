As for the ‘uala, Puali‘i spoke his oath, “Where the head of the ulua (giant trevally) is buried with the ‘uala, I and my wife Pōka‘ī will eat from it, and afterwards, she, Pōka‘ī, and others may eat.” Therefore, Puali‘i went to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for i‘a (fish) along with ‘uala (taro).",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "• Allegorical symbolism of the land, fishing, and crops\n  – The fields (‘māla) and ‘uala symbolize sustenance, fertility, and a connection to land and water resources typical of traditional Hawaiian subsistence practices. \n  – ‘Nāmakaokapāo‘o’ as a place name may evoke a sacred or ancestral domain, anchoring the narrative in specific sacred geography connected to kānaka (people) livelihood and spiritual identity.\n\n• The character Puali‘i and oath symbolism\n  – ‘Puali‘i’—the prefix ‘Pu-’ often denotes foundation or origin, while ‘-li‘i’ suggests growth or increasing; his name may symbolize a foundational leader or someone linked to growth and authority.\n  – His oath about the ulua’s head buried with the ‘uala’ possibly signifies a ritual or spiritual condition, emphasizing the importance of place-based mo‘olelo (stories) and kōʻā (promises) grounded in sacred geography and genealogy.\n\n• The significance of the ulua and ‘uala\n  – The ulua (giant trevally) often symbolizes strength, leadership, and abundance in Hawaiian lore.\n  – The act of burying the ulua’s head with the ‘uala’ may be an allegory for balancing the strength (ulua) and sustenance (taro), reflecting an ideal harmony between power and sustenance.\n\n• Reference to Honouliuli and traditional fishing practices\n  – Honouliuli, a known coastal area, connects the story to established fishing and gathering sites, emphasizing the importance of specific locations for resource acquisition.\n  – Fishing for i‘a and gathering ‘uala are fundamental Hawaiian activities, signifying self-sufficiency and connection to natural cycles.\n\n• Broader historical context\n  – The story, with its emphasis on land, fishing, and oath-taking, reflects traditional pre-contact Hawaiian society, where resource management, sacred sites, and genealogical ties were constitutional.\n  – The narrative context suggests a time before the profound disruptions of the ‘Ai Kapu’ era or the 1819 abandonment, before heavy European influence, where oral traditions reinforced social order and spiritual values.\n  – The emphasis on ritualized promises and land boundaries indicates societal norms rooted in mālama (‘to care for’), lokomaika‘i (‘generosity’), and respect for sacred geography.\n\n• Cultural and social commentary\n  – The oath about the ulua’s head may also serve as a metaphor for social contracts—promises that bind individuals and their families to land, resource stewardship, and spiritual obligations.\n  – The story subtly underscores the importance of honoring connections to ‘āina (land) and kai (sea), themes central to Hawaiian cultural resilience and identity.\n  \n• Overall significance\n  – This passage encapsulates the symbiotic relationship between land, water, and community, emphasizing respect for natural and spiritual resources.\n  – It also subtly hints at the continuity of leadership, tradition, and the sacredness of place, which would have been challenged during the post-contact period and colonization efforts, yet remains foundational to Hawaiian worldview.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
