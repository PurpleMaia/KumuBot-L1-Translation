  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "The warrior Ama'u heard the call, and he prepared his eighteen war canoes, sailing down to Ewa to meet Nāmakaokapāo'o. When Ama'u and his people arrived at Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o emerged, destroying everything completely—no one was spared—and Ama'u died. The island of O'ahu was then filled with Nāmakaokapāo'o, and afterward, he told his mother and took control over the island of O'ahu.",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nThe warrior Ama'u heard the call, and he prepared his eighteen war canoes, sailing down to Ewa to meet Nāmakaokapāo'o. When Ama'u and his people arrived at Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o emerged, destroying everything completely—no one was spared—and Ama'u died. The island of O'ahu was then filled with Nāmakaokapāo'o, and afterward, he told his mother and took control over the island of O'ahu.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• Allegorical interpretation of Ama'u and Nāmakaokapāo'o:\n  – Ama'u, a warrior figure, could symbolize a vital force or a guardian representing the strength and resilience of the people, preparing a formidable fleet of 'eighteen' war canoes—possibly an allusion to a significant number in Hawaiian lore (e.g., 18 great chiefs or a symbolic number denoting completeness).\n  – Nāmakaokapāo'o, a sea goddess, embodies destructive natural forces—storm, chaos, or upheaval—manifested in the story as a destructive power that annihilates Ama'u’s force, illustrating the uncontrollable power of nature and the divine.\n  \n• The number 18 (\"hēmi kumamāwalu\"):\n  – May symbolize a specific societal number, such as interconnected chiefly lines or ritual groups; it might also relate to the concept of 'huina' (a set or complete group).\n  – Could be a poetic or cosmic number representing cycles or wholeness, fitting within Hawaiian tradition of numerology.\n\n• Character names and their symbolic meanings:\n  – Ama'u (meaning ‘alga’ or ‘seaweed’) suggests something rooted to the sea—fundamental in Hawaiian life and myth.\n  – Nāmakaokapāo'o (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o: ‘the eyes of the Pāo'o [a sacred bird or divine entity]’) signifies divine vision or awareness, perhaps omnipresent, embodying divine wrath or sovereignty over the ocean and land.\n\n• Cultural and historical context:\n  – The story echoes themes from traditional Hawaiian mythology, where gods and natural phenomena demonstrate divine sovereignty—here, the destructive power of Nāmakaokapāo'o aligns with her mythological role as a sea goddess associated with storm and upheaval.\n  – The narrative reflects the themes of conquest, divine authority, and natural forces intruding upon human endeavors—parallels to the period of contact, societal upheavals, and eventual land transfer under external influences.\n  – The ‘destruction’ and ‘taking control’ could symbolize historical shifts, such as the decline of traditional kapu systems (notably the Ai Kapu era, ending in 1819) and the subsequent upheaval caused by outside influences, including missionaries and settlers after 1820.\n\n• Symbolism of the island of O'ahu:\n  – O'ahu standing ‘full of Nāmakaokapāo'o’ suggests the island’s vulnerability and the divine representation of natural power shaping its fate.\n  – The figure of Nāmakaokapāo'o 'telling his mother and claiming the land' might allegorize the divine right or inherent sovereignty of land and sea, emphasizing ancestral authority and the sacredness of land ownership.\n\n• Narrative as social commentary:\n  – The story may serve as an allegory for the tumultuous transition from traditional divine rulership and societal order to a period of chaos and upheaval following contact.\n  – It underscores the idea that natural and divine forces ('Nāmakaokapāo'o') are ultimately dominant, reflecting a worldview where human efforts are subordinate to the divine and natural order.\n  – The story’s focus on destruction and eventual control could critique or reflect anxieties about external forces (colonial, missionary influence) overtaking traditional Hawaiian sovereignty.\n\n• Overall, this passage encapsulates themes of divine power, natural upheaval, and societal transformation, using mythic characters and numbers to encode deeper cultural meanings rooted in Hawaiian cosmology and history.",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
