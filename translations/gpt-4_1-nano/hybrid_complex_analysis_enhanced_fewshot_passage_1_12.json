When they reached the school of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was present. They prepared to leave, when Nāmakaokapāo'o called from the head of the group. Hearing a voice, but not seeing anyone's body, they asked: \"Where are you, who is calling out?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied: \"Here I am, up here.\" Suddenly, eight men climbed up—four on each side of the house, with Nāmakaokapāo'o found in the middle. They asked: \"What are you calling us for?\" The men answered: \"We come to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o, that small boy like yourself, who is strong and brave, the one who killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nA ship dispatched by 'Ama'u the chief from Waikīkī arrived, with four warriors. On the same boat were about thirty-eight men, making a total of forty-four people. When they reached the school of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was present. They prepared to leave, when Nāmakaokapāo'o called from the head of the group.

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
