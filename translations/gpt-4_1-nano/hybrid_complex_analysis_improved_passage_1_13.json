  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o spoke: \"I know I am a great person, and I am now going to Ko'olau, and I am the one with that name.\"  \nThey responded: \"No, it is you, that is what we have heard, therefore, you will be killed by us, you will not survive.\"  \nNā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o then said: \"Let us go back down to fight.\" When they reached down, Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o, exhausted from death, and only one person remained, that being the one who ran swiftly to find 'Ama'u in Waikīkī; he spoke of their death to all of them, and he was the one who, when asked, would listen to 'Ama'u.\"",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>  \nNā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o spoke: \"I know I am a great person, and I am now going to Ko'olau, and I am the one with that name.\"  \nThey responded: \"No, it is you, that is what we have heard, therefore, you will be killed by us, you will not survive.\"  \nNā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o then said: \"Let us go back down to fight.\" When they reached down, Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o, exhausted from death, and only one person remained, that being the one who ran swiftly to find 'Ama'u in Waikīkī; he spoke of their death to all of them, and he was the one who, when asked, would listen to 'Ama'u.\"  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• The passage depicts a confrontation between Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o and a group that dismisses his identity and threatens his life, emblematic of a spiritual or social conflict.  \n  – The phrase \"Ua 'ike au, he kanaka nui nō\" suggests Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o’s awareness of his own noble or elevated status, possibly representing an alias or an ancestral spirit claiming significance.  \n  – Their response—\"You will die; you will not survive\"—may symbolize rejection of a truth or identity, reflecting societal or spiritual suppression, especially during the Ai Kapu era when certain truths or deities were suppressed (Garth, 1976).  \n  \n• The name Nā Maka-o-ka-Pāo'o is rich in symbolism:  \n  – Etymology breakdown: 'Nā Maka' (the eyes or faces), 'o ka Pāo'o' (possibly referencing a place or a specific spiritual concept), suggesting a mystical observer or a figure of insight.  \n  – The phrase \"Pāo'o\" may relate to a sacred or significant location or concept, perhaps alluding to spiritual enlightenment or ancestral knowledge, aligning with Hawaiian cultural values of inoa (names) bearing deep meanings (Bingham, 1996).  \n  \n• The narrative may symbolize a spiritual or social struggle:  \n  – The act of going \"ma Ko'olau\" (towards the mountains) can be allegorical for ascending spiritual realms, or seeking refuge in ancestral lands—an important motif in Hawaiian tradition.  \n  – The final act of only one survivor—\"ka i holo aku ā loa'a 'o 'Ama'u ma Waikīkī\"—may reflect the dispersal or survival of knowledge or spirit after conflict, possibly mirroring post-1840 shifts where old beliefs persisted amidst colonial and missionary influence (Vaughan, 1996).  \n  – The mention of 'Ama'u in Waikīkī could symbolize the enduring nature of native knowledge or spirit, as 'Ama'u (Ferns) are significant in Hawaiian ecology and spirituality, representing resilience and connection to the land.  \n  \n• Overall, this passage could critique marginalization or suppression of native identity, emphasizing perseverance and the importance of ancestral knowledge amidst adversity—an allegory for cultural resilience during and after the profound societal shifts following the abolition of the kapu system and increased Western contact.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
