  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was destroying, one after another, the taro patches above another taro patch; just as she was destroying the two patches altogether, the appearance of the taro leaves was about six and a half in size—roughly the size of the two patches combined. Then, Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned and set fire, pouring four bundles of oil onto the steaming taro corms on the kalua pit. While she was pouring the oil onto the fire, her mother, Kāʻiliki, arrived and asked her, “ʻAʻole (No).” Puali‘i responded: “Yes, it is the head and eyes that determine the fate of my taro today, which is why this is the day I will die.”",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "• Allegorical interpretation of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s actions:\n  – The character represents a disruptive, perhaps destructive force, possibly embodying natural or social upheaval.\n  – Her destruction of the taro patches signifies an act of reaping or eradicating established sustenance, perhaps reflecting societal disruptions during a period of upheaval or change.\n  – The repeated destruction and the size of the leaves—“about six and a half” — may symbolize cycles or numerological significance, hinting at an ongoing or perpetual conflict.\n\n• Cultural symbolism of the taro patches (‘uala) and their destruction:\n  – Taro (kalo) is central to Hawaiian sustenance and spiritual life; its destruction symbolizes loss, upheaval, or the desecration of traditional stability.\n  – The act of setting fire and pouring oil contrasts traditional reverence with destructive acts, possibly reflecting post-contact tensions where sacred practices were challenged or co-opted.\n  – The “two patches” combined into one suggests unity or a significant transformation—perhaps the blending, conflict, or loss of traditional social units.\n\n• Names and their meanings:\n  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o: “The eyes of Pāo'o” or “The gaze of Pāo'o,” possibly referring to a divine or watchful aspect tasked with overseeing or judging.\n  – Pōka‘ī: “The darkness of the night,” symbolizing mystery, death, or transition, hinting at spiritual or inevitable change.\n  – Puali‘i: “A great chief or ruler,” indicating authority, but here perhaps a symbolic stand-in for fate or destiny, emphasizing the importance of hierarchy and spiritual balance.\n  – Kāʻiliki: The mother figure, possibly representing cultural memory, tradition, or ancestral power, intervening at a moment of crisis.\n\n• Cultural and historical context:\n  – The narrative resembles motifs from the Ai Kapu era (pre-1819 Hawaiʻi), where sacred practices and social order were central.\n  – The mention of setting fire and possibly sacrificial language echoes the upheaval of the traditional kapu system, leading up to the 1819 abandonment of the kapu.\n  – The dialogue about death and fate could mirror societal anxieties during the post-contact period, where traditional ways were challenged by external influences such as missionaries and colonial pressures (post-1820 influence).\n\n• Possible social commentary:\n  – The story encapsulates themes of destruction and the inevitability of change, perhaps critiquing or reflecting on the loss of traditional authority.\n  – The dialogue about “the head and eyes” determining death may symbolize how leadership or spiritual insight guides or forewarns of societal transformation.\n  – The involvement of maternal authority (Kāʻiliki) suggests the importance of ancestral or divine guidance in navigating upheaval, hinting at concerns about losing cultural identity during times of crisis.\n\n• Overall, the passage uses mythic figures and natural symbolism to encode debates over social order, spiritual balance, and cultural survival amid historical upheaval, illustrating the tension between preservation and destruction inherent in Hawaiʻi’s transitional periods.",

  "reference_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \\[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;"
