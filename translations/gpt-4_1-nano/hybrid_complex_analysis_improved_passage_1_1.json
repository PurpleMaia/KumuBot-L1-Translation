  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "He very small child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and a very courageous child in his youth, who has no rival among these islands from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau, in his youth is very small and very brave.

  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "• Allegorical significance of the child Nāmakaokapāo‘o:\n  – Represents a legendary or mythic hero embodying both youthfulness and formidable strength, possibly serving as a cultural symbol of resilience or divine claim.\n  – His lack of rivals “ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau” suggests a domain or sovereignty extending across the Hawaiian archipelago, indicating a figure of widespread influence or spiritual authority.\n\n• Name analysis of Nāmakaokapāo‘o:\n  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o can be broken down as “Nā-maka” (eyes or faces), “o-ka” (of the), and “pāo‘o” (possibly from pā‘o‘o, meaning to cut or to initiate). \n  – Could symbolize “the faces/eyes of Pā‘o‘o” or “the divine eye of Pā‘o‘o,” hinting at awareness, insight, or divine observation, aligning with her mythic status.\n  – Alternatively, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o may reference a guardian or perceptive deity, emphasizing spiritual insight or sovereignty.\n\n• Cultural symbolism of ‘u‘uku loa (very small) and koa loa (very brave/warrior-like):\n  – Reflects traditional Hawaiian ideals valorized in youth: strength and bravery, but also humility in being “‘u‘uku” (small)—a recurring motif emphasizing that true greatness need not be physical size.\n  – Reinforces the cultural value of spiritual and moral strength over mere physical attributes.\n\n• Parentage and regional ties:\n  – Kauluakaha‘i from Kahikipapaialewa, linked to Kahikinu‘u, sites that are historically significant and symbolic, perhaps representing specific mana-rich regions or chiefly lines.\n  – The mention of a high chief father “no Kahikipapaialewa” and “he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona,” indicating divine or semi-divine lineage—common in Hawaiian aristocratic genealogies—integrating spiritual authority with temporal rule.\n  – The maternal figure Pōka‘ī, suggests another noble or divine lineage, as “Pō” (night) and “ka‘ī” (to bind) often carry spiritual or ancestral significance.\n\n• Historical/cultural context:\n  – The narrative emphasizes chiefly and divine lineage, typical of genealogies (“ mo‘okū‘auhau”) that legitimize authority and mana.\n  – Its content reflects the pre-contact or early contact era where legends served to reinforce social hierarchies and spiritual authority.\n  – Possible comment on social stratification, divine right, and ancestral heroism, especially from the Ai Kapu era up to the abolition of kapu and the influence of Christian missionaries (early 19th century).\n\n• Broader symbolic themes:\n  – The lineage and divine attributes suggest a narrative that underscores the importance of genealogy, divine ancestry, and leadership.\n  – The mention of “‘ohe ona lua” (no rival) may symbolize ultimate sovereignty, perhaps critiquing or affirming the divine right of certain chiefly lines, or reflecting the social aspiration to divine order.\n  – The blend of mythic elements and regional references points to a worldview where divine authority and land are intertwined, advocating for reverence of the ancestors and land.\n\n• Overall, this passage functions both as an ancestral genealogy and as a mythic allegory emphasizing divine origins, divine justice, and heroic qualities, serving to legitimize chiefly authority and cultural values rooted in spiritual symbolism and genealogical memory.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.",
