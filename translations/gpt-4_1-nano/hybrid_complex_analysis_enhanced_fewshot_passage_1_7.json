  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "**English Translation:**  \nPuali'i began to cut the sweet potato stems with his knife and then, upon reaching the middle, he found Nāmakaokapāo'o engaged in stabbing at the four sweet potato vines with his spear, over the fire. He saw all the children at once and swiftly ran and stood at a distance because he was afraid of Puali'i. Then Puali'i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo'o: \"Hey! Here is the knife in my hand, a tool for cutting off your head today, and I will cut your head and roast it with sweet potato, then eat it first, and then everything will be fine.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o did not heed Puali’i’s words; instead, he continued to speak again, the second time. Puali'i was prepared to cut off Nāmakaokapāo'o's head with his knife at that moment when Nāmakaokapāo'o was praying his death prayer. It went like this:  \n\"Kindly be the eyes of my warrior place, Oh, may you float away, may you be wrapped up,  \nperhaps eaten, perhaps left behind,  \nmaybe Nākukui‘aimakaokalani, that is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,  \nmy beloved place,  \nNā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is the great chief of Hawaii,  \nfloat away, float away with the spear,  \nthe spear and the pahu drum,  \ndie, Nāmakaokapāo'o.\"",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**  \n• The scene depicted is intense and highly symbolic, involving themes of confrontation, ritual, and perhaps death, set against a traditional Hawaiian context of spiritual and physical combat.  \n• The act of Puali'i wielding a ‘ko‘ilipi (a cutting implement, presumably a knife or spear) to threaten Nāmakaokapāo'o signifies a moment of mortal conflict, but also echoes traditional Hawaiian notions of struggle, perhaps reflecting allegories of social or divine confrontation.  \n• The place of the scene — over the fire, with sweet potatoes ('uala) being cooked — invokes the significance of ‘Ai Kapu practices, where fire and food often symbolize sacred offerings and communal rituals. The ‘uala, as a staple and sacred crop, is central to Hawaiian life, and its connection to rituals of conquest or sacrifice is profound, especially in the context of mythic or ancestral battles.  \n• The mention of Nāmakaokapāo'o praying his death prayer adds a layered dimension, blending the physical act of violence with spiritual invocation, aligning with Hawaiian cultural values where death and prayer often intersect in rituals related to warfare, kapu, and spiritual protection.\n\n• The name etymologies and symbolic references include:  \n– **Nāmakaokapāo'o:**  \n→ ‘Nā Mama’ (the eyes) + ‘ka pāo’o’ (possibly linked to a poetic or mythic phrase). The name may poetically symbolize a vigilant or watchful warrior, with ocular imagery representing vigilance or divine sight.  \n– **Puali'i:**  \n→ ‘Pu’ (to push or extend) + ‘li’i’ (small, young; descendant or chief, as in ‘li’i’ - little or junior chief). The name implies a youthful leader or someone with royal or noble lineage, fitting for a character engaging in heroic or ritual acts.  \n– Our scholarly focus notes that this scene echoes mythic themes of conflict, sacrifice, and spiritual integrity, with the invocation of the prayer showcasing a cultural trait: invoking ancestors or divine forces at moments of peril or death—recurring in Hawaiian mele and mo‘olelo.\n\n• The prayer itself is deeply poetic and reflects the Hawaiian worldview:  \n– It expresses a desire for spiritual protection, symbolized through references to sacred places ('Nā Maka-o-ka-pāo'o, Nākukui‘aimakaokalani) and ancestral entities—implying that even in conflict and potential death, spiritual kinship and protection are paramount.  \n– The rhythm and repetition (‘ōhene), typical of Hawaiian oratory and chant, serve to reinforce the spiritual significance of the moment—turning a scene of violence into a sacred prayer for divine oversight and protection.\n\n• Overall, this passage intertwines storytelling, ritual, and cultural values—highlighting the importance of spirituality in conflict, the sacredness of food as an offering, and honoring kūpuna and deities in moments of life-and-death struggle. This reflects the broader Hawaiian worldview: a society where spiritual force, kinship, and nature are inseparably linked in every act, including those of confrontation and acceptance of mortality.  \n• Historically, such narratives may echo the practices of the 'Ai Kapu era, wherein human sacrifice and sacred rituals often intertwined, but also symbolize the ongoing cultural resilience in storytelling, prayer, and the importance of divine protection in Hawaiian tradition.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
