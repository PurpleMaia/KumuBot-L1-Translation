  "gpt-4_1-nano_translation": "Then, he took his mother and hid her in the cave of Waipouli. The mother disappeared, and they returned to their house at Keahumoa, where they resumed living. Then Nāmakaokapāo'o ascended to the roof of the house, lifted the mat of his back and face, and laid himself down amidst the top of the house’s ridgepole.",
  "gpt-4_1-nano_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nThen, he took his mother and hid her in the cave of Waipouli. The mother disappeared, and they returned to their house at Keahumoa, where they resumed living. Then Nāmakaokapāo'o ascended to the roof of the house, lifted the mat of his back and face, and laid himself down amidst the top of the house’s ridgepole.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• Allegorical depiction of concealment and protection within Hawaiian cultural space\n  – The act of hiding the mother in Waipouli’s cave may symbolize shielding kinship or spiritual essence from danger or societal upheaval.\n  – The return to the house at Keahumoa could represent the re-establishment of harmony or stability after a period of concealment.\n\n• Character analysis and symbolic meanings of names\n  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o literally means “The Eyes of Pāo'o,” where “Nā-maka” (eyes) often symbolize vigilance, spiritual insight, or ancestral observation in Hawaiian thought (Kanahele, 1986). \n  – The name suggests a character with heightened awareness or spiritual significance, perhaps a guardian figure or a celestial being watching over the household.\n\n• The act of Nā-makaokapāo'o ascending to the roof and elevating the mat symbolizes a removal of concealment or a transition to a higher state.\n  – The roof, or \"pōhaku o ke kauhale,\" is a sacred boundary between the spiritual and physical realms (Nālani, 1990).\n  – Lifting the mat could indicate revealing or affirming one’s spiritual authority or status, often associated with chiefs or spiritual leaders.\n\n• Cultural and historical context\n  – The narrative reflects traditional Hawaiian practices of kinship concealment and the importance of spatial boundaries—like caves and house structures—as sacred or protective sites.\n  – The scene occurs likely during or after the Ai Kapu era, a period characterized by strict social and spiritual taboos, which emphasized concealment for protection (Kamakau, 1961).\n  – The movement to reassert order after concealment might allegorically reference the societal transitions following the 1819 abolition of the kapu system, signaling a shift from secretive traditional authority toward more open cultural expression influenced by post-contact changes.\n\n• Broader interpretive point\n  – The passage may serve as an allegory for societal concealment of knowledge or spiritual authority, and the act of revealing or affirming this authority as a necessary step toward restored harmony.\n  – The imagery of the house, cave, and elevation aligns with Hawaiian cosmological concepts of sacred space and spiritual hierarchy, emphasizing the importance of balance between concealment and revelation in maintaining societal stability.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
