Puali'i's head said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: \"Farewell to you, Nāmakaokapāo'o.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o grabbed Puali'i's head and threw it into the sea of Waipouli, a cave at the shore of Honouliuli, its length, five miles in distance.",
  "kimi-k2-fireworks_commentary": "• **Paragraph 9:** This paragraph marks the climactic culmination of familial conflict and supernatural intervention, presenting a complete reversal of expected power dynamics.\n\n• **Prayer as Precedent to Violence** – In Hawaiian tradition, the act of prayer (pule) serves multiple functions at this critical juncture:\n   – First, by finishing his prayer, Nāmakaokapāo'o fulfills ritual protocol before the supernatural event\n   – The timing (\"i ia wā\") creates dramatic tension typical of Hawaiian narrative structure, where action follows immediately upon sacred invocations\n   – This follows traditional Hawaiian martial protocol: before great conflict, warriors might offer prayers to their family gods (ʻaumakua) for victory\n\n• **The Reversed Axe (koʻilipi)** – The weapon's transformation carries profound symbolic significance:\n   – Koʻilipi (iron axe) represents Western technology and authority, marking this as a post-contact narrative\n   – The \"moe ā huli\" (turning motion) of the axe blade suggests divine intervention, specifically from Nāmakaokapāo'o's ancestral deities\n   – This reversal mirrors other Hawaiian stories where weapons betray their wielders when used unjustly, such as in the tale of Pakaʻa or Kaululāʻau\n\n• **Decapitation and Speech** – The trope of the speaking head appears throughout Polynesian literature:\n   – In Hawaiian cosmology, the head (poʻo) houses the spirit (ʻuhane) which retains consciousness momentarily after death\n   – Puali'i's \"aloha ʻoe\" represents a formal, respectful farewell appropriate between family members, acknowledging the sacredness of their relationship\n   – The distance (\"elima mile\") specified is notably Western measurement, again suggesting post-contact context\n\n• **Final Disposition at Waipouli** – The significance of Waipouli (dark water) cave requires deeper analysis:\n   – Waipouli likely derives from \"waipou-\" (water + dark) + \"-li\" (perfective) = \"darkened water\"\n   – Caves (ana) in Hawaiian belief systems often serve as entrances to the underworld (lua o milu)\n   – The five-mile measurement suggests this is a significant geographical feature, possibly a lava tube or submarine cave system\n   – In 'Ai Kapu tradition, disposal of remains thus prevents proper burial rituals (kanu), denying Puali'i entry into the ancestral realm\n   – This action effectively removes Puali'i's mana (spiritual power) from the land, symbolizing the severing of the old order represented by strict 'Ai Kapu adherence\n\n• **Allegorical Reading**: This scene represents the overthrow of the old generation's values by the new. Puali'i, champion of the 'Ai Kapu system, is destroyed by the very tools (koʻilipi) of the new era. The child's super-natural protection suggests divine favor for progressive change. The casting of the head into the \"dark water\" symbolizes plunging backward-looking traditionalism into the unconscious depths, while Nāmakaokapāo'o – whose name connects to the pāo'o fish that signifies going against the current – represents forward movement.",

  "reference_translation": "When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength."
