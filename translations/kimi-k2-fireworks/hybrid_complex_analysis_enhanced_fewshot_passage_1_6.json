In this manner he pulled up and ruined both sweet potato patches until the mound of sweet potato leaves rose up, forty mounds being the total from the two patches. Then Nāmakaokapāo'o went back and started a fire, and began to broil four sweet potato vines on the fire pit that was burning. As he was broiling them atop the fire, his stepfather arrived home and reached the place. He questioned Nāmakaokapāo'o's mother, Pōka'ī.

  "kimi-k2-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**  \n• The child Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) engages in deliberate destruction of the agricultural foundation of subsistence - the 'uala (sweet potato) patches. This act represents more than mere childhood mischief; it is a calculated assault on the productive capacity of the land and the family's food security. The numbers given - two patches yielding forty mounds of plucked leaves - suggest an excessive and unreasonable destruction, perhaps indicating supernatural or precocious strength that transcends normal childhood capabilities.\n\n• The act of hō-'ā ahi (fire-starting) and 'ō-hinu (broiling/wilting) the sweet potato vines carries multilayered symbolism in Hawaiian thought. Sweet potato vines were not typically eaten raw but were the maka (eyes/seedlings) used for replanting, making their destruction a complete severing of future productive capacity. The number four ('ehā) vines specifically selected for broiling may reference the four districts of an ahupua'a or the four primary gods (Kū, Kāne, Lono, Kanaloa), though in this context it seems to intensify the transgression.\n\n• Pua-li'i's arrival as kōlea (stepfather) marks a critical dramatic turning point. The Hawaiian term kōlea (Pacific golden plover) carries metaphorical weight - the bird that arrives from distant lands, establishing this relationship as one of external alliance rather than blood kinship. His questioning of Pō-ka-'ī reveals the dynamics of domestic tension, where the biological mother attempts to shield her child while the stepfather asserts patriarchal authority.\n\n• The proposed consumption of \"ke po'o ona a me nā maka\" (his head and his eyes) as relish ('īna'i) for 'uala represents the ultimate inversion of proper relationship between humans and the agricultural cycle. In traditional Hawaiian thought:\n  – The 'uala (sweet potato) was considered the \"body\" of the land, with its maka (eyes) being the propagating elements\n  – Human heads (po'o) and eyes (maka) were considered sacred, never to be consumed\n  – The ulua fish commonly served as replacement for human sacrifice (as mentioned in footnotes), making Pua-li'i's threat to substitute human flesh for fish flesh a complete reversal of accepted ritual practice\n\n• This passage allegorically represents the conflict between traditionalist adherence to 'Ai Kapu (eating restrictions) and progressive abandonment of old ways. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, as a child of mixed divine ancestry (Kauluakaha'i being part akua), embodies the future that moves beyond restrictive practices. His destruction can be read as a preliminary dismantling of old agricultural-ritual systems that tied human life-force directly to food production and tabu observance. Pua-li'i's response represents the violent retribution of tradition against such revolutionary change.\n\n• The location of this confrontation - amidst destroyed 'uala patches - transforms productive space into battlefield, productive resources into weapons of destruction. The child who destroys forty mounds of life-giving plants becomes the feast for \"his day to die\" (eia kona lā e make ai ia'u), completing a cycle where the land ultimately consumes the transgressor rather than sustaining community life.",

  "reference_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \\[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;"
