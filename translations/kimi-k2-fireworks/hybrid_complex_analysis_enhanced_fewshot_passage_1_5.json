  "kimi-k2-fireworks_translation": "When Puali'i had gone fishing, at that time Nāmakaokapāo'o went with seventeen children to the sweet potato patches of Puali'i. At that time, Nāmakaokapāo'o's body was very small, two and a half feet tall (literally: two feet and a half his height), his foreskin had not yet tightened, still loosely hanging. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, he commanded the children, \"Pull up completely every single mound with sweet potato leaves above, do not leave any growing.\" But the children were frightened, therefore they held back gently by the sweet potatoes, not pulling up a single mound.",
  "kimi-k2-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• This paragraph presents a carefully orchestrated scene of agricultural sabotage engineered by young Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, employing seventeen companions as accomplices in the destruction of Pua-li'i's sweet potato farms. The number seventeen carries significant weight in Hawaiian numerology - it is one unit beyond the sacred sixteen (kū), suggesting excess or transgression. The seventeen children function as a de facto army under Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's command, highlighting his precocious leadership qualities.\n\n• The physical description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o merits careful attention as it operates on multiple symbolic levels: **a)** His height - two and a half feet - places him far below normal stature for any age, marking him as an exceptional or perhaps non-human being; **b)** The explicit mention of his foreskin not being tightened (ʻʻaʻole i paʻa kona maʻi, e lewalewa ana nō'') operates as a cultural marker indicating extreme youth and social vulnerability. This biological detail serves as legal justification for his actions - as an uncircumcised youth, he exists outside the full boundaries of adult accountability in the 'Ai Kapu system. \n\n• The command structure demonstrates a child's mimicry of chiefly authority: he ʻkēnā akula'' (dispatched/stationed) the children with specific orders for total eradication (''ā pau loa i luna''). The children are tasked with removing not just the foliage but the entire mound system (''puʻe me ka lauʻuala''). This act represents the complete disruption of agricultural continuity - without mound systems and vine cuttings (maka), the sweet potatoes cannot regenerate, symbolically severing Pua-li'i's ability to provide for future generations.\n\n• The children's refusal (''makaʻu nō'' - they were afraid) provides a crucial counterpoint revealing the sacredness of cultivated land in Hawaiian thought. Their fear likely stemmed from: 1) Recognition of kapu (sacred restriction) regarding agricultural land; 2) Awareness of personal consequences from Pua-li'i; 3) Understanding that such wanton destruction violated fundamental principles of reciprocity with the land. Their ''kāohi mālie'' (gentle restraint) by the sweet potatoes suggests not mere disobedience but active preservation, physically protecting the mounds from destruction.\n\n• This scene allegorizes the tension between inherited chiefly prerogative (Pua-li'i's authority over the land) and emerging individual will (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's destructive autonomy). The sweet potato ('uala), being a relatively new introduction to the Hawaiian islands compared to taro (kalo), may represent foreign or innovated traditions that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o seeks to eradicate. His command seeks absolute annihilation - not just harvest but obliteration of regenerative capacity, prefiguring larger revolutionary cycles in Hawaiian society.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
