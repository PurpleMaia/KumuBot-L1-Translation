He paid a visit at Pōka'ī's house, looked at Pōka'ī and desired her. He said, \"I want you to be my woman.\" Pōka'ī said, \"How could you want me? I have given birth to a child and my body is ruined.\" Puali'i said, \"These things are nothing [to me]; if you desire me, let us lie together/sleep as a couple.\" Pōka'ī consented. Then Pōka'ī went with her man Puali'i to the plains of Keahumoa [to] live.",
  "kimi-k2-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:** • This passage represents a classic Hawaiian narrative trope of the \"stranger-protagonist\" who arrives and transforms the domestic circumstances of the female character. The story operates within the protocols of Hawaiian hospitality and courtship customs of the 'Ai Kapu period.\n\n**Courtship and Marriage Customs:**\n– Puali'i's appearance follows the expected pattern of 'hele hele' (journey/walking), specifically coming \"iho\" (down) from upland Līhu'e (Wāhi'āwā) to the shore (\"kai o Honouliuli\") – a classic land-to-sea movement that mirrors many Hawaiian stories of transformative encounters.\n– His status as \"he kanaka maika'i\" (a good man) indicates his moral character and suitability as a marriage partner. Unlike later Western concepts, \"maika'i\" in this context includes social standing, demeanor, and knowledge of proper protocol.\n– The phrase \"kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka'ī\" reflects the Hawaiian concept of 'hale kipa' (visiting house), where travelers could expect to receive hospitality according to the kapu system.\n\n**Symbolic Elements:**\n– The name Pua-li'i carries significant meaning: \"Pua\" (flower/blossom/offspring) + \"li'i\" (small, chiefly, exalted). This suggests either: 1) a person of chiefly descent (even if junior line), or 2) someone cherished like a precious flower.\n– The location \"Ke-ahu moa\" (mentioned in the following passage that establishes them there) means \"heap/chicken assembly\" – likely an area known for abundant chickens ('moa'), symbolizing fertility and household prosperity, appropriate for a new marriage site.\n\n**Gender Relations and Body Politics:**\n– Pōka'ī's response reveals Hawaiian attitudes toward motherhood and female sexuality. Her phrase \"ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua 'ino'ino ko'u kino\" [I have given birth to a child and my body is bad/ruined] reflects:\n  * The physical toll of childbirth in a pre-contact society\n  * Possible reference to postpartum restrictions and kapu surrounding childbirth\n  * The common Hawaiian practice of identifying significant life changes with \"inoa ho'omana'o\" (commemorative names) – notice she retains Pōka'ī (perhaps \"darkness/night falls upon the chief\") despite her changed circumstances\n– Puali'i's reassuring response \"he mea 'ole ia mau mea\" [these are nothing] demonstrates acceptance of maternal transformations – contra to Western taboos, Hawaiian culture often valorized motherhood as enhancing rather than diminishing female attractiveness and social status.\n\n**The 'Moe Kāua' Formula:**\n– The phrase \"e moe kāua\" carries nuanced meaning beyond simple \"let's sleep\" – it represents the traditional Hawaiian marriage proposal formula, signaling:\n  * Intent for long-term partnership (not casual sexual encounter)\n  * Mutual consent (note Pua-li'i's conditional \"ke makemake 'oe ia'u\" [if you desire me])\n  * Establishment of a new household unit\n  * The beginning of 'noho pu' (cohabitation) which, after four nights, would traditionally establish a common-law marriage\n\n**Spatial Movement and Settlement:**\n– Their movement from Honouliuli (coastal area) to Ke-ahu moa (plains/upland) represents:\n  * Transition from fishing/horticulture (appropriate for single mother) to taro farming/gathering (appropriate for couple)\n  * Typical Hawaiian pattern of village exogamy – Pōka'ī moves to her husband's district (Līhu'e)\n  * The creation of a new 'āina hānau (birth land) for their future children, while maintaining Pōka'ī's previous child's connections to Honouliuli\n\n**Narrative Function:**\n– This passage serves as economic and social stabilizer for the story: Nāmakaokapāo'o's presence as a fatherless child threatens the narrative, so he gains a stepfather who will provide resources and education\n– Puali'i's introduction as \"kanaka maika'i\" and future conflict with Nāmakaokapāo'o mirrors many mo'olelo where stepfathers serve as both educators and antagonists to brilliant but rebellious first-born children",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
