  "kimi-k2-fireworks_translation": "Puali‘i seized the sickle and went until he reached Nāmakaokapāo‘o who was roasting his four sweet-potato vines upon the fire. The moment all the other children saw this, they fled and stood at a distance, seized with fear of Puali‘i.\n\nPuali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o:\n“Hey! Here in my hand is a sickle, a thing to sever your head today; when your head is cut off, then it will be baked with the sweet potato and I shall eat before you. Only after that will you be freed.”\n\nNāmakaokapāo‘o paid no heed to these words of Puali‘i, so Puali‘i spoke again—this was the second time. Puali‘i was set to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the sickle.\n\nAt that instant Nāmakaokapāo‘o uttered his death-dealing prayer against Puali‘i. Thus he prayed:\n\nAffectionately seen is the eye of my place-of-pāo‘o,\nGrow gourd-like, lie scorched on the coals,\nTo be eaten perhaps, to be left perhaps,\nLet Nākukui‘āimakaokalani stay behind—\nThat is Kukui‘āimakaokalani,\nThat is my intimate companion.\nNāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i,\nLet him slip away, let the reckless one glide,\nMen indeed with the spear,\nThe spear indeed with the drum.\nThen will Puali‘i die at the hand of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "kimi-k2-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**  \n• This climactic moment contains three tightly braided motifs that recur throughout nineteenth-century Hawaiian moʻolelo: **a)** an older male relative raising a *koʻilipi* (cutting implement) against a child perceived as illegitimate or over-powerful; **b)** a *pule make* (death-dealing prayer) that turns aggression back upon the aggressor through the power of the spoken word; and **c)** a clear transfer of the narrative spotlight from an “older” generation still invested in *ʻAi Kapu* principles to a “child” who represents the post-ʻAi-Kapu world.\n\n– Etymology of *koʻilipi*: composed of *koi* “adze” and *lipi* “to cut, slice.” By choosing the *koʻilipi*—the farmer’s sickle for cutting sweet-potato vines—Pualiʻi symbolically attempts to sever the vegetal line that Nāmakaokapāoʻo embodies (the vines are his “eyes,” or *maka*). Ironically, the tool that should nurture the land becomes the weapon that threatens to decapitate the very fertility represented by the child.\n\n• Fear ripple and spatial codes: the phrase *kū maila lākou ma kahi lōʻihi* re-enacts on the physical landscape the social *lōʻihi* (distance) that enforced parental rights (*mākua* prerogatives) under *ʻAi Kapu* sexual codes. The “children” fled because bloodshed (*ʻai koko*) in their midst risked implicating them in violation of *ʻaʻa* (kinsperson) *kapu*. Running to a *kahi lōʻihi* kept the offender’s *hana hihia* (polluting act) within sight yet at a ritually contained distance.\n\n• Exchange of utterances forms a miniature *kāhea* (ritualized call-and-response):\n\n  – First utterance (“‘Ē!”): Pualiʻi announces the stroke itself, guaranteeing in *ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi* that *make* (death) can indeed be proclaimed aloud and therefore enacted. Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s refusal to *hoʻolohe* (listen/obey) breaks the required moment of respect, which in *ʻAi Kapu* logic invites supernatural retaliation.  \n  – Second utterance: Pualiʻi renews the threat by starting to swing. The doubling (*ka lua ia*) mirrors the *lua* (second twin birth-order) motif that appears in many stories: the *second* blow never lands, because the child born second—often the “younger” one—possesses a deeper ancestral *mana*.\n\n• The *pule make* itself is structured as a four-couplet chant:\n\n  1.  **Appeal to environment:** *Maka o kuʻu wahi pāoʻo* directly puns on the boy’s name, making the roasted sweet-potato vine (“eye of my planting place/pāoʻo fish mound”) a ritual surrogate for Pualiʻi’s head.  \n  2.  **Conditional outcomes:** *E ʻai paha, e waiho paha* mimics the *waiho* tabu word pronounced when a priest decided if the sacrificial victim remained alive or was eaten. Here the target is reversed: Pualiʻi becomes the *ʻai* (food).  \n  3.  **Invocation of cosmic/ancestral agent:** *Kukui-ā-imaka-o-ka-lani* (“Torch-of-the-eyes-of-the-heaven”) is probably a poetic designation of the planet Jupiter, said to be the watcher of night travellers. Referencing a celestial torch prepares the listener for the child-firebrand Nāmakaokapāoʻo himself to ignite supernatural conflagration.  \n  4.  **Performative closure:** *Heʻe lā… make nō* converts the weapon (ihe, pahu) into metonymic agents of Nāmakaokaiʻa—the high-chief-to-come who abolishes human sacrifice. By rhyming *ka pahu* (drum) with *make* (death) the chant echoes the drumming that accompanied *ʻheʻe* (slipping or gliding away), a proverbial way to describe escaping an older law.\n\n• Cultural resonance: in pre-Christian practice, the *pule make* was traditionally uttered in a temple or at the boundary-stones of a land division (*ahupuaʻa*) facing either the sea or the mountain, “where the voices go.” Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s decision to pronounce the chant where sweet-potatoes are being roasted reclaims the *ʻāina* itself as *heiau*—no longer is human blood required on an altar. Thus the *māla ʻuala* (garden patch) becomes the new *luakini*, and cultivation supplants sacrifice.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
