  "kimi-k2-fireworks_translation": "Puali'i died, and Nāmakaokapāo'o returned to his mother Pōka'ī to live with her. Nāmakaokapāo'o would not eat any food. At that time there was living 'Ama'u, a chief of O'ahu, residing in Waikīkī. A man from Honouliuli went up to Waikīkī where the chief was living. He said, “O Chief! A little boy of surpassing strength is dwelling at place X, his father has died and his head has been thrown far out to sea, a great distance, five miles offshore.” When 'Ama'u heard this he said, “When I pit my strength against his I will be killed by him, but unless I do fight him I will in no way be his equal.” While he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o heard these very words concerning himself.",
  "kimi-k2-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The child’s refusal to eat ('a'ole 'ai) appears as both grief (genuine mourning for the father-figure) and deliberate purification—a common practice among Hawaiian ritual specialists who fasted before dangerous undertakings. The verb “pai'ai” (to abstain from solid food, to refuse sustenance) was often linked to psychic preparation for battle or prophecy, suggesting Nāmakaokapāo'o is spiritually attuning himself for what is to come.\n\n• Spatial geography recalibrated: For the first time the physical stage contracts to O'ahu—specifically Honouliuli ↔ Waikīkī. Readers familiar with Māui literature will recall that Waikīkī (‘spouting water’) is traditionally paired with the heiau Papa‘ena‘ena, built by Kākuhihewa and later used by Kahekili. Establishing 'Ama'u (the “fern shoot,” ‘ama-‘u) as ruling chief from Waikīkī rather than the more politically central Wai-kīkī-‘olalo reinforces an ʻEwa–Honouliuli axis: the west-facing leeward plain that is repeatedly the locus of resistance, outsider characters, and transformational stories.\n\n• The runner from Honouliuli: The phrase “hele maila kekahi kanaka no Honouliuli mai” recreates the ancient institution of hele-lā-au-lā-ki (daily traveler-couriers) who carried political intelligence across ahupua‘a. His testimony—“ua 'ino 'ia kona po'o i kai loa… ‘elima mile ka lō‘ihi”—frames the father’s head as a navigational marker of improbable distance. “Five miles offshore” sits beyond the ʻahi‘ahi and ‘ula‘ula grounds; it signals an insult (ho‘olili, to mock by metaphorical disposal) now circulating throughout the population.\n\n• 'Ama'u’s fatal decision: The chief’s self-mocking riposte—“i ‘ole au e make iā ia ‘a‘ohe ona ikaika” (“unless he kills me he is not truly strong”)—parodies the heroic kaulana kū-hā-o-kū formula (“stands in the sky like a spear”), but with sarcastic fatalism. The expression shows a chief already resigned to death, an attitude consistent with late-period Waipahu traditions where 'Ama'u is a figure ridiculed in mākau-hā-nī-ʻau (hook parables) for overestimating his mana.\n\n• Esoteric numerology and akua communications: The audience hears the interchange because Nāmakaokapāo'o's supernatural ears pierce the usual boundaries of sense. Five miles (maile) is a loaded measurement: five is a kapu number of kāne forces (limb counts, konane stones, canoe lashings); the child overhears the “fivefold” insult from afar, foreshadowing that his retribution will unfold in five ritual stages. The motif of a child who hears what cannot be heard anticipates the ʻihi (sacred spies) who later serve Kalaniōpu‘u.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
