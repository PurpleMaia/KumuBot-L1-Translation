They arrived at the plains of Keahumoa and entered the house, but there was no one there. As they were preparing to leave, Nāmakaokapāo’o called out from above the rafters. They heard the voice, but could not see the body. They asked, “Where are you calling from?” Nāmakaokapāo’o replied, “I am here above.” Eight men climbed up, four to the back of the house and four to the front, and found Nāmakaokapāo’o. Nāmakaokapāo’o said, “What brings you here to this place?” They replied, “We have come to fight Nāmakaokapāo’o, a small child like you, but incredibly strong and brave, who killed his stepfather, Puali’i.”",

The arrival of ‘Ama’u’s warriors signifies a formal response to the events previously described, likely Puali’i’s death and Nāmakaokapāo’o’s disruptive actions. The scale of the force sent – four groups of forty-eight warriors each – underscores the perceived threat posed by a young boy. This is a common motif in Hawaiian moʻolelo (stories) – a seemingly insignificant individual possessing extraordinary power.\n\n– ‘Ama’u: The name ‘Ama’u (literally, “frigatebird”) is significant. Frigatebirds are known for their cunning and ability to take what others have, often stealing fish from other birds. This could be a subtle foreshadowing of ‘Ama’u’s motivations – perhaps a desire to reclaim something lost or to assert dominance. The association with Waikīkī suggests a connection to chiefly power and resources concentrated in that area.\n\n– The Warriors & Numerical Significance: The number forty-eight (kanahā kumamāwalu) is noteworthy. While not as overtly symbolic as numbers like four or seven in some Polynesian cosmologies, the repetition of this number across all four groups emphasizes the organized and deliberate nature of the attack. It suggests a calculated response rather than a spontaneous raid. The sheer number of warriors also highlights the perceived danger of Nāmakaokapāo’o, despite his youth.\n\n• The warriors’ initial search of the house and finding it empty is a classic narrative device. It builds suspense and emphasizes Nāmakaokapāo’o’s cunning and ability to remain hidden. The fact that they are about to leave when he calls out from the rafters (kaupoku) suggests he is deliberately toying with them, demonstrating his control over the situation. The rafters themselves are symbolically important – they represent the structure and support of the house, and Nāmakaokapāo’o’s position above them suggests a position of power and oversight.\n\n– The Voice & Invisibility: The warriors hear the voice but cannot see the body. This could be interpreted literally – Nāmakaokapāo’o is well-hidden – but also symbolically. It suggests a connection to the spirit world (ʻuhane) or a supernatural ability to conceal himself. This aligns with the earlier mention of his father being part god.\n\n• The dialogue between the warriors and Nāmakaokapāo’o is revealing. The warriors’ question – “What brings you here to this place?” – is a challenge, an assertion of their authority. Nāmakaokapāo’o’s response is nonchalant, almost dismissive, further emphasizing his confidence.\n\n– The Accusation & Motivation: The warriors’ accusation – that Nāmakaokapāo’o killed his stepfather, Puali’i – is the stated reason for their attack. However, the description of Nāmakaokapāo’o as “a small child like you, but incredibly strong and brave” suggests that his strength and defiance are also factors. The emphasis on Puali’i’s death is likely a key element, potentially tied to issues of inheritance, power struggles, or violations of social norms. The reference to Puali’i being killed is a direct accusation, framing Nāmakaokapāo’o as a murderer and justifying the warriors’ intent to fight him. This echoes themes found in stories from the ‘Ai Kapu era, where maintaining social order and avenging wrongs were paramount.\n\n• The division of the warriors – eight climbing up, four to the back and four to the front – demonstrates a tactical approach, attempting to surround and capture Nāmakaokapāo’o. This suggests they are not simply seeking revenge but are attempting to subdue him and bring him to justice (or, more likely, to ‘Ama’u). The successful location of Nāmakaokapāo’o sets the stage for the inevitable confrontation, which will likely be a test of his strength, cunning, and perhaps his supernatural abilities. The narrative is building towards a climax, and the encounter between Nāmakaokapāo’o and ‘Ama’u’s warriors promises to be a pivotal moment in the story. </commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
