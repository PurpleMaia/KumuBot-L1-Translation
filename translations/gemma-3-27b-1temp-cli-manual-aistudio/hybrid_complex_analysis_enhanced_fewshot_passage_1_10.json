At that time, ‘Ama'u, a chief from O'ahu, was staying in Waikīkī where he resided. A man from Honouliuli came to Waikīkī to see the chief, who was staying there. He said: “Oh chief! There is a very strong little boy, his father has died and his head was thrown far into the sea, a very long distance, five miles long. And ‘Ama'u heard this, and his strength will cause me to die from him, but if I do not die from him, he has no strength. As he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o also heard these words about him.”",

The death of Puali‘i, while abrupt, serves as a catalyst for further developments. The focus immediately shifts to Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s reaction – or lack thereof – to his stepfather’s death, specifically his refusal to eat. This is a culturally significant detail, hinting at a deeper emotional or spiritual state.\n\n– Puali‘i’s Death: The manner of Puali‘i’s death is not specified, leaving room for interpretation. It could be natural causes, an accident, or even a consequence of the earlier tensions surrounding Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s destructive behavior. The lack of detail is typical of early Hawaiian storytelling, where the how is often less important than the what and the resulting consequences.\n\n– Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s Fasting: Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s refusal to eat is a powerful symbol. In Hawaiian culture, food is deeply connected to mana (spiritual power) and life force. Refusing food can signify grief, spiritual preparation, or a rejection of the current state of affairs. Given the context of Puali‘i’s death and the impending arrival of ‘Ama‘u, this fast likely represents a period of mourning and a subconscious preparation for the challenges ahead. It could also be a sign of ‘ano‘ai – a deep, internal sense of unease or foreboding.\n\n• The introduction of ‘Ama‘u – ‘Ama-ʻu (meaning “unripe” or “not yet ready”) – a chief from O‘ahu, residing in Waikīkī, introduces a new power dynamic. The narrative structure here is typical: a report is brought to the chief, rather than the chief actively seeking information. This reinforces his status and authority.\n\n– The Messenger from Honouliuli: The man from Honouliuli serves as a conduit for information, bringing news of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s extraordinary strength and the unusual circumstances of his father’s death. The detail about the father’s head being thrown “five miles” into the sea is striking. This is likely a hyperbole, emphasizing the finality of the death and the vastness of the ocean as a symbol of the unknown. It also subtly hints at a possible violent or unnatural death, perhaps even a ritualistic one. The distance is likely symbolic, representing a complete severance from the past.\n\n– ‘Ama‘u’s Assessment of Nāmakaokapāo‘o: ‘Ama‘u’s reaction is complex. He acknowledges Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s strength but frames it as a threat to his own life. His statement, “if I do not die from him, he has no strength,” is paradoxical. It suggests that Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s power is contingent on ‘Ama‘u’s perception of it – a fascinating psychological insight. This could be interpreted as a challenge, a recognition of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s potential, or a fear of the unknown. It also subtly introduces the concept of mana being transferable or dependent on belief.\n\n• The final sentence, stating that Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard the conversation, is crucial. It establishes him as an active listener and a potential player in the unfolding events. He is now aware of ‘Ama‘u’s assessment of him, and this knowledge will undoubtedly influence his actions. This is a classic narrative device – planting the seed of conflict and anticipation.\n\n– Allegorical Interpretation: This paragraph can be read allegorically as a representation of the clash between traditional Hawaiian power structures (represented by ‘Ama‘u, the ali‘i) and a new, disruptive force (Nāmakaokapāo‘o). The death of Puali‘i could symbolize the decline of the old ways, while Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s refusal to eat represents a rejection of the established order. The five-mile distance of the father’s head thrown into the sea could symbolize a complete break from the past and a willingness to embrace the unknown. The entire passage foreshadows a struggle for dominance and a potential transformation of Hawaiian society. It’s possible this story is a veiled commentary on the increasing influence of foreign powers and the challenges to traditional Hawaiian authority during the period of increasing Western contact. </commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
