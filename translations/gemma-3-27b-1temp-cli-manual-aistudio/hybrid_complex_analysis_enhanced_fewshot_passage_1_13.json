The dialogue reveals a complex interplay of identity, power, and prophecy, all set against the backdrop of a likely struggle for chiefly authority. The setting shifts from an unspecified higher ground to a lower area, suggesting a descent into a more concrete and violent confrontation.\n\n– Nāmakaokapāo'o’s Declaration: Nāmakaokapāo'o’s statement, “Ua ‘ike au, he kanaka nui nō ‘o Nāmakaokapāo’o…,” is layered with meaning. He asserts not merely that a great person named Nāmakaokapāo'o exists, but that he is aware of this greatness and, crucially, that he embodies it. This is a claim to mana (spiritual power) and chiefly status. The reference to Ko’olau is significant. Ko’olau, the windward side of O’ahu, is often associated with strength, resilience, and ancient lineages. It’s a place of refuge and power in Hawaiian cosmology. The statement \"ʻo wau he inoa nona\" (I am a name for him) is a complex assertion. It could mean he is that great person, possessing his spirit or inheriting his legacy. Alternatively, it could be a claim that he is a vessel for that greatness, a chosen one destined to fulfill a prophecy. The repetition of the name, Nāmakaokapāo'o, emphasizes its power and importance.\n\n– The Rejection and Death Sentence: The response, “'A'ole, 'o 'oe nō…,” is a blunt rejection of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s claim. They identify him as the subject of their knowledge, not a representative of a greater figure. The phrase “pela ko makou lohe” (that is what we have heard) suggests a pre-existing narrative or accusation against him. This narrative likely paints him as a threat, justifying their death sentence. The declaration “e make ana ‘oe iā mākou, ‘a’ole ‘oe e ola” (you will die by our hand, you will not live) is a stark and unambiguous threat, indicative of a deeply entrenched conflict.\n\n– The Call to Battle: Nāmakaokapāo'o’s response, “Ho’i aku ho’i hā kākou i lalo e hakakā ai” (Let us all return down below to fight), demonstrates a willingness to engage in direct confrontation. The use of “kākou” (inclusive we) suggests he is addressing a group, perhaps those who initially questioned him, and challenging them to a duel or battle. The phrase “i lalo” (down below) could be literal, referring to a geographical descent, but also symbolic, representing a descent into a more primal and violent state.\n\n– The Decisive Victory and Sole Survivor: The description of the battle is concise but brutal: “e hao aku ana ‘o Nāmakaokapāo’o, pau loa i ka make…” (Nāmakaokapāo'o attacked, killing them all…). The verb “hao” (to attack, to rush) implies a swift and overwhelming assault. The phrase “pau loa i ka make” (completely finished with death) emphasizes the totality of his victory. The survival of only one man is a common motif in Hawaiian legends, often serving as a messenger or a link to the next stage of the story.\n\n– 'Ama'u and the Dissemination of News: The survivor’s journey to Waikīkī to find ‘Ama’u is significant. Waikīkī was a major center of power and population on O’ahu, a place where news and stories would quickly spread. ‘Ama’u, receiving the news of the massacre, represents the wider community being informed of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s power and ruthlessness. The phrase “i ‘āha’ilono” (to be astonished) highlights the shocking nature of the event. The fact that ‘Ama’u is the one to hear the news suggests he may play a crucial role in the unfolding narrative, perhaps as an advisor, a rival, or a witness to Nāmakaokapāo'o’s rise to power.\n\n• Allegorical Interpretation: This passage can be interpreted as an allegory for the dismantling of older power structures and the emergence of a new, more assertive leader. Nāmakaokapāo'o, with his claim to embody a greater force and his decisive victory, represents a challenge to the established order. The massacre could symbolize the violent overthrow of traditional authority. The survivor’s role in informing ‘Ama’u suggests the need to disseminate this new reality to the wider community. This narrative resonates with historical periods of upheaval and transition in Hawaiian society, potentially reflecting the shifts in power dynamics that occurred during the early stages of Western contact or even earlier periods of internal conflict. The name Nāmakaokapāo'o – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) – could symbolize a keen observer, a strategist, or someone who sees things others do not, allowing him to anticipate and overcome his enemies. The pāo'o fish itself is known for its ability to navigate murky waters, suggesting Nāmakaokapāo'o’s cunning and adaptability. </commentary>",

So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
