Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nThen, he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. And when his mother was gone, he returned to their house in Keahumoa and sat down. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the ridgepole of the house, opened the thatching of the roof at the back and front, and lay down in the opening directly on top of the ridgepole.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 11:**\n• This paragraph marks a shift in the narrative, focusing on Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s actions following his stepfather Puali’i’s threat. The act of hiding his mother and then returning to the house is significant, demonstrating a level of agency and perhaps a nascent plan forming in the young boy’s mind. The location of Waipouli is key – a cave provides a natural place for concealment, suggesting a deliberate attempt to protect Pōka’ī from Puali’i’s wrath.\n– *Waipouli* (wai-pouli) translates to “dark water” or “dark spring.” Caves were often considered sacred spaces in Hawaiian cosmology, *wahi pana* (sacred places), and associated with ancestral spirits and the realm of the gods. Choosing a cave named “dark water” could symbolize a descent into the hidden, spiritual world, or a seeking of protection from unseen forces.\n• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s subsequent action of climbing onto the *kaupoku* (ridgepole) of the house and dismantling the roof is particularly striking. The *kaupoku* is a crucial structural element, representing the spine or backbone of the house.\n– *Kaupoku* is formed from *kau* (to place, to set) and *poku* (center, middle, summit). It’s the central beam supporting the roof, and therefore, the entire structure. To tamper with it is to destabilize the home, both physically and symbolically.\n• The act of opening the *mau'u* (thatching) – the woven material forming the roof – and lying *in* the opening, directly on the *kaupoku*, is a complex gesture.\n– *Mau'u* is derived from *mau* (to be steadfast, to persist) and *ʻu* (to close, to cover). Removing it exposes the interior to the elements, but also creates a vantage point.\n– Lying *on* the *kaupoku* itself is a bold act. It could be interpreted as a claim of power, a deliberate disruption of the household order, or a symbolic attempt to become one with the structure of the home. It’s a vulnerable position, exposed to the sky, but also a position of control, overseeing the entire space.\n• This behavior is unusual for a young child and suggests a deeper, perhaps even supernatural, intelligence at play. It echoes the behavior of trickster figures in Hawaiian mythology who often challenge established norms and disrupt the status quo.\n– Considering the context of the previous paragraphs, where Puali’i threatened violence and expressed a desire to consume Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, this act could be a form of defiance, a refusal to be controlled or consumed. It’s a symbolic rejection of Puali’i’s authority and a reassertion of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s own agency.\n• The phrase “noho ihola” (sat down) after returning to the house is deceptively simple. It suggests a calm acceptance of the situation, a deliberate settling into a new state of being. This contrasts sharply with the disruptive act that follows, creating a sense of unsettling duality.\n• The overall scene evokes a sense of impending change and disruption. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s actions are not merely childish mischief; they are deliberate acts with symbolic weight, foreshadowing a potential conflict and a challenge to the established order within the household and potentially beyond. This could be an allegorical representation of the dismantling of traditional 'Ai Kapu structures, with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o representing a force of change and Puali’i embodying the old ways. The exposed roof and vulnerable position on the ridgepole symbolize the fragility of the old order and the risks inherent in embracing a new path. </commentary>",

Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
