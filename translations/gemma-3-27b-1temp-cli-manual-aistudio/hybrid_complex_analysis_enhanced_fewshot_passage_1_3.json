  "gemma-3-27b-1temp-cli-manual-aistudio_translation": "While they were living, Puali'i, a good man from Līhu'e, came down to fish at Honouliuli, and paid a visit to the house of Pōka'ī. Puali'i looked at Pōka'ī and desired her, and said: “I want you to be my wife.” Pōka'ī replied: “How could you possibly want me? I have already given birth to a child, and my body is ruined.” Puali'i said: “Those things are nothing. If you want me, let us sleep together.” Pōka'ī agreed. And Pōka'ī went with her husband and Puali'i to the plains of Keahumoa, to live.",
  "gemma-3-27b-1temp-cli-manual-aistudio_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**\n\n\n• This paragraph details the initial courtship and subsequent relocation of Pōka'ī and her family, introducing Puali'i as a significant new character. The narrative subtly reveals societal norms surrounding desire, perceived flaws, and the establishment of relationships within a traditional Hawaiian context.\n\n– Character Introduction: Puali'i – The name Pua-(a)li'i (flower/descendant of a chief) suggests a connection to chiefly lineage, even if he is described simply as a “good man.” The use of “maika’i” (good) is a common descriptor, but within the context of a potential suitor, it implies not only moral character but also suitability and desirability. He originates from Līhu'e, a district on Kaua'i, and engages in lawai'a (fishing) at Honouliuli, establishing him as a provider and connected to the resources of the land and sea. His journey to Honouliuli and subsequent visit to Pōka'ī’s home are significant, reflecting the common practice of travel and interaction between ahupua'a (land divisions).\n\n– Pōka'ī’s Hesitation and Societal Expectations – Pōka'ī’s response to Puali'i’s proposal is crucial. Her statement, “Pehea ‘oe e makemake ai ia‘u? Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino,” (How could you possibly want me? I have already given birth to a child, and my body is ruined) reveals a deeply ingrained sense of self-perception influenced by societal expectations. The term “’ino’ino” (ruined, defiled) suggests a cultural understanding of childbirth as potentially diminishing a woman’s physical attractiveness or desirability. This highlights the pressures placed upon women regarding their bodies and their roles within the community. It’s important to note this doesn’t necessarily indicate Pōka’ī believes she is ruined, but rather is articulating the likely societal judgment she anticipates.\n\n– Puali'i’s Reassurance and the Pragmatic Approach to Relationships – Puali'i’s response, “He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua,” (Those things are nothing. If you want me, let us sleep together) is strikingly direct. It demonstrates a pragmatic approach to relationships, prioritizing mutual desire over perceived physical imperfections. This isn’t necessarily a callous disregard for Pōka'ī’s feelings, but rather a straightforward expression of his attraction and a willingness to bypass societal constraints. The phrase “e moe kāua” (let us sleep together) is a euphemism for establishing a long-term relationship, encompassing not just physical intimacy but also a commitment to shared life.\n\n– Relocation to Keahumoa and its Significance – The final sentence, “A ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘ī me kāna kāne me Puali‘i ā ke kula o Keahumoa, noho,” (And Pōka'ī went with her husband and Puali'i to the plains of Keahumoa, to live) is particularly telling. The inclusion of “kāna kāne” (her husband) alongside Puali'i suggests a complex dynamic. It’s unclear if this is a formal acknowledgement of a polygamous relationship, a transitional period, or a nuanced way of acknowledging the existing familial ties. Keahumoa (heap of chickens) is a place name on Kaua'i, and the act of relocating signifies a shift in Pōka'ī’s life and a commitment to a new future with Puali'i. The “noho” (to live, to dwell) at the end emphasizes the establishment of a new household and a new chapter in their lives.\n\n• Contextualizing within the 'Ai Kapu Era: While the narrative doesn’t explicitly mention the 'Ai Kapu system, the societal pressures surrounding female desirability and the pragmatic approach to relationships can be understood within that historical context. The 'Ai Kapu era (roughly 1100-1819) was characterized by strict social hierarchies and kapu (sacred laws) that governed all aspects of life. While relationships were often based on lineage and political alliances, personal desire and pragmatic considerations also played a role. Pōka'ī’s hesitation and Puali'i’s directness reflect the tensions between traditional expectations and individual agency within that system. The relocation to Keahumoa could also be interpreted as a move to a new ahupua'a to establish a new social standing and potentially escape the constraints of their previous community.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
