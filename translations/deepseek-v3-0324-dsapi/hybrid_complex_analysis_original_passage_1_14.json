  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard [the news], he prepared his eighteen war canoes and sailed down to 'Ewa to battle Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u and his men arrived at 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o was relentlessly destroying everything until not a single person remained, and 'Ama'u perished. Nāmakaokapāo'o then took control of all of O'ahu. Afterward, he sent for his mother and established her as ruler over the land of O'ahu.",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>  \nWhen 'Ama'u heard [the news], he prepared his eighteen war canoes and sailed down to 'Ewa to battle Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u and his men arrived at 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o was relentlessly destroying everything until not a single person remained, and 'Ama'u perished.

Afterward, he sent for his mother and established her as ruler over the land of O'ahu.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a larger historical or legendary narrative recounting conflicts over sovereignty on O'ahu. It depicts a pivotal battle between two chiefs ('Ama'u and Nāmakaokapāo'o), highlighting themes of conquest, leadership succession, and the consolidation of power. Such accounts were often preserved in Hawaiian oral traditions and later recorded in written form, serving as both history and political legitimization for ruling lineages.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
