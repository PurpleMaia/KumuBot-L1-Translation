  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_translation": "When Pualiʻi died, Nāmakaokapāoʻo returned to his mother, Pōkaʻī, and they lived together, but Nāmakaokapāoʻo had no food to eat. At that time, ʻAmaʻu, a chief of Oʻahu, was residing at Waikīkī. A man from Honouliuli came to Waikīkī where the chief was staying and said: \"O chief! There is a remarkable small child who is very strong. His father has died, and his head was thrown far out to sea—a very great distance, five miles long.\" When ʻAmaʻu heard this, he thought, \"His strength will be the death of me, but if I do not die by his hand, he has no strength.\" While this was being spoken at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāoʻo heard these words about himself.",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>  \nWhen Pualiʻi died, Nāmakaokapāoʻo returned to his mother, Pōkaʻī, and they lived together, but Nāmakaokapāoʻo had no food to eat.

The excerpt introduces themes of strength, prophecy, and rivalry, common in Hawaiian heroic traditions. The mention of ʻAmaʻu, a chief of Oʻahu, situates the story in a specific geographic and political context, hinting at intergenerational or interpersonal conflicts central to the narrative. The reference to Waikīkī and Honouliuli anchors the tale in real locations, blending history with legend.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
