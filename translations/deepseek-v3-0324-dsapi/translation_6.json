  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",

Hina was from Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe came from Kuaihelani and found Hina on Kauai; they slept together, and after some time, Hina became pregnant. At that time, Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani, saying to Hina: \"Listen, I am returning; stay here, and if you bear a son, name him after me; if you bear a daughter, name her Laukiamanuikahiki. Raise the child until grown, and if you wish to come seek me, here are the signs: a palaoa lei, a kupee bracelet, an ahuula feather cloak, a large canoe, a small canoe, a large man, a small man, a red canoe, a red sail, a red mast, a red paddle, a red man.\" Makiioeoe then returned to Kuaihelani, instructing the guardians about the nature of the daughter, and planting all things for Laukiamanuikahiki, the sacred pools and other things, all made sacred or free for Laukiamanuikahiki.  \n</translation>"
