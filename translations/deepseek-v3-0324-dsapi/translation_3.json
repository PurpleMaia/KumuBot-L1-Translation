  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_translation": "Here is the English translation of the Hawaiian text:\n\n<translation>On the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele climbed to the place of the koa tree canoe, where the birds called, carrying the hokeo ie. When they arrived right beneath the trunk of that koa tree, Kauakahi sat apart with the hokeo ie. At that moment, Keawenuiaumi's canoe carvers cut the base of the koa tree, and the birds landed, calling out: \"Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, only a hollow. A bad canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe unfit for the ocean.\"</translation>"
