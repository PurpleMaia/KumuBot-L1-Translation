All the children saw him and ran away, standing at a distance out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: \"Hey! Here is the sharp knife in my hand, a tool to cut off your head today. When your head is severed, then roast it with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat first, and then it will be free (noa).\" Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not listen to these words of Puali‘i, so Puali‘i spoke again, the second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the sharp knife when Nāmakaokapāo‘o prayed his death prayer for Puali‘i. His prayer went like this:  \n\n*\"Alas, the face of my dear little companion,*  \n*Twisted, contorted it appears,*  \n*Perhaps to eat, perhaps to leave,*  \n*Perhaps to leave to Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,*  \n*That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,*  \n*This is my dear friend,*  \n*Nāmakaokai‘a, the great chief of Hawai‘i,*  \n*Flee, flee the mere braggart,*  \n*Men with spears,*  \n*Spears with shields,*  \n*Death comes to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.\"*",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_commentary": "### **Cultural Context:**  \n1. **Conflict and Power Dynamics:**  \n   - This passage depicts a tense confrontation between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, reflecting traditional Hawaiian themes of rivalry, mana (spiritual power), and the assertion of dominance. The threat of decapitation and cannibalism (symbolic or literal) is a recurring motif in Hawaiian mo‘olelo (stories), often representing the ultimate subjugation of an enemy.  \n   - The phrase *\"a laila, noa\"* (\"then it will be free\") suggests the lifting of a kapu (taboo) after the act, indicating ritual significance.  \n\n2. **The Role of Pule (Prayer):**  \n   - Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s *pule make* (death prayer) is a last resort, invoking spiritual forces to curse his opponent. The prayer is poetic and structured, calling upon ancestral and divine connections (e.g., *Nāmakaokai‘a, the great chief of Hawai‘i*).  \n   - The prayer’s imagery (*\"twisted, contorted\"*) may symbolize the distortion of fate or the enemy’s impending doom.  \n\n3. **Food Symbolism:**  \n   - The mention of roasting sweet potatoes (*‘uala*) alongside the severed head blurs the line between sustenance and sacrifice, possibly alluding to ceremonial offerings or the dehumanization of the enemy.  \n\n### **Linguistic Features:**  \n1. **Verbal Directness:**  \n   - Puali‘i’s speech is abrupt and threatening, using imperatives (*\"‘Ē!\"*) and vivid, violent imagery (*\"moku kō po‘o\"* – \"your head will be severed\"). This reflects traditional Hawaiian oratory in confrontational contexts.  \n\n2. **Poetic Structure of the Prayer:**  \n   - The prayer employs parallelism (*\"E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha\"* – \"Perhaps to eat, perhaps to leave\") and name repetitions (*Kukui‘aimakaokalani*), common in Hawaiian chant and prayer to reinforce intent.  \n   - The phrase *\"E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale\"* (\"Flee, flee the mere braggart\") uses reduplication (*he‘e*) for emphasis, a common poetic device.  \n\n3. **Possessive and Honorifics:**  \n   - The use of *ku‘u wahi aikāne* (\"my dear friend\") contrasts with the hostility, possibly indicating irony or a deeper, pre-existing relationship between the two figures.  \n\n### **Historical Significance:**  \n1. **Connection to Chiefly Conflicts:**  \n   - The reference to *Nāmakaokai‘a* as the *ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i* (high chief of Hawai‘i) suggests this passage may be tied to historical chiefly rivalries, possibly from the era of island unification. Such stories often served as political allegories.  \n\n2. **Survival of Oral Tradition:**  \n   - The preservation of this passage, likely from a larger mo‘olelo, highlights the importance of storytelling in maintaining Hawaiian history, values, and language. The rhythmic, chant-like quality of the prayer indicates its origins in oral performance.  \n\n3. **Themes of Fate and Justice:**  \n   - The prayer’s closing line (*\"Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o\"* – \"Death comes to Nāmakaokapāo‘o\") suggests an inevitability, possibly reflecting the Hawaiian belief in predestined outcomes (*kilo*) or divine retribution.  \n\nThis passage is a rich example of how Hawaiian language, culture, and history intertwine in narrative form, offering insights into warfare, spirituality, and social hierarchy in pre-contact Hawai‘i.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
