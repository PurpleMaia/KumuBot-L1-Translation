Pōka‘ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his own land. Pōka‘ī remained with her pregnancy, and later, she gave birth. At the time of this birth, Pōka‘ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were very poor.",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_commentary": "### **Cultural Context**  \n1. **Place Significance (‘Āina):**  \n   - The mention of *Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa* (Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa) situates this narrative in the ‘Ewa district of O‘ahu, a region historically rich in agricultural and cultural importance. ‘Ewa was known for its fertile lands and freshwater springs, making it a vital area for Hawaiian settlement.  \n   - Place names (*inoa ‘āina*) in Hawaiian traditions often carry deep genealogical and spiritual significance, anchoring stories to specific locations.  \n\n2. **Conception and Lineage:**  \n   - The phrase *launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana* (\"physically united through sleeping together\") reflects traditional Hawaiian descriptions of conception, which are often indirect and poetic, emphasizing the sacred nature of procreation.  \n   - The child’s name, *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*, likely holds genealogical importance, as Hawaiian names frequently reference ancestors, deities, or natural elements.  \n\n3. **Poverty (‘Ilhune):**  \n   - The mention of Pōka‘ī and her child being *‘ilihune loa* (\"very poor\") highlights themes of struggle and resilience, common in Hawaiian mo‘olelo (stories). Poverty in this context may also signify a period of hardship before a rise in status, a narrative trope in many indigenous traditions.  \n\n### **Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Verbal Nuances:**  \n   - *Launa kino* (\"physically united\") is a euphemistic phrase for intimacy, demonstrating the Hawaiian preference for indirect yet vivid language.  \n   - *Hāpai* (\"to carry\" or \"to become pregnant\") is still used in modern Hawaiian to mean pregnancy, showing linguistic continuity.  \n\n2. **Possessive Markers:**  \n   - The use of *kāna keiki* (\"her child\") with the possessive *kāna* (his/hers) reflects the Hawaiian grammatical structure where possession is explicitly marked, emphasizing relational ties.  \n\n3. **Temporal Sequencing:**  \n   - The passage uses sequential verbs (*ho‘i akula*, *noho ihola*, *hānau*) to create a flowing narrative, a hallmark of Hawaiian storytelling that prioritizes action and consequence.  \n\n### **Historical Significance**  \n1. **Genealogical Record:**  \n   - This passage likely comes from a mo‘olelo (historical narrative) or mo‘okū‘auhau (genealogy), serving to preserve the lineage of a family or chief. The mention of specific names and places would have been crucial for oral historians (*kākā‘ōlelo*).  \n\n2. **Social Structure:**  \n   - The separation of Kauluakaha‘i (returning to his land) and Pōka‘ī (remaining with her child) may reflect traditional Hawaiian familial roles, where fathers often had responsibilities tied to their own lineages or lands.  \n\n3. **Themes of Struggle and Resilience:**  \n   - The poverty of Pōka‘ī and her child may foreshadow a later rise in status, a common motif in Hawaiian narratives where hardship precedes greatness (e.g., the story of ‘Umi).  \n\nThis passage is a rich example of how Hawaiian language and storytelling intertwine to convey cultural values, historical memory, and familial connections. The careful choice of words and place names ensures that the mo‘olelo remains rooted in both the physical and spiritual landscape of Hawai‘i.",

When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",
