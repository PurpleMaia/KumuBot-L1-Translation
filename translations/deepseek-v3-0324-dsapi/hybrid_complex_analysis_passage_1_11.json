Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed to the ridgepole of the house, removed the grass thatching from the back and front, and lay down directly atop the ridgepole.",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>  \nThen, he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. After his mother disappeared, he returned to their house at Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed to the ridgepole of the house, removed the grass thatching from the back and front, and lay down directly atop the ridgepole.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a larger Hawaiian narrative, likely a moʻolelo (story or history), involving the figure Nāmakaokapāo'o. The actions described—hiding his mother in a cave and altering the house's thatching—suggest a pivotal moment in the story, possibly tied to themes of secrecy, transformation, or ritual. The specific place names (Waipouli, Keahumoa) anchor the events in a real or legendary Hawaiian landscape, emphasizing the connection between narrative and ʻāina (land).  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
