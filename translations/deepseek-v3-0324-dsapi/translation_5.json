  "reference_translation": "This call and reply was repeated twice before the guards heard it, when they sat up and listened to the call and they understood the meaning conveyed by the owl in its call. At this one of the guards said to his companion: “Say, this must be Laukiamanuikahiki, the king’s own daughter.” The other replied: “No, this cannot be the one, for she was to come in a red canoe having red sails, red paddles, red men, a large canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men; these I understand are the things that should accompany her; this girl on the other hand is a poor girl for she has come without any of these things.” The two again listened to the conversation between the owl and girl. After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter. They arrived at the home of Makiioeoe after midnight and roused him up saying: “Say, you wake up.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “There is an owl right over the pig house where the girl is held who called out to the girl in the following way:",

One said to the other: \"Eh, perhaps this is the daughter of the chief, Laukiamanuikahiki.\" The other replied: \"No, that is not her; her canoe is red, her sail is red, her paddle is red, her crew is red, a large canoe, a small canoe, a long canoe, a large man, a small man—that is her nature when she comes. This is not the poor girl.\" They listened again to the words of the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki. \"Let us go up and speak to the chief, lest this girl be taken.\" One agreed. \"Yes.\" They arrived before Makiioeoe the chief, in the middle of the night, and roused him: \"Here, wake up.\" \"What is it?\" said Makiioeoe. \"An owl is right above the door where the girl is confined. These are the words of the owl that we heard calling down to the girl.\"  \n</translation>"
