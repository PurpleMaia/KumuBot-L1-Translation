  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession.",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_translation": "Here is the English translation of the Hawaiian text:\n\n<translation>\nWaiakea in Hilo is the land, Halepaki is the father, and Wailea is the mother. Wailea also has a younger sibling, Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala. Kaipalaoa was born and grew up; his father went to Kauai and was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a sacred chief of Kauai, a chief skilled in riddling, who struck this bone of men, Halepaiwi, a small remaining place entirely surrounded by this bone of men. Halepaki indeed knew riddling and was taught, but he was not deeply learned; he sailed to Kauai and was killed by Kalanialiiloa. Pueonuiokona was the chief of Kauai.\n</translation>"
