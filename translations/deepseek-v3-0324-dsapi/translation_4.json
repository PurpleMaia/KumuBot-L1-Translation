  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_translation": "Here is the English translation of the Hawaiian text:\n\n<translation>  \nIn the middle of the night, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. Yet this was the reason it came. The mother looked at her daughter and said: \"Indeed, we are the beloved ones of the bone and blood, not your father of the boneless and bloodless.\" Pumaia replied: \"What are you two murmuring about?\" \"Nothing, we are just speaking idly of death, not of you, the boneless and bloodless one.\" Pumaia then said to the woman: \"Let us go; open [the way] for me and take me with you.\" They ascended from Pukoula to the uplands of Pauoa, traveling until they reached the waters of Alekoki, and from there to Maemae. Thus they climbed until the breaking of dawn, when they arrived at Nuuanu.  \n</translation>"
