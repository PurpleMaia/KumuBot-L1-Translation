All the children saw and ran to stand at a distance out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: \"Hey! Here is the sharp knife in my hand, a tool to cut off your head today. When your head is severed, then roast it with the sweet potato, and I will eat first, then it will be free (noa).\" Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not listen to these words of Puali‘i, so Puali‘i spoke again, the second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut down Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the sharp knife, and at that moment, Nāmakaokapāo‘o prayed his death prayer for Puali‘i. The prayer went like this:  \n\n*Beloved is the face of my little companion,*  \n*Twisted, contorted it lies,*  \n*Perhaps to eat, perhaps to leave,*  \n*Perhaps to leave to Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,*  \n*That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,*  \n*This is my dear friend,*  \n*Nāmakaokai‘a, the great chief of Hawai‘i,*  \n*Slip away, slip away the mere whisper,*  \n*Men with spears,*  \n*Spears with shields,*  \n*Death comes to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.*",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_commentary": "### **Cultural Context:**  \n1. **Conflict and Power Dynamics:**  \n   - This passage depicts a tense confrontation between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, highlighting traditional Hawaiian concepts of authority, retribution, and the supernatural. The threat of decapitation and cannibalism (symbolic or literal) reflects the high stakes of chiefly conflicts in Hawaiian history.  \n   - The phrase *\"a laila, noa\"* (\"then it will be free\") suggests the lifting of a kapu (taboo) after the act, indicating ritual significance in the violence.  \n\n2. **The Role of Prayer (Pule Make – Death Prayer):**  \n   - Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s *pule make* is a powerful cultural element, demonstrating the Hawaiian belief in the spoken word’s mana (spiritual power). Such prayers were believed to manifest reality, especially in life-or-death situations.  \n   - The prayer invokes ancestral and divine forces (*Nāmakaokai‘a*, a great chief, and *Kukui‘aimakaokalani*, possibly a deified ancestor or guardian). The imagery of twisting (*hapupu‘u*) and contortion may symbolize the intended fate of Puali‘i.  \n\n3. **Symbolism of Food (ʻUala – Sweet Potato):**  \n   - The roasting of sweet potatoes (*ʻuala*) alongside the threat of cannibalism ties into Hawaiian narratives where food and violence intersect (e.g., in the legend of ʻUmi, where food offerings signify loyalty or betrayal).  \n\n### **Linguistic Features:**  \n1. **Poetic Diction in the Prayer:**  \n   - The prayer employs parallelism (*\"E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale\"*) and repetition (*\"E waiho paha\"*), common in Hawaiian chant and oral tradition.  \n   - Metaphorical language (*\"E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei\"*) conveys physical and spiritual distortion, possibly foreshadowing Puali‘i’s downfall.  \n\n2. **Grammatical Nuances:**  \n   - The imperative *\"ʻĒ!\"* (\"Hey!\") is a confrontational opener, emphasizing Puali‘i’s aggression.  \n   - The phrase *\"he mea ʻoʻoki no kō poʻo\"* (\"a tool to cut off your head\") uses the possessive *kō* (your) to personalize the threat.  \n\n3. **Use of Noa:**  \n   - *Noa* (free from kapu) implies ritual purification post-violence, a concept central to Hawaiian religious practices.  \n\n### **Historical Significance:**  \n1. **Chiefly Warfare and Retribution:**  \n   - The passage mirrors historical accounts of rival chiefs settling disputes through combat or supernatural means. The invocation of *Nāmakaokai‘a* (possibly a reference to the goddess Nāmaka or a high-ranking chief) situates the conflict within a lineage-based power struggle.  \n\n2. **Oral Tradition and Preservation:**  \n   - This narrative likely originates from moʻolelo (histories) passed down orally. The inclusion of a prayer suggests it was preserved for its spiritual and didactic value, teaching lessons about hubris and divine justice.  \n\n3. **Connection to Broader Pacific Themes:**  \n   - The motif of decapitation and cannibalism appears in other Polynesian traditions (e.g., Māori, Tahitian), indicating shared cultural themes around warfare and mana.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nThis passage is a rich example of Hawaiian oral literature, blending violence, spirituality, and poetic language. It offers insights into pre-contact Hawaiian societal norms, the power of language (pule), and the enduring significance of moʻolelo in preserving history and identity.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
