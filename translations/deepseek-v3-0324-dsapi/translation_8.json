  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”",

It is a canoe. Beat the tapa into an outrigger, put it inside the gourd—is that not an outrigger? It is an outrigger. Catch a fish to serve as a float, put it inside the gourd—is that not a float? It is a float.\"\n</translation>"
