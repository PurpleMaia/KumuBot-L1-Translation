Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and desired her, saying: \"I desire you to be my wife.\" Pōka‘ī replied: \"How can you desire me? I have borne a child, and my body is undesirable.\" Puali‘i said: \"Those things do not matter; if you desire me, let us sleep together.\" Pōka‘ī consented. And Pōka‘ī returned with her husband Puali‘ī to the plain of Keahumoa, where they lived.",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-dsapi_commentary": "**Cultural Context:**\n1. **Gender and Courtship:** This passage reflects traditional Hawaiian attitudes toward courtship and relationships. Puali‘i’s direct proposal (\"Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u\") aligns with the Hawaiian cultural norm of straightforward communication in matters of love and desire, contrasting with Western notions of courtship that often involve prolonged subtlety. Pōka‘ī’s initial hesitation due to having borne a child and feeling \"‘ino‘ino\" (undesirable) hints at societal expectations around female purity, though Puali‘i’s dismissal of these concerns suggests flexibility in Hawaiian views on marriage and partnership.\n\n2. **Place and Identity:** The mention of specific locations (Līhu‘e, Honouliuli, Keahumoa) grounds the narrative in real Hawaiian geography, emphasizing the importance of place (ʻāina) in Hawaiian identity. Puali‘i is identified by his origin (Līhu‘e), which was common in Hawaiian storytelling to establish a person’s background and connections.\n\n3. **Sexual and Marital Norms:** The phrase \"e moe kāua\" (let us sleep together) is a euphemism for sexual relations, reflecting the Hawaiian cultural comfort with discussing intimacy openly. Pōka‘ī’s autonomy in consenting (\"‘Ae akula\") highlights the agency women could exercise in relationships, contrary to colonial-era stereotypes of passive Polynesian women.\n\n**Linguistic Features:**\n1. **Verbal Directionals:** The passage uses directional particles like \"maila\" (toward the speaker) and \"akula\" (away from the speaker) to indicate movement and perspective. For example, \"iho maila\" (came down toward) and \"‘ī aku\" (said away) subtly convey spatial relationships.\n\n2. **Possessive Markers:** The use of \"ko‘u kino\" (my body) with the \"o\"-class possessive (\"ko‘u\") implies an inherent, unchangeable relationship, which contrasts with \"kāna kāne\" (her husband), where the \"a\"-class possessive (\"kāna\") suggests an acquired relationship. This distinction is grammatically significant in Hawaiian.\n\n3. **Negation and Dismissal:** Puali‘i’s phrase \"He mea ‘ole ia mau mea\" (Those things are nothing) employs the neutral pronoun \"he mea\" to downplay Pōka‘ī’s concerns, a common rhetorical strategy in Hawaiian persuasion.\n\n**Historical Significance:**\n1. **Pre-Christian Morality:** The interaction predates Christian missionary influence, as evidenced by the lack of shame around premarital childbirth and the pragmatic view of partnership. This contrasts with later 19th-century Hawaiian literature, which often reflects Puritanical values.\n\n2. **Oral Tradition:** The concise yet vivid dialogue is characteristic of Hawaiian moʻolelo (stories) designed for oral performance. The rhythmic repetition of \"makemake\" (desire) and the quick resolution mirror traditional storytelling techniques.\n\n3. **Social Mobility:** Puali‘i’s acceptance of Pōka‘ī despite her past suggests that Hawaiian society allowed for social flexibility, where personal merit (\"he kanaka maika‘i\"—a good man) could outweigh rigid social judgments.\n\nThis passage offers a window into pre-contact Hawaiian relational dynamics, linguistic richness, and the interplay of place, identity, and autonomy in traditional narratives.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
