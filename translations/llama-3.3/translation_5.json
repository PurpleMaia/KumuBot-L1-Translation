  "llama-3.3_translation": "<translation>\nTwo servants were working, and they heard the voices, and when they listened, they understood the words of the owl. One said to the other, \"Perhaps this is the chief's daughter, Laukiamanuikahiki.\" The other said, \"No, it's not; her canoe is red, her paddle is red, her oar is red, her people are red, she has big canoes, small canoes, long canoes, tall people, and short people, that's how she travels, and this is not the timid girl.\" They listened again to the words of the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki. \"Let's not speak to the chief, this must be the girl.\" One agreed, \"Yes.\" They arrived before Chief Makiioeoe at the door, and said, \"Here she is, wake up.\" \"What is it?\" asked Makiioeoe. \"There's an owl perched on top of the bundle where the girl is sitting.

After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter. They arrived at the home of Makiioeoe after midnight and roused him up saying: “Say, you wake up.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “There is an owl right over the pig house where the girl is held who called out to the girl in the following way:"
