  "llama-3.3_translation": "<translation>\nFor the big feast of Pikoiakaalala, he invited all the people, and when they arrived, he went to his sisters and the pig and the food were ready. Before they ate, Pikoiakaalala said: \"Listen, all of you, I have a rule for eating, which is: 'No talking, no joking, no burping, no sneezing, no coughing, and my feast will be finished.' He then served the pig, one piece, and the sweet potato, one piece, and the fish, and served again until the pig and all the food from the oven were gone. Someone said: \"The food is from God.\" This was ignored. The servants asked: \"Will the feast be stopped because of what happened while eating?\" \"No, it's already been eaten.\" \"Yes, we heard your rule,\" said the servants. At this feast of Pikoiakaalala, his body grew and he became a big and handsome man, but his hair remained the same, wild hair.\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair."
