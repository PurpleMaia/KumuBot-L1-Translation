At that time, Nāmakaokapāoʻo's physical form was extremely small—two and a half feet tall—and his sickness was not under control; it hung limply. When they reached the sweet potato field, he commanded the children: \"Pull up the entire sweet potato hill by the leaves until all are fully up; do not leave any growing.\" However, the children were afraid, so they handled the sweet potatoes gently and did not pull up the hills.",

Cultural Context**  \n- **Sweet Potato ('Uala) Significance**: Sweet potato was a staple crop in traditional Hawaiian agriculture ('ahupuaʻa system), deeply tied to survival and protocol. Fields required communal labor, reflecting the Hawaiian value of kōkua (mutual assistance). Pualiʻi's land access implies his status as a konohiki (land steward) or aliʻi (chief), while the children's labor illustrates collective responsibility.  \n- **Illness and Disability**: Nāmakaokapāoʻo's \"sickness hanging limply\" (e lewalewa ana nō) may reference severe disability or spiritual ailment. In Hawaiian cosmology, physical conditions were often linked to mana (spiritual power) imbalance or kapu (taboo) violations, impacting one's societal role. His authority despite disability suggests complex status interpretation—possibly divine favor or chiefly rank overriding physical limitations.  \n- **Harvesting Protocol**: The command to pull \"entire hills by the leaves\" reflects traditional practices: leaves indicated tuber maturity, while \"leave none growing\" emphasized sustainability (clearing land for replanting cycles). The children's fear may stem from kapu around disturbing the land or fear of Pualiʻi’s wrath for damaging crops—showcasing social hierarchies.  \n\n**2.

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
