By attributing the name \"Nāmakaokapāo'o\" to the sweet potato patches, the land becomes an archive of personal history. This mirrors how *wahi pana* (storied places) perpetuate ancestral legacies, functionally fusing identity ('inoa) with 'āina.  \n– The 'elua māla 'ua (two elongated patches) suggests sacred geometry—'2' in Hawaiian numerology often denotes balance (e.g., male/female in creation chants like Kumulipo). Their elongation ('lō'ihi') evokes ritual planting traditions for chiefly sustenance.  \n\n• **Puali'i's 'Ōlelo Ho'ohiki (Solemn Oath):**  \n– The vow establishes a strict **'Ai Kapu protocol**: Puali'i must consume the ritual meal (*kālua po'o ulua me ka 'uala*) before others can eat. This hierarchy reflects the **kapu noho** system where men purified food for gods before female consumption. The sequence:  \n1. Consecration: \"*Aia ā kālua*\" (When baked—earth oven cooking sanctifies the offering)  \n2. Priestly Consumption: \"*ʻai ʻo Puali‘i*\" (Puali'i eats as proxy for the gods)  \n3. *Noa* Release: Spiritual restriction lifts (*noa*), allowing *Pōkaʻī to eat*.  \n– The *ulua po'o* (head of ulua fish) symbolically replaces human sacrifice due to linguistic magic: *ulua* means both prize fish and \"to increase/grow\" (cf. Pukui & Elbert, 1986:369), while *po'o* (head) signified the most *mana*-charged part.  \n\n• **Allegorical Contestation of 'Ai Kapu:**  \n– The \"fish + sweet potato\" pairing inversely foreshadows the preceding passage where Puali'i *threatens* to eat Nāmakaokapāo'o's *po'o* and *maka* (symbolic equivalents). Here Puali'i insists on traditional order, while Nāmakaokapāo'o's later destruction of the crops (para.6) encodes rebellion against rigid kapu structures. This duality represents:  \n– *Ka Wā Mamua* (Past): Puali'i's adherence to sacrificial protocols.  \n– *Ka Wā Mahope* (Future): Nāmakaokapāo'o dismantles exploitative agriculture—the *40 mounds* in para.6 hinting at wasted abundance under kapu.  \n\n• **Spatial Symbolism of Honouliuli:**  \n– Fishing at \"*kai o Honouliuli*\" ties the ritual to specific geography. Honouliuli (Deep/Concealed Bay) in 'Ewa was a historic fishing ground layered with dual meanings:  \n– Physical Abundance: Ulua thrive in murky deeps.  \n– Cosmological Shadows: *Pō* (darkness) as realm of Kāne, progenitor gods. Puali'i's quest here roots his vow in primordial power dynamics.  \n\n• **Etymological & Genealogical Resonance:**  \n– \"Nāmakaokapāo'o\" is fragmented:  \n* *Nā-maka-o-* (The eyes of)  \n* *ka-pāo'o* [lit. the *pāo'o* fish, poetically *po'o* (head)].  \nThe name thus prefigures the \"head/eyes\" conflict. Puali'is journey to Kapolei (*lewa iluna*—upper sky zone) in para.6 mirrors Kauluakaha'i's celestial origin (*Kahikipapaia-lewa*—stratum in the sky) in para.1, suggesting intergenerational cosmological tension.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
