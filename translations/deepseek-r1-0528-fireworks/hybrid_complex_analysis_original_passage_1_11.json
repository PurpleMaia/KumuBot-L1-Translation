Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed atop the ridgepole of the house, removed the thatch from the back and front, and lay down directly in the center of the ridgepole.",
  "deepseek-r1-0528-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n### Translation\n<translation>  \nThen, he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. Once his mother was concealed, he returned to their home at Keahumoa and remained there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed atop the ridgepole of the house, removed the thatch from the back and front, and lay down directly in the center of the ridgepole.  \n</translation>  \n\n### Commentary  \n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a larger narrative from the traditional Hawaiian epic *Moolelo o Kekūhaupiʻo* (The Story of Kekūhaupiʻo). It depicts a scene where the priest-warrior Nāmakaokapāo'o undertakes ritual actions—concealing his mother for protection and ascending his house's ridgepole—to prepare for an impending conflict with his brother, Kekūhaupiʻo. This section illustrates themes of familial duty, spiritual preparation, and sacred Hawaiian architecture (hale).  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
