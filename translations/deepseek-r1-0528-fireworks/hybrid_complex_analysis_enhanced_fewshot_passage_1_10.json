While he was speaking at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o heard these words about himself.\"\n</translation>\n\n### Commentary\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 10:**\n\n• **Structural Function:** This passage advances the story by eliminating Pua-liʻi (the stepfather) and recentering Nāmakaokapāoʻo with his mother. By having the protagonist **overhear** a discussion about his own strength and fate (a classic narrative trope in Hawaiian moʻolelo), it creates dramatic irony and foreshadows the central conflict to come.  \n\n• **Character Motivations:**  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāoʻo's food refusal:** Symbolizes profound grief or social rebellion. In traditional Hawaiian culture, refusing ʻai (food) represented extreme emotional distress or protest against social/psychological oppression (relating to his mother’s past trauma and his fraught relationship with Pua-liʻi).  \n  – **ʻAmaʻu's challenge:** Highlights competitive masculinity in chiefly culture. His declaration—\"If *I* die by *his* hand, he’s strong; if *he* cannot kill *me*, he’s weak\"—epitomizes the Hawaiian duel-to-death concept (*hoʻopaʻapaʻa*). Death wasn’t just physical defeat but proof/destruction of one’s *mana* (spiritual power).  \n\n• **Symbolic Geography & Measurements:**  \n  – **\"Five miles out to sea\"** for Pua-liʻi’s head:  \n    – Recalls an **ʻAi Kapu** -era funeral practice where enemies’ heads were discarded at sea to prevent ancestral connection. Five miles (*ʻelima mile*) mirrors symbolic recurrence of 5 in Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., 5 primal gods, 5-times chanted prayers).  \n    – References **Pua-liʻi’s name** (\"Child-of-Royalty\"): His unceremonious death contrasts his aristocratic title, showing vulnerability despite rank.  \n  – **Waikīkī** (spouting water) vs. **Honouliuli** (dark bay): Juxtaposes power centers. Waikīkī was the royal seat (implying 'Ama'u's authority), while Honouliuli in 'Ewa was agricultural—elevating a rural boy’s deeds to chiefly attention.  \n\n• **Narrative Allegory:**  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāoʻo \"hearing but not consuming\"** speech about himself: Metaphorizes his duality as both *victim* (of gossip) and *protector* (his name meaning “Eyes-of-the-pāoʻo-fish”). The pāoʻo fish buries itself in sand to observe predators unseen—symbolizing his concealed strength.  \n  – **ʻAmaʻu** (\"Fern\"): Represents entrenched chiefs bound by rigid codes. His challenge signals a clash between old-guard kapu rigidity (ʻAmaʻu) and transformative defiance (Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s deconstruction of ʻAi Kapu tropes in earlier paragraphs).  \n\n• **Cultural Nuances in Speech:**  \n  – Overheard dialogues in *Waikīkī*’s public spaces were historically accurate; chiefs held open court (*hale noho ali‘i*) where messengers delivered news.  \n  – The messenger reports the boy’s strength alongside the stepfather's death, subtly implying a prophecy: the child’s power rises as paternal authority falls.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
