This foreshadows his paradoxical traits of small size (\"ʻuʻuku loa\") and strength (\"ikaika loa\").\n   - **Kauluakahaʻi** follows the pattern of chiefly names containing natural elements (*kaulu* = growth, *akahaʻi* = to guide), signifying leadership.\n   - **Pōkaʻī** (Pō + kaʻī) suggests divine night (*pō*) and prosperity (*kaʻī*), common in female chiefly names.\n\n2. **Grammatical Structure**:\n   - The subject-initial focus marker **\"ʻo\"** (as in *ʻo Kauluakahaʻi*) emphasizes lineage, a critical detail in Hawaiian narratives.\n   - **\"He\"** as an indefinite marker introduces essential traits (*he keiki ikaika loa* = an extremely strong child).\n   - The phrase **\"‘a‘ohe ona lua\"** (he has no equal) uses the negator *ʻaʻohe* + *lua* (second/peer), a poetic device to elevate status.\n\n3. **Spatial Scope**:\n   - **\"Mai Hawaiʻi ā Niʻihau\"** denotes the entire Hawaiian archipelago, positioning Nāmakaokapāoʻo's uniqueness across all chiefdoms.\n\n#### **Cultural Significance**\n1. **Physical Paradox as Supernatural Sign**:\n   - The juxtaposition of diminutive size and immense strength signals connection to **mana** (spiritual power).

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;"
