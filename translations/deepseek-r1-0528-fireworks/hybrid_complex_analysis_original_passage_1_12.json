And they arrived at the plain of Keahumoa; they entered inside the house, [but] no person [was there]. As they prepared to return, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out above the ridgepole. When they heard the voice, there was no sight of the body; they asked: \"Where are you who is speaking?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Here I am up here.\" Eight men ascended: four at the back of the house, four at the front of the house, and they found Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"What is your purpose here?\" They replied: \"We have come to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o, a small youngster like you, [reportedly] very strong and fierce in battle, who personally killed his own father, Puali'i.\"",
  "deepseek-r1-0528-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\nHere is the analysis of the Hawaiian passage:\n\n<translation>\n'Ama'u the chief sent [warriors] from Waikīkī: four companies of warriors; each single company contained forty-eight men, and so for all four companies. And they arrived at the plain of Keahumoa; they entered inside the house, [but] no person [was there]. As they prepared to return, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out above the ridgepole. When they heard the voice, there was no sight of the body; they asked: \"Where are you who is speaking?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Here I am up here.\" Eight men ascended: four at the back of the house, four at the front of the house, and they found Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"What is your purpose here?\" They replied: \"We have come to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o, a small youngster like you, [reportedly] very strong and fierce in battle, who personally killed his own father, Puali'i.\"\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\nThis passage belongs to a larger narrative found in traditional Hawaiian moʻolelo (histories/accounts), specifically detailing accounts of inter-district warfare or chiefly conflicts. It depicts the dramatic confrontation between warriors sent by chief 'Ama'u and the formidable youth Nāmakaokapāo'o. The scene emphasizes Nāmakaokapāo'o's cunning (hiding above), physical prowess (small stature noted but strength questioned), and the shocking revelation of patricide central to his identity. The specific geographic references (Waikīkī, Keahumoa) and social structures (war companies, chiefdom orders) firmly anchor it within Hawaiʻi's historical traditions.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
