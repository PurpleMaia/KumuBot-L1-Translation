  "deepseek-r1-0528-fireworks_translation": "When Pualiʻi died, Nāmakaokapāoʻo returned to his mother, Pōkaʻī, and they lived together, but Nāmakaokapāoʻo had no food to eat. At that time, ʻAmaʻu, a chief of Oʻahu, resided in Waikīkī. A man from Honouliuli arrived in Waikīkī where the chief was staying and declared: \"O chief! There is an exceptionally strong young boy whose father has died—his head was thrown far out to sea, a very great distance, five miles away.\" When ʻAmaʻu heard this, he thought, \"If I defeat him and he dies by my hand, his strength is real—but if I do not kill him, his strength is nothing.\" As this was spoken in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāoʻo overheard these words about himself.",
  "deepseek-r1-0528-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n### English Translation\n<translation>\nWhen Pualiʻi died, Nāmakaokapāoʻo returned to his mother, Pōkaʻī, and they lived together, but Nāmakaokapāoʻo had no food to eat. At that time, ʻAmaʻu, a chief of Oʻahu, resided in Waikīkī. A man from Honouliuli arrived in Waikīkī where the chief was staying and declared: \"O chief! There is an exceptionally strong young boy whose father has died—his head was thrown far out to sea, a very great distance, five miles away.\" When ʻAmaʻu heard this, he thought, \"If I defeat him and he dies by my hand, his strength is real—but if I do not kill him, his strength is nothing.\" As this was spoken in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāoʻo overheard these words about himself.\n</translation>\n\n### Narrative Context\n<commentary>\nThis passage belongs to a larger Hawaiian heroic narrative (moʻolelo) centering on Nāmakaokapāoʻo—a youth renowned for supernatural strength (ikaika) following his father Pualiʻi's death. The excerpt introduces three key elements: 1) Nāmakaokapāoʻo's vulnerability (starvation), contrasting his physical power; 2) The chief ʻAmaʻu's challenge, embodying Hawaiian concepts of prowess and mana (spiritual power); 3) Foreshadowing of conflict via the protagonist overhearing threats. The \"five-mile\" detail emphasizes his mythic lineage, common in oral traditions where feats legitimize heroes. Structurally, it bridges mourning and rising action, setting the stage for a clash between status (aliʻi) and emergent strength.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
