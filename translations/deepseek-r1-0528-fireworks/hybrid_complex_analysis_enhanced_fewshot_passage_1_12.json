Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n<translation>\n'Ama'u the chief sent from Waikīkī, four war parties. In each single party were forty-eight men, and so it was with all four parties. They arrived at the plain of Keahumoa and entered the house, but found no one. As they prepared to leave, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from above the ridgepole. Hearing his voice but seeing no body, they asked: \"Where are you who speaks?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied: \"I am right up here.\" Eight men climbed up – four at the house's back and four at its front – until they located Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then Nāmakaokapāo'o inquired: \"What brings you here?\" They answered: \"We have come to battle Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, tremendously strong and brave, who killed his own father, Pua-li'i.\"\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 12:**\n• This episode showcases **classic conflict escalation** in mo'olelo traditions, beginning with the mobilization of war parties by a high-ranking chief. The passage simultaneously demonstrates **strategic war protocols** and **cosmic-scale numerology**:\n  – **'Ama'u** (possibly \"fractional\" or a fern variety) signifies his ruling status through title *ke ali'i*. His dispatch from **Waikīkī** (spouting water) aligns this setting with historic chiefly centers.\n  – **War party composition**: Four groups (*po'e kaua*), each numbering **48 warriors** (total 192), encodes cosmological significance:\n      – *4*: Symbolizes the **Hawaiian cardinal directions** and **major gods** (Kū, Kāne, Lono, Kanaloa).\n      – *48*: Relates to **Makahiki year cycles** (12 months × 4 kapu phases) – implying this mission coincides with festival season (traditionally a truce period) makes the mobilization sacrilegious.\n\n• **Locational symbolism** is critical: **Ke-ahu-moa** (chicken altar/mound) was previously established as Pua-li'i's homestead. That warriors enter an **empty house** invokes classic trope of protagonist elusiveness. Nāmakaokapāo'o's position \"atop the ridgepole\" (*luna o kaupoku*) carries deep theological weight:\n  – The *kaupoku* represented the **cosmic spine** of a Hawaiian home – analogous to the god Kāne upholding the sky. Perching here visually cements Nāmakaokapāo'o as a **boundary transgressor** suspended between realms.\n  – His **voice preceding visibility** (*lohe...'a'ohe na'e he 'ike 'ia o ke kino*) embodies the **kino lä** (invisible form) state of akua.\n\n• The warriors' **coordinated pursuit** (*'ewalu kānaka: 4 front, 4 back*) exemplifies **traditional siege tactics** (‘ili ‘opu). Yet the number *8* reflects:\n  – Practical strategy (full coverage of a rectangular hale). \n  – Esoterically: **Kū's war manifestations** (4×2) or **genealogical completeness** (Malo notes 8 generations define ancestry legitimacy).\n\n• The reported mission to battle a \"very strong small child\" (*keiki 'u'uku ... ikaika a me ke koa loa*) illustrates **Hawaiian heroic archetype inversions**. Nāmakaokapāo'o's perceived crime – **matricide** (*pepehi i kona makua kāne*) – draws dramatic tension from deep cultural taboos:\n  – Patricide violated **‘aikapu pono** (divine social order), viewed as kinolau-wreaking chaos.\n  – The warriors equate him to **revolutionary figures like Kamehameha I**, whose youth defied older systems. Their search ultimately fulfills prophecies about \"the small one who causes the land to be overturned\" (oral tradition parallels).\n\n• **Nāmakaokapāo'o's inquiry** (*He aha mai nei...?*) uses the deceptively casual phrase *'one'i* (which could denote intimacy or negligence), spotlighting his audacity. This mirrors **demigod testing rituals** where protagonists assess enemies' motives to calibrate their divine response.\n\n– **Note of Irony**: The warriors describe Nāmakaokapāo'o through **extended echo-phrasing** (\"like you... small... strong\") but fail to recognize him mid-conversation – a humor device heightening his supernatural concealment. This reflects **oral tradition misdirection patterns** used in Pele-Hi'iaka epics.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
