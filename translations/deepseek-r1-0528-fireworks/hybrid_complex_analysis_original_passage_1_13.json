This is what we have heard. Therefore, you will die by our hands; you shall not live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied: \"Then let us return down below to do battle.\" When they arrived below, Nāmakaokapāo'o attacked, and all were slain except for one man. That man fled and came upon 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He reported how all of them had perished, and he alone survived to carry this news so that 'Ama'u might hear it.",
  "deepseek-r1-0528-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

It depicts a confrontation between the warrior Nāmakaokapāo'o and challengers who unmask his true identity, leading to combat. Names and places like Ko'olau (a windward region of Oʻahu) and Waikīkī ground this in specific locations key to Oʻahu chiefly politics. The survivor's report underscores Hawaiian oral traditions, where messengers (ʻāhaʻilono) preserved battle accounts for genealogical records and historical transmission.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
