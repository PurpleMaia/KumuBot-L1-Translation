  "gpt-4_1_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together, but Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu here, was living at Waikīkī. A man came from Honouliuli all the way to Waikīkī, where the chief resided. That man said, “O chief! There is an exceptional little boy of great strength. His father has died and his head was cast far out to sea, at a great distance—five miles away.” When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he thought, “If his strength is greater than mine, I will die at his hands; but if not, then he has no strength.” As he was saying this at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words being spoken about him.",
  "gpt-4_1_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nWhen Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together, but Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu here, was living at Waikīkī. A man came from Honouliuli all the way to Waikīkī, where the chief resided. That man said, “O chief!

Nāmakaokapāo‘o returns to his biological mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two reside together.  \n  – The sentence, “ʻAʻole ʻai ʻo Nāmakaokapāoʻo i ka ʻai,” (Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat food) suggests grief or a period of ritual mourning, an act which can signify emotional distress, ritual kapu, or preparation for a pivotal transformation or challenge within Hawaiian custom. Fasting or refusal of food often precedes spiritual or physical trials in mo‘olelo.\n\n• **Expansion of Setting and Characters**  \n  – A new character appears: ‘Ama‘u, identified as an ali‘i (chief) of O‘ahu, residing at Waikīkī.  \n  – The arrival of a messenger (kanaka) from Honouliuli (a district in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu) to Waikīkī reflects the inter-district communication practices among ali‘i and the ritual of public announcements or challenges.  \n  – The oral report delivered is formulaic in style, with the messenger addressing ‘Ama‘u directly and employing hyperbolic language to introduce the wonder-child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Such oral announcements are a staple of chiefly courts, used to relay feats, provocations, or notable occurrences, sometimes as preludes to contest, alliance, or conflict.\n\n• **Symbolic Action: The Head Cast into the Sea**  \n  – The narrativized detail that Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s father's “head was cast far out to sea, at a great distance—five miles away” is both literal and metaphorical.  \n  – In Hawaiian poetic and narrative tradition, the casting of a head (po‘o) into the sea evokes several possible readings:\n    - **Ancestral offering or sacrifice:** The sea is a conduit to the gods and ancestral realms, making the act an offering or a means of purification.\n    - **Exile or removal of mana:** By removing the head (primary seat of mana or spiritual power) far from the land, it symbolically distances the power or threat posed by Pua-li‘i, allowing Nāmakaokapāo‘o to emerge as a successor, unimpeded.\n    - **Hyperbolic expression:** The “five miles” emphasizes the superhuman force involved, likely referring to Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prodigious strength and the extraordinary scale of events.\n\n• **Announcement and Challenge: The Chiefly Response**  \n  – The response of ‘Ama‘u is both competitive and calculating. He measures the strength of the boy against his own, manifesting the chiefly trait of kua‘ana (rivalrous comparison), a key theme in many mo‘olelo ali‘i:\n    - “If his strength is greater than mine, I will die at his hands; if not, he has no strength.” This is a formulaic utterance, conveying both readiness for contest and the closed, zero-sum logic of chiefly prowess (i.e., only the strongest survives or rules).\n    – Chiefs were often tested, publicly or through messenger, to establish or reaffirm their mana, authority, and fitness to rule; challenges and reports of marvels would quickly spread via ‘aha‘āina (chiefly gatherings) or through messengers.\n\n• **Nāmakaokapāo‘o Overhears – Motif of the Eavesdropping Hero**  \n  – The closing observation, that Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard these words being spoken about him, is significant on multiple levels:\n    - As in many heroic narratives, the protagonist is aware of challenges or perceptions that will soon shape his destiny, allowing narrative progression and internal development.\n    - It also marks the transition to a phase where Nāmakaokapāo‘o will be tested by established chiefs, i.e., entry into the chiefly hero cycle.\n\n• **Etymology and Symbolism in Names**  \n  – ‘Ama‘u: In botanical terms, ʻamaʻu is a native Hawaiian fern, but here, as a name, it may suggest endurance, rootedness, or ancient lineage connected to the land (especially relevant for an ali‘i of O‘ahu).\n  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o: As previously discussed, “Nā maka o ka pāo‘o”—the eyes of the pāo‘o fish—suggests watchfulness, mystique, and a liminal, transformative capability (pāo‘o being a cave-dwelling or shapeshifting fish in some traditions). The symbolism of “maka” (eye or bud) and “pāo‘o” (dark, hidden, protected) also resonates with the narrative themes of concealed power, emergent potential, or the germination of new ali‘i mana.\n\n• **Cultural Practices and Narrative Functions**  \n  – The motif of the orphaned or exceptional child, bereft of one or both parents and subsequently involved in contests with established local leaders, is widespread in Hawaiian and Polynesian storytelling. It shapes the narrative trajectory toward the inevitable contest of mana, and frequently serves to critique or reset social order (especially when the youthful protagonist supplants, reeducates, or complements the authority of older ali‘i).\n\nIn summary, this paragraph deftly weaves together themes of mourning, chiefly rivalry, the miraculous deeds of the hero-child, and the mechanisms of oral announcement and challenge. It sets the stage for the testing of Nāmakaokapāo‘o and dramatizes the emergence of new mana in the wake of generational transition.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
