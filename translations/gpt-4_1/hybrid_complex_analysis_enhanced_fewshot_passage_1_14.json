  "gpt-4_1_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard, he prepared his eighteen war canoes and set sail down to 'Ewa to do battle with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u and his men reached 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o persisted in slaughtering them until there were none left; not a single person survived, and 'Ama'u perished. Thus, all of O'ahu became subject to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then, he fetched his mother and established her over the land of O'ahu.",
  "gpt-4_1_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nWhen 'Ama'u heard, he prepared his eighteen war canoes and set sail down to 'Ewa to do battle with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u and his men reached 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o persisted in slaughtering them until there were none left; not a single person survived, and 'Ama'u perished. Thus, all of O'ahu became subject to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then, he fetched his mother and established her over the land of O'ahu.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 14:**\n• This passage brings the narrative to a critical moment of conquest and political turning point, following a traditional structure in Hawaiian mo'olelo (stories) in which personal vengeance or the assertion of aliʻi (chiefly) power results in a change of rulership, often signifying the shifting fortunes of lineages and the sanctity of maternal ancestry.\n  \n• **Characters and Place Names:**\n  – **'Ama'u:** Likely a chief of O'ahu, the name 'Ama'u may derive from the word for a native fern (*Sadleria sp.*), symbolizing resilience or abundance. Chiefs' names often bear associations with landscape features, plants, or animals, reflecting mana (spiritual power) and their relationship to the land.\n  – **Nāmakaokapāo'o (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o):** Literally \"the eyes of the pāo'o (goby fish)\"—as highlighted in the earlier examples, the name is figurative and may imply watchfulness, adaptability, and persistence, qualities associated with the pāo'o fish, which traverses both fresh and saltwater zones and can endure difficult conditions.\n\n• **Political and Social Structure:**\n  – The mustering of \"he 'umi kumamāwalu\" (eighteen war canoes) alludes to the organized military actions of aliʻi during the pre-contact and 'Ai Kapu periods. The number is symbolically significant in Hawaiian storytelling—numbers such as eighteen mark the scale of the conflict and would be understood as an imposing force, underscoring the magnitude of the coming battle.\n  – The reference to landing at 'Ewa (an important district on Oʻahu) to confront Nāmakaokapāo'o situates this event in a politically and agriculturally rich region, historically a center of aliʻi power and competition for land and resources.\n\n• **The Battle and Its Aftermath:**\n  – The description \"noke mai ana 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o i ka luku ā pau loa\" (\"Nāmakaokapāo'o persisted in annihilating them completely\") reflects the extremity of the conflict. Complete destruction is emphasized—\"'a'ohe kanaka koe\" (\"not a single person remained\")—evoking the concept of \"luku\" (to massacre, utterly destroy), a motif in stories of conquest and extermination in Hawaiian oral tradition.\n  – The death of 'Ama'u marks the collapse of the opposing chiefly line and signals a dramatic shift in the island's political landscape—\"Puni a'ela 'o O'ahu nei iā Nāmakaokapāo'o\" (\"all of O'ahu was encompassed/generated/overcome by Nāmakaokapāo'o\"). The verb \"puni\" can mean to be covered over, surrounded, or destroyed, but in chiefly context, it also connotes the total subjugation of a territory.\n\n• **Maternal Lineage and the Principle of 'Reciprocal Atonement':**\n  – After his victory, Nāmakaokapāo'o brings his mother (\"ki'i akula ia i kona makuahine\") and installs her as sovereign (\"ho'onoho ihola i luna o ka 'āina O'ahu nei\"). This action highlights a foundational Hawaiian value: the primacy of maternal lineage (moʻokūʻauhau), and the aliʻi practice of securing status and political power through the mother’s rank.  \n  – It was well understood that the mother’s mana, especially if she was herself of high descent, legitimized a chief's claim. The physical act of bringing the mother and establishing her as ruler binds the victory to genealogy, ensuring the perpetuation of his line’s authority over Oʻahu and aligning with the broader Polynesian pattern of matrilineal validation of chiefly rights.\n\n• **Allegorical and Symbolic Interpretation:**\n  – The absolute wiping out of 'Ama'u and his men may function as an allegory for the ending of an era or the establishment of a new order, echoing patterns of cyclical renewal.  \n  – The installation of the mother as ruler is deeply symbolic: it represents a return, or homage, to the source of life and authority, central to the maintenance of pono (cosmic balance) in both the land and chiefly rule.\n  – In the context of the 'Ai Kapu epoch, where social order depended on the maintenance of sacred eating taboos and careful genealogical reckoning, this moment signifies both a climax of martial prowess and a restoration—or even elevation—of sacred order through the female line.\n\n• **Conclusion:**\n  – This passage encapsulates an archetypal moment of Hawaiian mo'olelo: through decisive action and adherence to cultural protocols, the protagonist not only conquers but legitimizes and stabilizes his rule by honoring maternal ancestry—a framework vital to the structure and transmission of Hawaiian chiefly authority and tradition.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
