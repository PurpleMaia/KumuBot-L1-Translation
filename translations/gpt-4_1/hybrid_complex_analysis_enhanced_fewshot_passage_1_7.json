  "gpt-4_1_translation": "Puali‘i seized the ko‘ilipi (a type of club or weapon) and went over until he found Nāmakaokapāo‘o roasting his four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the children saw what was happening, and they ran and stood far off because they were afraid of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! Here is the ko‘ilipi in my hand, something to sever your head with today—when your head is cut off, then it will be cooked and eaten with the sweet potato, and I will eat first, and then it will be noa (free/unrestricted).” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no attention to these words of Puali‘i, so Puali‘i spoke again, a second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the ko‘ilipi, but then Nāmakaokapāo‘o began to recite his death prayer against Puali‘i. The prayer went as follows:\n\nCherished indeed are the eyes of my little pāo‘o,\nNow scorched, now blackened,\nPerhaps to be eaten, or perhaps left aside,\nPerhaps left as Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,\nThat one is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,\nThis is my companion,\nNāmakaokai‘a is the high chief of Hawai‘i,\nLet the greedy hands slip away,\nThose are men with spears,\nThe spears with the drums,\nDeath comes to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "gpt-4_1_commentary": "**Paragraph 7 Analysis:**\n\n• **Escalation of Conflict and Ritualized Violence:**\n  – Puali‘i, whose name suggests \"descendant of chiefs, of chiefly line,\" now takes a **ko‘ilipi**, a weapon-defining this as a moment of potential ritual violence. The ko‘ilipi itself is a culturally loaded term: it refers to a serrated adze or club historically used in sacrifices or executions, and as a tool for decapitation, symbolizes life and death authority, typically wielded by those in power or during decisive ritual acts.\n  – The narrative here intensifies the tension introduced in earlier passages: after Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s previous destruction of the sweet potato patches and the symbolic threat against his body (his \"head and eyes\" as food), Puali‘i now prepares to actually carry out this punishment within the presence of witnesses (the other children), who flee in fear. This reflects both the seriousness of the social order threatened and the dangers inherent in the traditional household, especially under the ancient **‘Ai Kapu** system.\n\n• **Public Spectacle and Social Order:**\n  – The children’s fear and retreat to a distance underscore the public nature of punishment and its didactic intent. Such spectacles were part of ancient *kānāwai* (law/codes) enforcement, meant to serve as lessons to the entire community regarding the consequences of taboo-breaking or destruction of valuable resources (here, the *‘uala*).\n\n• **The Pronouncement of Kapu (Taboo) and Noa (Release):**\n  – Puali‘i’s lines: \"when your head is cut off, then it will be cooked and eaten with the sweet potato, and I will eat first, and then it will be noa,\" encapsulate a core logic within Hawaiian ritual practice:\n      • The act of consuming the sacrificed (human or substituted offering) is a transition between *kapu* (sacred restriction, danger, power, ritual possession) and *noa* (release, everyday, ordinary). Only after the correct sequence of violence and ritual consumption can normalcy return.\n      • The focus on \"I will eat first\" is significant: in ritual meals, rank determines eating order—chiefs, priests, or sacrificers consume first, cementing the social hierarchy. Eating \"first\" is an assertion of Puali‘i's authority in the household or over the victim.\n\n• **Refusal and Invocation of Spiritual Power:**\n  – Despite this threat, Nāmakaokapāo‘o does not respond or obey. Instead, he composes and utters a *pule make* (death prayer, imprecatory chant), a type of composition believed to call upon spiritual forces to turn or mitigate the fate imposed by others. Such prayers are used throughout Hawaiian oral tradition, often to call down curses or protection.\n      – By reciting a death prayer **against** Puali‘i, Nāmakaokapāo‘o invokes the cosmological and genealogical dimensions of protection; to speak one's prayer is to summon ancestral mana to intercede.\n\n• **Breakdown and Analysis of the Pule:**\n  – \"Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o\" / \"Cherished indeed are the eyes of my little pāo‘o\": Refers both to the physical eyes of Nāmakaokapāo‘o and to the *maka* (sprout, eye, origin) of the sweet potato (the crop he was tending/cooking). The word *pāo‘o* is ambiguous but often refers to a species of goby fish or, poetically, to the \"head\" (as in \"nā maka o ka pāo‘o\"—the eyes of the pāo‘o fish/head), linking the sacrificial motif of body and food.\n      – \"E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei\" / \"Now scorched, now blackened\": Describes sweet potatoes being roasted, but also refers to his own possible fate (\"to be burnt, charred\"), linking body and food in the sacrificial economy.\n      – \"E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha\" / \"Perhaps to be eaten, or perhaps left aside\": Balances the uncertainty of fate; in sacrifice, not everything is consumed—some is saved for the gods (left on the *lele*, altar), some returned to the people.\n      – \"E waiho paha Nākukui‘aimakaokalani\" (\"perhaps left as Nākukui‘aimakaokalani\"), \"‘O Kukui‘aimakaokalani kēlā\" (\"That one is Kukui‘aimakaokalani\"): \n          • *Nākukui‘aimakaokalani* and *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* appear to be personal or ancestral names/titles, possibly of protective or guardian spirits. *Kukui*, the candlenut, is symbolic of light, enlightenment, genealogy, or even eyes (the glistening of kukui as eyes). *Aima ka o ka lani* (\"tears/eyes of the heavens\") references celestial or ancestor-given sight/protection. The naming here wraps Nāmakaokapāo‘o in a web of spiritual relationships.\n          • Alternatively, they could be literal relatives or allies to whom the prayer is directed for assistance.\n      – \"‘O ku‘u wahi aikāne kēia\" / \"This is my companion\": *Aikāne* were intimate companions, often with strong spiritual, political, or sexual connotations. Invoking an *aikāne* ties the speaker to a peer network of loyalty—a potential spiritual or otherworldly helper.\n      – \"‘O Nāmakaokai‘a ke ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i\" / \"Nāmakaokai‘a is the high chief of Hawai‘i\": This may be self-referential (claiming the title of high chief), or perhaps referring to another powerful ancestor/spiritual protector. The name Nāmakaokai‘a (\"the eyes of the fish\") speaks to the surveillance, watchfulness, and protection of the ali‘i nui (supreme chief).\n      – \"E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale\" / \"Let the greedy hands slip away\": *He‘e* (to slip, to escape, to slide) here is both an imperative and wish: \"let escape happen,\" let the hands (of violence) slip away empty, or let the killer be unable to grasp his victim.\n      – \"‘O kānaka nō me ka ihe, ‘O ka ihe nō me ka pahu\": \"Those are men with spears, The spears with the drums\": A poetic description of warriors and the presence of ritual objects (spears, drums)—possibly acknowledging the inevitability of violence or situating it within the context of battle and sacrifice, but also repeating known tropes from chanted genealogies and histories.\n      – \"Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" / \"Death comes to Nāmakaokapāo‘o\": A closing line that can be read either as resignation to fate or as a hex upon the one who would cause his death—which in some context would reflect back upon the would-be killer.\n\n• **Allegorical and Esoteric Layering:**\n  – This passage is deeply allegorical, enacting the tension between old and new systems of authority—especially *kānāwai* and *‘Ai Kapu* (the sacred eating order and restrictions). Puali‘i's insistence on ritual consumption links him to the older, more rigid kapu order—he embodies the punitive and hierarchical past. Nāmakaokapāo‘o, by contrast, wields spiritual resistance and genealogy—his pule asserts an alternative source of power, rooted in prayer, kinship, and spiritual invocation rather than brute force.\n  – The use of the pule at the moment of crisis is characteristic of many tales involving ali‘i or demigods in Hawaiian mythology: a supernatural intervention flips the balance of power, often saving the hero or cursing the aggressor.\n  – There is also a strong symbolic identification between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and the sweet potato (*‘uala*) as staple food, person and crop being potentially sacrificed, eaten, or spared. The repeated references to *eyes* (*maka*) and *head* (*po‘o*) both literalize and spiritualize the threat, echoing naming patterns (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o) and suggesting the hero stands as symbolic representative of the people (the maka‘āinana, \"eyes of the land,\" the commoners).\n\n• **Conclusion:**\n  – This episode crystallizes several themes in Hawaiian narrative tradition: the use of public ritual violence to maintain order; the countervailing power of prayer, kinship, and genealogy; the transformations enacted at moments of crisis; and the ways in which bodily sacrifice, food, and cosmology are interwoven. The shift from violence to prayer heralds potential transformation—either in the logic of tradition, the fate of the participants, or both.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
