  "gpt-4_1_translation": "They lived there and cultivated food; he (Puali‘i) had two long sweet potato patches lying there up until this day, and the name of those patches, up to this day, is Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When the sweet potatoes matured, Puali‘i stated his solemn vow: “When the head of the ulua fish is baked together with the sweet potatoes and Puali‘i eats, then it will be free (noa)—then his wife, Pōka‘ī, and others may eat as well.” Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for something to eat with the sweet potatoes.",
  "gpt-4_1_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**\n• This passage situates the family of Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī in a phase of settled agricultural life, a classic motif in Hawaiian mo‘olelo that denotes both industriousness and rootedness in land (mālama ‘āina). The explicit mention of “mahi ‘ai” (to cultivate food) highlights subsistence living and the centrality of ‘uala (sweet potato) as a staple crop in traditional Hawaiian society.   \n&nbsp;– The narrative credits Puali‘i with owning and tending to two “māla ‘uala lō‘ihi” (“long sweet potato patches”), which he has maintained up to the present (“ā hiki i kēia lā”). Place names being preserved in perpetuity is a recurring feature of Hawaiian oral tradition; it both anchors legendary figures in the landscape and acts as a form of cultural cartography.  \n&nbsp;– The naming of patches as “Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (the name of their son/child) is significant. “Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o” can be broken down as “the eyes of the pāo‘o (goby) fish,” referencing either the child himself or the emblematic power of naming land and its produce after familial or legendary figures. This process immortalizes individuals and stories in the geography (see Pukui’s discussions of inoa ‘āina, place names as cultural memory).  \n\n• The maturation of the ‘uala (the sweet potatoes ripened: “o‘o ka ‘uala”) sets the stage for ritualized consumption, governed by the strictures of the ‘Ai Kapu system, a gendered food taboo system central to pre-contact Hawaiian life.  \n&nbsp;– Puali‘i’s pronouncement (“‘ōlelo ho‘ohiki,” a vow or oath) is explicit: not until the ulua’s (giant trevally) head is baked with the ‘uala, and he (Puali‘i) eats, will the food become “noa”—free of religious restriction—and thus be edible by his wife Pōka‘ī and other (presumably women and children, “nā mea ‘ē a‘e”).   \n&nbsp;– The ulua (Caranx ignobilis) holds ritual significance. Its head is specially mentioned because in ‘Ai Kapu meal structure, certain prized parts of certain animals or fish—such as the head—were traditionally reserved for males of chiefly or priestly status, reinforced through food prohibitions. Thus, the meal is not merely a matter of sustenance, but dense with social and religious meaning.\n\n• The phrase “noa” denotes the state of being ritually free from kapu (taboo). In the ‘Ai Kapu system, particular foods and certain eating times or circumstances were forbidden (kapu) until specific rites were performed—often culminating in a man eating first, then declaring the food “noa,” thereby releasing it for women and others. This underscores the gendered stratification and sacred ordering of everyday life:  \n&nbsp;– The declaration of “noa” through food consumption is a performative act, one that transforms the environment from sacred-restricted (kapu) to common-permitted (noa). This practice projects male authority and ritual power into the domestic sphere.\n\n• The practical outcome of this kapu: Puali‘i “iho akula i kai o Honouliuli e lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala” (descended to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for something to eat with the sweet potatoes).  \n&nbsp;– Honouliuli (lit. “dark bay” or “dark slip of land”) is a well-known ahupua‘a on O‘ahu, rich in coastal resources. The act of going “i kai” (down to the sea) for “i‘a ‘ai pū” (fish to eat together with ‘uala) reflects the essential pairing of kula (fields) and kai (sea) in Hawaiian subsistence: a balanced diet and a worldview that sees land and ocean as spiritually and practically interconnected.  \n&nbsp;– Puali‘i’s agency in seeking out fish himself further underlines the values of industriousness and self-sufficiency (as opposed to chiefly privilege, which might expect retainers to do the work), signaling either his social status or a narrative motif of humility.\n\n• Allegorically, this passage also encodes a broader commentary on custom and order:  \n&nbsp;– The ritualization of eating, the gender and taboo boundaries, and the repetitive performance of cultivating, harvesting, and communal sharing all emphasize the cyclical, regulated, and deeply sacralized mode of traditional Hawaiian existence.  \n&nbsp;– References to vows (“‘ōlelo ho‘ohiki”) and the naming of land after prominent individuals or events also serve as mnemonic devices, reminding descendants and listeners of the foundational actions and values of their ancestors. \n\n• In summary, this paragraph operates on multiple levels: as a literal episode depicting subsistence labor and domestic order, as an index of ‘Ai Kapu religious practice, as a function of toponymic memory, and as an allegory for the cycles of work, restriction, release, and the sanctification of daily acts in Hawaiian culture.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
