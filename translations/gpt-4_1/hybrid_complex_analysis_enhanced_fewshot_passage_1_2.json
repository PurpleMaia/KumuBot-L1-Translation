  "gpt-4_1_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa was the land where the two came together in union, and through their sleeping together, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was conceived. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, and Pōka‘ī remained, pregnant, and later gave birth. With this birth, Pōka‘ī and her child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, became very poor.",
  "gpt-4_1_commentary": "**Paragraph 2: Setting, Conception, and the Single-Mother Motif**\n\n• **Geographical and Social Context:**  \n  – The narrative specifies *Hō‘ae‘ae* in *‘Ewa* (a district on the island of O‘ahu) as the land where the union took place. In Hawaiian storytelling, it is customary to firmly anchor the action in a specific *wāhi* (place), emphasizing that land and genealogy are intertwined. *Hō‘ae‘ae* itself is a wetland region historically noted for its fertility and abundance, suggesting complex undertones of creation and continuity.\n\n• **The Union and Conception:**  \n  – The phrase \"launa kino ai me ka moe‘ana iho\" refers delicately but explicitly to sexual union (*launa kino*: physical intimacy; *moe‘ana*: sleeping together), an important narrative device marking the conception of an ali‘i (chiefly) child. This explicit but respectful reference aligns with traditional Hawaiian storytelling, where the circumstances of a child's conception—specifically site, season, and genealogy—profoundly determine the child's *mana* (spiritual power) and place in society.\n\n• **Genealogical Separation and Gender Dynamics:**  \n  – Upon learning of Pōka‘ī’s pregnancy, Kauluakaha‘i departs for \"kona ‘āina\" (“his land”), leaving Pōka‘ī to dwell alone with her pregnancy. This pattern—where an outside or chiefly lover (often of semi-divine status, as Kauluakaha‘i is described) disappears after the union—occurs frequently in mo‘olelo (traditional narratives). It is reflective both of migratory chiefly practices, where ali‘i might travel and leave behind offspring, and of allegorical connections to gods or ancestors who traverse realms.  \n  – In practical terms, Pōka‘ī is left as a single mother, a motif that recurs throughout Hawaiian literature and is especially poignant in times of political or inter-island tumult. Her parenting alone signals both vulnerability and a test of resilience.\n\n• **The 'Ilihune Theme: Poverty and Social Standing:**  \n  – The closing sentence, \"he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki,\" declares their great poverty after birth. *‘Ili-hune* (lit., “skin-poor”) suggests not just material poverty but a state of social isolation or ostracization, commonly associated with women who bear ali‘i children out of wedlock or whose chiefly partners depart.  \n  – This theme reflects the social structures of the ‘Ai Kapu era, where lineage and support networks determined individual status. Without Kauluakaha‘i’s continued presence and support, Pōka‘ī’s and Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s standing plummets.  \n  – Allegorically, the child (Nāmakaokapāo‘o) born in poverty but of chiefly and possibly divine descent foreshadows a “hidden” or “humble” origin later yielding greatness—a classic structure in Polynesian epic birth narratives (see: Pukui, Haole, \"Hawaiian Genealogies\"; Kame‘eleihiwa, \"Native Land and Foreign Desires\").\n\n• **Names and Their Meanings:**  \n  – *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (“The eyes of the pāo‘o fish”): Already, the name implies depth, perhaps a connection to insight or perseverance, alluding to his future role. The obscurity and humility of his beginnings contrast with latent potential.  \n  – *Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i* (“The inspiration of Kaha‘i” or “the growth caused by Kaha‘i”): His swift return to his homeland emphasizes the transient, almost mythic role of the procreative male in many Hawaiian cosmogonies.  \n  – *Pō-ka‘ī* (“Night falls upon…,” or possibly “the darkness of the chief”): The maternal line is left with the burden of nurturing and raising a child in hardship, a common device to highlight endurance and maternal fortitude.\n\n• **Cultural and Allegorical Layers:**  \n  – The motif of the “abandoned mother and extraordinary child” can be interpreted as a metaphor for the Hawaiian people’s relationship with their akua (gods/ancestors) and chiefly lines: periodic absences or losses test the strength of the land and its people, often resulting in hidden greatness.  \n  – The setting in Hō‘ae‘ae, a region of old richness and agricultural significance, now juxtaposed with the “poverty” of Pōka‘ī and her son, mirrors the loss of abundance following the breakdown of chiefly support—a harbinger of change in social and spiritual order.\n\nIn summary, this paragraph serves as a transition from genealogical preparation to the central themes of struggle, resilience, and hidden nobility—pervasive structures in Hawaiian oral tradition. It positions Pōka‘ī as a figure of hardship and perseverance, and establishes Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a child with humble beginnings, who is nevertheless destined for remarkable deeds due to his chiefly, even divine, parentage.",
