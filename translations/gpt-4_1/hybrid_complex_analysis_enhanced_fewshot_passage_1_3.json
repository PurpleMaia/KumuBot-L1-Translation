  "gpt-4_1_translation": "While the two were living together, Puali‘i—a good man from Līhuʻe—came down to go fishing along the shore at Honouliuli, and he paid a visit to the home of Pōka‘ī. Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and desired her, and he said, “I want you as my woman.” Pōka‘ī replied, “How could you want me? I have borne a child, and my body is ruined.” Puali‘i responded, “That does not matter—if you want me, let us sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed, and so she went with her man, with Puali‘i, to the plains of Keahumoa, to live.",
  "gpt-4_1_commentary": "• This passage marks a turning point in the narrative dynamics and domestic life of Pōka‘ī following the birth of her child with her previous partner, introducing significant social and interpersonal negotiations of status, gender, and bodily value. The detail and dialog reveal multiple layers of cultural practice during the traditional Hawaiian era.\n\n• **Character Introduction and Place Naming:**\n   – A new male figure enters the narrative: Pua-li‘i (Pua: child/descendant, li‘i: chiefly). His name suggests possible chiefly rank or descent, although his adscription as “he kanaka maika‘i” (“a good man”) foregrounds his personal character over his ancestry. Such introductory markers are a literary convention in Hawaiian mo‘olelo (stories), situating the character through actions, origins, and nature.\n   – Līhu‘e (precise identification debated on O‘ahu or Kaua‘i in this context) and the shoreline of Honouliuli (‘Ewa District, O‘ahu) are specified, invoking a sense of regional movement and reinforcing the mobility that was common in Hawaiian society, where land and sea travel were routine and intimately interconnected with sustenance activities like fishing.\n\n• **Hospitality and Custom:**\n   – Puali‘i’s visitation to the home of Pōka‘ī aligns with broader Hawaiian customs of aloha and hospitality. Within the ‘Ai Kapu era (a period governed by strict social and religious kapu, or sacred law), it was normative protocol to accept guests and offer food, water, and shelter, irrespective of prior acquaintance. Refusing such hospitality could incur social disapproval or even supernatural consequences.\n   – This open-door custom contextualizes the plausibility of Puali‘i’s bold approach and Pōka‘ī’s receptiveness to his presence.\n\n• **Dialogue and Gendered Discourse:**\n   – The dialogue is direct and intimate, revealing shifts in customary forms of courtship that might have occurred within chiefly or commoner contexts. Puali‘i’s plain-spoken desire (“Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u”) demonstrates the pragmatic as well as emotional nature of such proposals, where marriage or partnership may be negotiated swiftly and with few intermediaries.\n   – Pōka‘ī’s self-deprecation (“Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino”—“I have borne a child and my body is ruined”) reflects not only personal vulnerability but social realities about female worth being tied to bodily “intactness.” Concerns with post-partum body image are recorded elsewhere in Hawaiian oral tradition, though they may also indicate the lasting power of kapu-era beliefs regarding purity and eligibility for remarriage.\n       • Her comment may also gesture toward deeper anxieties of kapu violations; in some periods, women who had borne children and were not currently married might risk marginality within their communities.\n\n   – Puali‘i’s reply rejects this stigma (“He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua”—“It does not matter, if you want me, let us sleep together”), affirming the primacy of mutual desire over restrictive bodily ideals or social taboos, at least in this domestic situation. Such candor further highlights the range of possible responses to kapu conventions and evolving gender roles.\n\n• **Relocation and Founding of a New Household:**\n   – Their move to “ke kula o Keahumoa” (the plains of Keahumoa) represents the formalization of their relationship through new geographical and domestic settlement. “Keahu-moa” (Heap of chickens, though possibly “heap” in general—symbolically linked to abundance or newly founded productivity) underscores the theme of fertility and starting anew.\n       • In Hawaiian traditions, founding a new household and a change of residence (especially to the man’s home region) was a traditional act of union, akin to “marriage” by cohabitation and mutual acknowledgment.\n\n• **Allegorical and Socio-Historical Readings:**\n   – Allegorically, this passage may be read as a commentary on the possibility for renewal and second chances for women who, due to life events (childbirth, widowhood, or abandonment), were often judged by broader social standards.\n       • Puali‘i’s attitude exemplifies aloha and acceptance, an idealized masculine response standing in contrast to kapu-era judgments.\n   – The episode further articulates the porous boundaries between individual agency and social expectation, with Pōka‘ī’s hesitation overcome by reassurance, and a new familial unit established through mutual choice.\n\n• **Summary:**\n   – This passage encapsulates key features of Hawaiian mo‘olelo: movement across the landscape, introduction and refinement of relationships, and the negotiation of social status and bodily value. The household formed by Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i—founded in the heart of Keahumoa—stands as a testament to the resilience and dynamic adaptation of human relationships within the fabric of traditional Hawaiian society.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
