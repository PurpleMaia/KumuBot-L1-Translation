  "reference_translation": "When Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui woke up in the morning and went out of doors, they saw a wooden dagger sticking in the ground just outside of the entrance. At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”",
  "deepseek-r1-0528-dsapi_translation": "Here is the English translation of the Hawaiian text:\n\n<translation>As for Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, when they went out of the house in the morning, they saw a taboo stick standing at the door of the house, it had been set up. Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: \"We will die! Here is a taboo stick at the door of our house! It is found. Alas for us in death; this is what I told you, to leave the chief, there is no avoiding death by words.\"</translation>\n\n**Key Translation Notes:**\n1.  **Pahoa:** Translated as \"taboo stick\" (a stick or post signifying a kapu/taboo, violation of which was punishable by death). While \"pahoa\" can also mean dagger, the context (being set up at the doorway causing immediate fear of death) strongly indicates the taboo stick meaning.\n2.  **Make kaua!:** Literally \"Die we!\". Translated idiomatically as \"We will die!\" expressing fatalistic realization.\n3.  **Ua loaa:** Literally \"is found\". Translated as \"It is found\" meaning the sign (the taboo stick) confirming their fate has been discovered/encountered.\n4.  **Aloha ino kaua i ka make:** Expresses deep sorrow/pity for themselves facing death (\"Alas for us in death\").\n5.  **O ka'u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe e waiho ke 'lii, aohe make olelo:** This complex phrase conveys: \"This is what I told you before, to leave the chief, [but] there is no escaping death by words [talking about it won't save us].\" \"Waiho ke 'lii\" implies leaving or avoiding a chiefly figure (likely the source of the kapu). \"Aohe make olelo\" means \"no death [is] without speech\" or more freely, \"words/talking won't prevent this death.\""
