  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession.",
  "deepseek-r1-0528-dsapi_translation": "Here is the English translation of the Hawaiian text:\n\n<translation>Waiakea in Hilo is the land, Halepaki is the father, Wailea is the mother. Wailea had a younger sister, Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala. Kaipalaoa was born and grew up. His father [Halepaki] went to Kauai, where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a sacred chief of Kauai, a chief skilled in riddling contests (ho'opapa), the one who broke the bones of men. Halepaiwi [is the place], a very small area surrounded entirely by this place where human bones were broken. Halepaki indeed knew riddling and had been taught, but he was not an expert. He sailed to Kauai and was killed there by Kalanialiiloa. Pueonuiokona was the chief of Kauai.</translation>\n\n**Key Translation Notes:**\n1.  **O Waiakea i Hilo ka ʻāina:** Establishes the ancestral land connection.\n2.  **He kaikaina hoi ko Wailea:** Identifies Kalenaihaleauau as Wailea's younger sister.\n3.  **Ke ʻlii o Kohala:** \"The chief of Kohala\" modifies Kukuipahu.\n4.  **Hanau o Kaipalaoa a nui:** \"Kaipalaoa was born and grew up\" (assumed to be Halepaki & Wailea's son).\n5.  **He ʻlii akamai i ka hoopapa, nana ua pa iwi nei o kanaka:** Describes Kalanialiiloa's skill in riddling and his deadly practice (\"the one who broke the bones of men\").\n6.  **O Halepaiwi, he wahi iki koe puni loa ua pa nei i ka iwi kanaka:** Explains the place name Halepaiwi (\"Broken Bones of Halepaki\") as a small, infamous spot defined by bone-breaking.\n7.  **Ua ike no o Halepaki i ka hoopapa, ua ao ia no, aole nae i ailolo:** Contrasts Halepaki's knowledge of riddling with his lack of true expertise (\"knew... taught... not an expert\").\n8.  **Holo e i Kauai a make ai ia Kalanialiiloa:** States Halepaki sailed to Kauai and was killed by Kalanialiiloa.\n9.  **O Pueonuiokona ke ʻlii o Kauai:** Names the ruling chief of Kauai at the time."
