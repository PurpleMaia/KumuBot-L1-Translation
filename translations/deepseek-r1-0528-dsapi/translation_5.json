This is not that destitute girl.\" The two listened again to the words of the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki. \"Let us go up and speak to the chief, lest this girl be taken care of (by someone else).\" The other agreed. \"Yes.\" They arrived before Makiioeoe the chief, at midnight, and awoke him: \"O you there, awake!\" \"What?\" said Makiioeoe. \"An owl, there right above the tower where the girl is confined. Thus spoke the owl, and we heard it calling down to the girl.\"</translation>\n\n**Key Translation Notes:**\n*   **Elua hana ana peia:** \"The two were doing thus\" (referring to the guards performing their watch).\n*   **lohe na kiai, ala ae la hoolohe:** \"the guards heard, awoke and listened\".\n*   **ka olelo a ka pueo:** \"the words of the owl\" (pueo is a Hawaiian owl, often considered an ʻaumakua or familial guardian spirit).\n*   **o Laukiamanuikahiki:** A chiefly name.\n*   **he waa ula...:** The list describes the *typical, magnificent arrival* of Laukiamanuikahiki (red canoe, sail, paddle, attendant; large/small/long canoes; large/small attendants) contrasting with the humble state (\"destitute girl\") they see before them.\n*   **E pii kaua e olelo i ke 'lii, malama o ke kaikamahine no keia:** \"Let us go up and speak to the chief, lest this girl be taken care of (by someone else).\" (The phrase \"malama o\" implies a warning or precaution to prevent something, often translated as \"lest\" or \"in case\").\n*   **Makiioeoe:** Another chiefly name.\n*   **i ke aumoe:** \"at midnight\".\n*   **hoala aku la:** \"awoke him\" (caused him to arise/wake).\n*   **aia maluna pono o ka puoa i paa ai ke kaikamahine:** \"there right above the tower where the girl is confined\" (puoa is a tower or raised platform; paa means confined or"
