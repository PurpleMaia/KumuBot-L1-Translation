  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",
  "deepseek-r1-0528-dsapi_translation": "Here is the English translation of the Hawaiian text, wrapped in the requested tags:\n\n<translation>On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia came again to the woman. But this was the reason for its coming. The mother looked at the daughter and said: \"Ah, we two are the true loved ones of the blood bone, not your father of the boneless kind.\" Pumaia said: \"What are you two murmuring about?\" \"Nothing, we are just talking idly about death, not about you, the boneless one.\" Pumaia said to the woman: \"Let us go; open [the way] for me and take me along.\" They ascended from Pukoula to the open space of Pauoa, traveling on until reaching the water of Alekoki, from there to Maemae; thus they climbed until the sea became choppy at the time of late morning, and they arrived at Nuuanu.</translation>\n\n**Key Translation Notes:**\n1.  **I ka lua o ka po:** \"On the second night\" (literally \"the second of the night\").\n2.  **ka iwi koko / ka iwi koko 'ole:** \"The blood bone\" refers to a true, direct blood relative. \"The boneless kind\" refers to someone *not* a true blood relative, implying a lesser connection or even a spirit/ghost lacking physical substance. This is a core concept in the dialogue.\n3.  **E mea wale ae ana no maua i ka make:** \"We are just talking idly/idly conversing about death.\" `mea wale` implies idle, trivial, or insignificant talk.\n4.  **E wehe ia’u a lawe pu:** \"Open [the way] for me and take me along.\" `wehe` (to open) likely refers to opening a pathway for the spirit or granting permission/access. `lawe pū` means to take along.\n5.  **owakawaka kai ao o ke kakahiaka nui:** \"The sea became choppy at the time of late morning.\" `owakawaka` describes the sea as choppy or rippled. `ao` means daylight/dawn. `ke kakahiaka nui` is late morning, around 9-10 AM. This phrase poetically marks the time of day during their journey."
