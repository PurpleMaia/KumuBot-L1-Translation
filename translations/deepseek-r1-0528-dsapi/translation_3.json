  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",
  "deepseek-r1-0528-dsapi_translation": "Here is the English translation of the Hawaiian text:\n\n<translation>On the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele ascended to the place of the koa canoe trees, the place where birds call, carrying the adze wrapped in ti leaves. When they arrived right beneath the trunk of that koa tree, Kauakahi sat apart with the ti-leaf-wrapped adze. Then, Keawenuiaumi's canoe carvers cut down the trunk of the koa tree. At that moment, birds alighted and cried out: \"Alas, Keawenuiaumi! No canoe, just rot. It is a bad canoe, a rotten canoe. It is a canoe unfit for the ocean.\"</translation>\n\n**Key Translation Notes:**\n*   **I ka lua o ka lā:** \"On the second day\" (lua = second)\n*   **pii:** ascended, went up\n*   **koa waa:** Koa tree specifically used/grown for canoes\n*   **kahi o ke koa waa, a na manu e hea ai:** \"The place of the koa canoe trees, the place where birds call\" (descriptive location)\n*   **hokeo ie:** Adze (woodworking tool) wrapped/protected in ti (ki) leaves\n*   **auamo ia:** Carried (specifically on the shoulder or by bearing)\n*   **noho kaawale aku la:** Sat apart, sat separately\n*   **ooki:** Cut down, felled (specifically for trees/wood)\n*   **kalai waa:** Canoe carvers/craftsmen\n*   **kau ana na manu, kahea ana:** The birds alighted/perched and cried out/called.\n*   **E:** Interjection expressing emotion, translated here as \"Alas!\"\n*   **Aohe waa, he puha:** \"No canoe, just rot/hollowness/decay.\" (Puha implies rotten, hollow, worthless).\n*   **He waa ino, he waa puha:** \"It is a bad canoe, a rotten canoe.\"\n*   **He waa hiki ole i ka moana:** \"It is a canoe unfit/incapable for the ocean.\" (hiki ole = cannot, is unable; i ka moana = for the ocean)."
