  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair.",

Before eating, Pikoiakaalala said: \"All of you listen, I have a little law for eating, like this: 'No talking, no whispering, no gesturing, no pinching, no murmuring, until my eating is finished.'\"\nHe grabbed the pig, one bite, the sweet potato poi, one swallow, and gulped it down. He grabbed again, until nearly the entire separate pig and all the food from the oven were gone.\nOne man remarked: \"It's the food of the god.\" He stopped then.\nThe sisters responded: \"Stopped? What about the eating?\"\n\"No, I am satisfied already.\"\n\"Yes, we also heard your law,\" so said the sisters.\nAfter this eating by Pikoiakaalala, his body grew and he became a big and handsome man, but the hair was rat's hair.</translation>\n\n**Key Translation Notes:**\n*   **Pikoiakaalala:** Name of the protagonist.\n*   **Kaikoeke:** Translated as \"sisters\" (specifically, sisters of a brother).\n*   **Moa ka puaa a me ka ai:** \"The pig was cooked and the food was ready.\" (`moa` means cooked, especially by baking/roasting).\n*   **Kanawai:** Translated as \"law\" or \"rule\" in this context of establishing eating etiquette.\n*   **Aohe walaau... a pau kuu paina ana:** The series of prohibitions (`aohe` = no) against talking, whispering, gesturing, etc., ending with \"until my eating is finished.\"\n*   **Hookahi kaka... hookahi nau ana, a moni:** Describes the rapid, large bites and swallows - \"one bite... one swallow, and gulped it down.\"\n*   **Puaa okoa:** \"The separate pig\" (likely meaning the whole pig reserved for him, or the pig distinct from the other food).\n*   **Ka umu:** The underground oven used for cooking.\n*   **He ai na ke Akua:** \"It's the food of the god\" - a remark highlighting the astonishing amount eaten.\n*   **Ua maona ae la no:** \"I am satisfied already\" (`maona` = satisfied, full from eating).\n*   **Ua pii kona kino a lilo i kanaka nui a me ka maikai:** \"His body grew and he became a big and handsome man\" - describing a physical transformation after eating.\n*   **O ka lauoho"
