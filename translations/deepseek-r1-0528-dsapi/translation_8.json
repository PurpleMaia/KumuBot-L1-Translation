He waa ia. Kuku ia ke kapa a iako, hahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he iako? He iako. Lawaia ka ia a loaa he ama, hahahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he ama? He ama ia.”",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”",
  "deepseek-r1-0528-dsapi_translation": "Here is the English translation of the Hawaiian dialogue:\n\n<translation>The elders said: \"Fibbing child; can the whole canoe really be inside the calabash, including the boom and the outrigger float?\"\nThe child replied: \"If bark cloth is beaten until it's coarse and bulky, and stuffed into the calabash, is that not a canoe? It is a canoe. If bark cloth is beaten into a boom shape and stuffed into the calabash, is that not a boom? It is a boom. If one fishes and catches a fish that serves as an outrigger float, and it is stuffed into the calabash, is that not an outrigger float? It is an outrigger float.\"</translation>\n\n**Breakdown of Key Terms:**\n*   **Olelo mai na kanaka makua:** The elders said\n*   **Keiki wahahee:** Fibbing child / Lying child\n*   **Pau no ka waa iloko o ka ipu:** The whole canoe is inside the calabash?\n*   **e laa me ka iako, ke ama?:** Including the boom and the outrigger float?\n*   **I aku ke keiki:** The child replied\n*   **Kuku ia ke kapa:** Bark cloth is beaten (prepared by pounding)\n*   **a kiwaawaa:** until coarse/bulky (representing the canoe hull)\n*   **hao iloko o ka ipu:** stuffed into the calabash\n*   **aole ia la he waa? He waa ia:** Is that not a canoe? It is a canoe.\n*   **Kuku ia ke kapa a iako:** Bark cloth is beaten into a boom\n*   **aole ia la he iako? He iako:** Is that not a boom? It is a boom.\n*   **Lawaia ka ia:** Fish for a fish\n*   **a loaa he ama:** and obtain an outrigger float (using a fish as a symbolic representation)\n*   **hahahao ia iloko o ka ipu:** stuffed into the calabash (variant spelling of *hao*)\n*   **aole ia la he ama? He ama ia:** Is that not an outrigger float? It is an outrigger float.\n\nThe child cleverly uses symbolic representations (coarse bark cloth for the canoe hull and boom, a caught fish for the outrigger float) to justify the claim that the \"whole canoe\" is contained within the calabash."
