When Ama'u and his people arrived at 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o emerged from the entire land, leaving no people behind, and Ama'u was killed. Thus, O'ahu was filled by Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then she went to her mother and established herself on the land of O'ahu.",
  "qwen3-32b-fp8-think-parser-deepinfra_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nAma'u spotted, and he prepared twelve canoes, each a large double-hulled type, and set out to the south of 'Ewa to confront Nāmakaokapāo'o. When Ama'u and his people arrived at 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o emerged from the entire land, leaving no people behind, and Ama'u was killed. Thus, O'ahu was filled by Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then she went to her mother and established herself on the land of O'ahu.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\nThis passage is part of the broader Hawaiian mythological narrative centered on Nāmakaokapāo'o, a shark goddess and avenger of her mother, the volcano goddess Pele. The text describes Nāmakaokapāo'o's conquest of O'ahu after a conflict with the warrior Ama'u, illustrating themes of divine retribution and the interplay between human and supernatural forces in Hawaiian cosmology. The narrative is embedded within traditional oral histories that use natural and cultural landmarks (e.g., 'Ewa, O'ahu) to convey lessons about power, resilience, and the interconnectedness of land and people. Linguistically, the passage employs archaic terms like \"kumamāwalu\" (a type of large canoe) and \"makuahine\" (mother), reflecting the rich lexicon of Hawaiian oral tradition.",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
