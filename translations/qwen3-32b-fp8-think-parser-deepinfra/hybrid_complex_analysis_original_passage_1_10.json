At that time, the chief ‘Ama‘u resided at Waikīkī. One day, a man from Honouliuli arrived at Waikīkī to visit the chief. He spoke to ‘Ama‘u: “O chief! This is a fine place for a strong child to grow up. Her father has died, and her head was placed in the ocean, a long distance away—five miles long.” When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he thought to himself, “She is very strong; I will kill her. But I will not kill her, for she is not strong.” As he spoke these words in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard them.",
  "qwen3-32b-fp8-think-parser-deepinfra_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nAfter Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to her mother, Pōka‘ī, and they settled in the area. Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat the food provided. At that time, the chief ‘Ama‘u resided at Waikīkī. One day, a man from Honouliuli arrived at Waikīkī to visit the chief. He spoke to ‘Ama‘u: “O chief!

Her father has died, and her head was placed in the ocean, a long distance away—five miles long.” When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he thought to himself, “She is very strong; I will kill her. But I will not kill her, for she is not strong.” As he spoke these words in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard them.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a traditional Hawaiian narrative that explores themes of power, conflict, and the moral complexities of leadership. The story centers on Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a figure often associated with the legendary ali‘i (chief) of O‘ahu, and her interactions with ‘Ama‘u, another prominent chief. The dialogue reflects the use of *ōlelo no‘eau* (Hawaiian proverbs or figurative speech) to convey threats and challenges, a hallmark of pre-contact Hawaiian oral tradition. The mention of Waikīkī and Honouliuli situates the narrative within specific geographic and political contexts of O‘ahu, emphasizing the interconnectedness of place and power in Hawaiian society. The passage also hints at a larger story involving Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s resilience and the tensions between ali‘i during a period of shifting alliances and territorial disputes.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
