  "qwen3-32b-fp8-think-parser-deepinfra_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nNāmakaokapāo'o spoke: \"I have seen, indeed I am a great person, Nāmakaokapāo'o, and now I am going to Ko'olau, and I am his name.\" They replied: \"No, it is you, as we have heard, therefore you will die by us, you will not live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Return, return our breaths down below to be released.\" When they descended, Nāmakaokapāo'o died completely, and only you, a man, who ran and found 'Ama'u in Waikīkī, spoke the death of all of them, and you made a great sound to be heard by 'Ama'u.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\nThis passage is part of a larger narrative involving the Hawaiian figure Nāmakaokapāo'o, a revered chief or deity associated with the Ko'olau mountain range and the Waikīkī region. The dialogue reflects a confrontation where Nāmakaokapāo'o asserts his identity and power, only to be challenged by others who threaten his life. The mention of \"breaths\" (hā) and the act of descending to the underworld (i lalo) suggests a ritualistic or supernatural element, possibly tied to traditional Hawaiian concepts of life, death, and spiritual transformation. The reference to 'Ama'u, a figure in Waikīkī, indicates a regional mythic connection, likely involving conflict, sacrifice, or the establishment of sacred sites. The narrative exemplifies the interplay between oral tradition, geography, and spiritual authority in Hawaiian cosmology.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
