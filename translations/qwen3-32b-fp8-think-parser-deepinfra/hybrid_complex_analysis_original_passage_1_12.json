In the first group there was a warrior named Kanahā Kumamāwalu, and similarly in the other three groups. They arrived at the district of Keahumoa, entered the house, but found no people inside. They were about to retreat when Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from the roof. They heard the voice, but could not see the body, and asked: \"Where are you hiding?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied: \"Here I am above.\" Immediately, eight people appeared—four on the eaves of the house and four on the ceiling—and Nāmakaokapāo'o was revealed. Nāmakaokapāo'o asked: \"What is your reason for coming here?\" They replied: \"We came to confront you, Nāmakaokapāo'o, because you are a powerful, youthful figure like yourself, strong and valiant. It was you who killed your father, Puali'i.\"",
  "qwen3-32b-fp8-think-parser-deepinfra_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The story reflects themes of supernatural power, conflict, and the tension between ali'i (chiefly) authority and mystical forces. Nāmakaokapāo'o is often depicted as a formidable character who challenges others through her strategic use of illusions and physical prowess. The passage occurs during a confrontation between her and a group of warriors sent by 'Ama'u, a chief from Waikīkī. The narrative is embedded in a broader cultural context of moʻolelo (Hawaiian stories) that often blend historical events with mythological elements, emphasizing values such as bravery, cunning, and the interplay between the human and spiritual realms. The use of specific place names like Keahumoa and the detailed description of the warriors' formation underscore the importance of geography and ritual in traditional Hawaiian storytelling.",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
