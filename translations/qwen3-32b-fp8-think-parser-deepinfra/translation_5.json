At this one of the guards said to his companion: “Say, this must be Laukiamanuikahiki, the king’s own daughter.” The other replied: “No, this cannot be the one, for she was to come in a red canoe having red sails, red paddles, red men, a large canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men; these I understand are the things that should accompany her; this girl on the other hand is a poor girl for she has come without any of these things.” The two again listened to the conversation between the owl and girl. After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter.

One said to another: \"Hey, this girl is the one from the chief, Laukiamanuikahiki.\" Another said: \"No, it's not her; her canoe is red, her paddle is red, her oar is red, her person is red, a large canoe, a small canoe, a long canoe, a tall person, a short person, she will come again, this is not the girl they are looking for.\" They listened again to the words of the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki. \"Let us not speak to the chief, for the girl is this one.\" One said: \"Yes.\" They approached the chief, Makiioeoe, and said: \"Here she is, walk forward.\" \"Where?\" asked Makiioeoe. \"An owl, it is perched on the branch where the girl was tied. Thus spoke the owl, and we heard the call from the girl.\"</translation>"
