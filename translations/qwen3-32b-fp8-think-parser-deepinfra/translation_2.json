At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”",

A pahoa stood in the opening of the house, and it was established. Keinohoomanawanui spoke to Kalelealuaka: \"Let us die! Here is a pahoa in the opening of our house! It has arrived. We love death; it is I who speak to you to let the child go, for there is no death in the message.\"  \n</translation>"
