  "qwen3-32b-fp8-think-parser-deepinfra_translation": "Puali‘i ran with the plantain and arrived in the middle where Nāmakaokapāo‘o was about to roast four stalks of plantain over the fire. All the children saw this, and they ran and gathered in a long line to confront Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! Here is the plantain in my hand, a special item reserved for the chief today. I shall cook it, I shall eat it first, and then you may have it.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not heed Puali‘i’s words, so Puali‘i spoke again, the second time. Puali‘i brandished the plantain at Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and at that moment, Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s power over Puali‘i was broken. Thus it was broken:  \n“Only the face of my place of honor is love,  \nLet it collapse, let it fall apart now,  \nLet it be eaten, or let it be left,  \nLet it be left, O Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,  \nThat is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,  \nThis is my honored place,  \nO Nāmakaokai‘a, the great chief of Hawai‘i,  \nFall away, fall away like the tide,  \nThe people are but the sea,  \nThe sea is but the wave,  \nAnd Nāmakaokapāo‘o perished.”",
  "qwen3-32b-fp8-think-parser-deepinfra_commentary": "This passage is a vivid example of Hawaiian oral tradition, blending narrative, dialogue, and poetic invocation to convey themes of power, defiance, and the dissolution of authority.  \n\n**Cultural Context**  \n1. **Mythological Figures**:  \n   - **Puali‘i** is a semi-legendary figure in Hawaiian lore, often depicted as a cunning warrior or trickster. His actions here reflect a common trope in Polynesian mythology where lower-status individuals outwit or challenge high-ranking chiefs (ali‘i).  \n   - **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** is a high chief (ali‘i nui) whose name may derive from *nāmaka* (shame, disgrace) and *kapāo‘o* (to be powerful). His defeat symbolizes the fragility of hierarchical power when confronted by cleverness or defiance.  \n\n2. **Ritual and Food Significance**:  \n   - The **plantain (ko‘ilipi)** is central to the narrative. In Hawaiian culture, food items like plantains were not only sustenance but also had ceremonial value. By taking the plantain reserved for the chief (*kō po‘o*), Puali‘i violates protocols of *kapu* (sacred restrictions), asserting his agency over a system of rigid social stratification.  \n   - The act of cooking and eating (*kālua me ka ‘uala*) underscores the material and symbolic importance of food in Hawaiian society, where access to resources often mirrored social hierarchy.  \n\n3. **Power and Mana**:  \n   - The chant at the end uses natural metaphors (moon, sea, waves) to deconstruct Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s *mana* (spiritual power). This reflects Hawaiian cosmology, where authority is tied to cosmic order (*lōkahi*). The chief’s power is likened to transient natural forces, emphasizing its impermanence.  \n\n**Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Poetic Structure**:  \n   - The chant employs **parallelism** and **repetition** (e.g., *E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha*), a hallmark of Hawaiian poetic tradition. This structure reinforces the inevitability of the chief’s downfall.  \n   - **Alliteration** and **compound names** (e.g., *Nākukui‘aimakaokalani*) showcase the rhythmic and mnemonic qualities of Hawaiian language, aiding oral transmission.  \n\n2. **Lexical Nuances**:  \n   - *Kō po‘o* (reserved for the chief) highlights the *kapu* system, which governed social and ritual boundaries. Puali‘i’s defiance of this system is a radical act of subversion.  \n   - The verb *kālua* (to cook in an earth oven) is culturally specific, linking the narrative to traditional Hawaiian cooking practices (*kālua* is still used in modern *kālua pig* preparations).  \n\n**Historical Significance**  \n1. **Social Critique**:  \n   - The story critiques the vulnerability of centralized power in Hawaiian society. By having a commoner (*kānaka*) dismantle a chief’s authority through wit and ritual, the narrative reflects historical tensions between ali‘i and commoners, as well as the fluidity of power in pre-contact Hawaii.  \n\n2. **Oral Tradition**:  \n   - The blend of narrative and chant mirrors how stories were preserved in Hawaiian oral culture. The poetic form serves both to entertain and to encode moral or political lessons, ensuring their transmission across generations.  \n\n3. **Myth as History**:  \n   - While rooted in myth, this passage may reflect real historical dynamics. The decline of ali‘i power in the 19th century (e.g., under Kamehameha I) often involved similar confrontations between centralized authority and grassroots movements.  \n\nThis passage is a microcosm of Hawaiian cultural values: the interplay of *mana* and *kapu*, the centrality of food and ritual, and the enduring power of oral storytelling to challenge and redefine social hierarchies.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
