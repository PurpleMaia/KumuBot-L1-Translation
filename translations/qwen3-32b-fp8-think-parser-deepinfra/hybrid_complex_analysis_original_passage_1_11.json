Then Nāmakaokapāo’o leapt up onto the mat of the house, split open the ridgepole and thatched roof, and slept there, lying in the middle above the mat.",
  "qwen3-32b-fp8-think-parser-deepinfra_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nThen, he took his wife anxiously to the stream of Waipouli. The wife disappeared and returned to their house in Keahumoa, where she stayed. Then Nāmakaokapāo’o leapt up onto the mat of the house, split open the ridgepole and thatched roof, and slept there, lying in the middle above the mat.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a larger narrative involving the shark goddess Nāmakaokapāo’o, a figure deeply rooted in Hawaiian mythology and oral tradition. The story likely explores themes of transformation, divine intervention, and the interplay between human and spiritual realms. Nāmakaokapāo’o, often associated with the moon and the ocean, is depicted here as a powerful, shape-shifting entity who disrupts the domestic space (symbolized by the house’s structure) to assert her presence. The specific locations—Waipouli (a stream) and Keahumoa (a region in Kaua‘i)—anchor the tale in a geographically and culturally significant context. The splitting of the house’s ridgepole and thatched roof (kua and alo) reflects traditional Hawaiian architectural elements, emphasizing the sacredness of these structures and their vulnerability to supernatural forces. The narrative may also allude to broader cosmological concepts, such as the fluid boundaries between the physical and spiritual worlds.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
