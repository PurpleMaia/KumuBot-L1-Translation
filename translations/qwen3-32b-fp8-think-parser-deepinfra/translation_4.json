  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",

The mother looked at the daughter and said: \"U, we are not the beloved of the black bones, but the beloved of the non-black bones.\" Pumaia replied: \"How long will the two of you be hidden?\" \"No, we merely say that we are dead, we are not the non-black bones.\" Pumaia told the woman: \"Let us go; separate from me and take [them].\" They departed from Pukoula, passing by the edge of Pauoa, and traveled until they reached the waters of Alekoki, then to Maemae, as they journeyed across the vast sea of the great valley, arriving at Nuuanu.\n</translation>"
