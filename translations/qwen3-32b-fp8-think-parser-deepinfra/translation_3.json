  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",
  "qwen3-32b-fp8-think-parser-deepinfra_translation": "\n\n<translation>On the day of their arrival in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele were fishing at a place where the sea was rough, and the birds were flying about, when the canoe was overturned by the waves. Then they swam down to the base of this rough sea, and Kauakahi took shelter with the waves. At that time, Keawenuiaumi struck the base of the rough sea, the birds perched, and he called out: “Hey, Keawenuiaumi! There are no waves, it is calm. It is a calm wave, a gentle wave. It is a wave that cannot reach the ocean.”</translation>"
