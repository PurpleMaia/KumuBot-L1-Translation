  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo.",

Upon his birth, his body stretched to the length, and his house of Halauoloolo stretched as well; from the birth, as his long body extended into the sea, the house of Halauoloolo grew accordingly.\n</translation>"
