  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair.",

After eating, Pikoiakaalala said, \"Listen to me all, my eating place is a sacred place, like this: no bones, no gristle, no sinew, no fat, no gristle, all my eating is done.\" He began eating the pig, first the leg, then the sweet potato, then the head, then the tail, and completely finished the pig's tail and all the food in the oven. A person said, \"This food is from the gods.\" Another person asked, \"How does the return happen when eating?\" \"No, it was already hidden,\" he replied. \"Yes, we have heard your sacred rule,\" said the person. During Pikoiakaalala's eating, his body was struck and he disappeared from the people and the good, the chief was a chief of the gods.</translation>"
