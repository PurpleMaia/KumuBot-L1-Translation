  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_translation": "“Here is a little account of those two names, namely Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, they were great chiefs for Hawai‘i, Nāmakaokalani was his father and Nāmakaokai‘a was his son. However, he entered into the time of Nāmakaokapāo’o.”",
  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_commentary": "• **Introduction of Characters:** The passage introduces two significant figures: Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, both established as prominent chiefs within the context of Hawai'i.  The naming conventions—Nāmaka- –are common in Hawaiian genealogical accounts and often signify a connection to the ocean and powerful deities, linking these figures to ancestral roles as guardians or embodiments of natural forces. The repetition of ‘Nāmaka’ suggests a shared lineage or perhaps a significant influence from a shared ancestor.\n\n• **Family Relationships:**  The passage establishes a clear familial hierarchy: Nāmakaokalani is the father of Nāmakaokai‘a. This structure echoes common patterns in Hawaiian genealogy, where descent and authority flowed through male lines. The emphasis on paternal lineage underscores the importance of patrilineal succession within social organization.\n\n• **Temporal Context – ‘The Time of Nāmakaokapāo’o’:**  Crucially, this passage immediately introduces a temporal marker—“the time of Nāmakaokapāo'o.” This is not merely a statement of chronology; it establishes a critical shift in the narrative landscape.  This phrase acts as a framing device, suggesting that events surrounding Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a unfold within a specific historical period marked by the presence (and potentially influence) of Nāmakaokapāo'o. This is an incredibly important detail, as it immediately sets up a dynamic between these three figures – the elder chiefs, their son, and the younger, powerful boy.\n\n• **Symbolic Significance of Names:** The names themselves hold potential symbolic weight. “Nāmakaokalani” suggests someone connected to the depths (nā-maka) and the horizon (o-kalani), possibly representing a connection between the terrestrial and oceanic realms or a chief who ruled over expansive territories. \"Nāmakaokai‘a\" is similarly linked to the ocean (nā-maka), but the addition of ‘kai’ – sea – likely signifies his role as protector/guardian of the coast, perhaps even a master navigator.  \n\n• **‘Ai Kapu and Transition:** It's highly plausible that this “time” refers to a period where 'Ai Kapu (sacred law) practices were either challenged or shifting. The introduction of Nāmakaokapāo’o—described in previous passages as a powerful, potentially destructive force—would have initiated significant social disruption and possibly a breakdown of established traditions. The phrase \"entered into the time...\" suggests that Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a are now navigating a world fundamentally altered by this younger figure's actions.  This period likely saw a move away from traditional 'Ai Kapu practices, leading to potentially dangerous consequences as seen in previous passages involving the destruction of sweet potatoes.\n\n• **Allegorical Implications:** The passage serves as an introduction to a narrative arc where lineage and power are intertwined with historical change. It establishes a framework for understanding how individual figures – particularly Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a - grapple with the consequences of this temporal shift and potentially challenge or succumb to its disruptive forces.  The focus on genealogical relationships highlights the importance of ancestry in shaping identity and social standing within Hawaiian society.",

  "reference_translation": "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity."
