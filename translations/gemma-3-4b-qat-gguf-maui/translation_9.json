  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession.",
  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_translation": "Here's the translation of the Hawaiian text:\n\n<translation>The waters of Waiakea flow to Hilo, and Halepaki is the dream, Wailea is the mother. Wailea is a descendant, of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, who dwelled in Kohala. Kaipalaoa was born great, his mother traveled to Kauai, and he died Kalanialiiloa, a sacred reef for Kauai, a wise reef in its teachings, where the remains of people, of Halepaiwi, are now buried – a place that surrounds you completely. Halepaki knew of the teachings, and he waited patiently, not becoming angry, and then traveled to Kauai and died Kalanialiiloa. The reef of Pueonuiokona is in Kauai.</translation>"
