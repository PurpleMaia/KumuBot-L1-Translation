  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_translation": "“The land on ‘Ewa (West) was where they experienced a misfortune, because of lying down and becoming pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Then Pōka‘ī gave birth to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, and Pōka‘ī remained with her giving birth, and afterward, they had a child. In this birth, Pōka‘ī was very healthy and well along with her child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”",
  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_commentary": "• **Opening Statement & Geographic Context:** The passage begins by establishing the initial misfortune—a “kina kino” (bad experience)—experienced on the ‘Ewa side of Hawai‘i. This sets the stage for understanding the subsequent events as part of a larger narrative arc, likely involving lineage and ancestral connections. 'Ewa is traditionally considered one of the most fertile regions in Hawai'i, known for its abundance of resources. \n\n• **Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s Birth & Family Dynamics:** The core event—the birth of Nāmakaokapāo‘o—is presented directly.  The phrasing “launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a” (experienced a misfortune because of lying down and becoming pregnant) is evocative, suggesting a somewhat challenging or unexpected pregnancy – perhaps a loss or difficult delivery. This immediately establishes Nāmakaokapāo'ō’s origins as being intertwined with a significant event.\n\n• **Kauluakaha‘i’s Return & Pōka‘ī's Continued Role:**  The return of Kauluakaha‘i to his land is important. It signifies a resumption of family connections and a restoration of lineage. The emphasis on Pōka‘ī “ma hope” (afterward) remaining with Nāmakaokapāo‘o underscores her continuing role as mother and caregiver. This highlights the strong bonds within families, particularly female kinship networks—a cornerstone of Hawaiian society.\n\n• **Pōka‘ī's Health & the Birth:** The description of Pōka‘ī as “he ‘ilihune loa” (very healthy) is crucial.  In pre-contact Hawai’i, a mother’s health was inextricably linked to her child’s well-being—her vitality directly influenced the child's development and strength. This shows how deeply rooted were the practices of 'Ai Kapu when it came to women and children.\n\n• **Name Etymologies & Significance:**  Let's consider the names:\n    *   **Nāmakaokapāo’o:** The name itself is rich with meaning. *Nāmaka* refers to the goddess of the underworld, associated with darkness, the sea, and hidden treasures. *Okapo* likely relates to “eyes” or “vision”, perhaps referencing a captivating or striking appearance.  The suffix *-o'o* often signifies strength or power. Thus, Nāmakaokapāo’o embodies a formidable presence from birth.\n    *   **Kauluakaha‘i:** This name carries the sense of “inspiration,” “source of guidance,” or \"footstep.\" *Kaulu* suggests something originating or emanating from a source.  *Aha'i* means “hero” or “a person who has traveled far.” It’s fitting for a character who returns to his homeland—a symbol of reconnection and lineage.\n    *   **Pōka‘ī:** The name *pō* signifies \"night,\" while *kai* represents the ocean.  Therefore, Pōka‘ī translates to “night-of-the-sea,” suggesting a connection to the mysteries and power of the ocean—a realm often associated with ancestral spirits in Hawaiian beliefs.\n\n• **Cultural Context: ‘Ai Kapu & Lineage:** This passage implicitly references 'Ai Kapu practices. The emphasis on lineage, the importance of returning to one's homeland, and the mother’s health all point to the complex social structure based on kinship, ritual obligations, and ancestral connections.  The seemingly simple event of childbirth is framed within a web of cultural significance—it represents not just the creation of a new individual but also the continuity of a family line and the maintenance of sacred practices. The fact that Kauluakaha'i returns to his *‘āina* (land) underscores the importance of place in Hawaiian identity.\n\n• **Allegorical Interpretation:**  The passage can be interpreted as a microcosm of the larger narrative—a story about origins, lineage, and the challenges faced by a new generation within an established cultural context. The \"misfortune\" sets the stage for future conflicts or transformations, while Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s strength and his mother's health promise a bright future for his family.",

  "reference_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",

When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
