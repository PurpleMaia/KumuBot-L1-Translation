  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said: “I know, he is a great man, Nāmakaokapāo'o, and he has come down from Ko'olau, and I am his name.” They replied: \"No, you are it, therefore you will kill us, not you will live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: “Let’s go down and fight together.” They went down, with Nāmakaokapāo'o fading away, completely dying, leaving only one man, who was then named ‘Ama’u in Waikīkī. He spoke of their deaths entirely, and ‘Ama’u heard it.",
  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "Here’s an analysis of the provided Hawaiian passage from Chapter 1, Paragraph 13:\n\n<translation>Nāmakaokapāo'o said: “I know, he is a great man, Nāmakaokapāo'o, and he has come down from Ko'olau, and I am his name.” They replied: \"No, you are it, therefore you will kill us, not you will live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: “Let’s go down and fight together.” They went down, with Nāmakaokapāo'o fading away, completely dying, leaving only one man, who was then named ‘Ama’u in Waikīkī. He spoke of their deaths entirely, and ‘Ama’u heard it.</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• **Narrative Context & Dramatic Tension:** This passage marks a crucial shift in the narrative – the immediate escalation of conflict and loss. Nāmakaokapāo'o’s declaration that he is “a great man” immediately establishes his importance and foreshadows the potential for significant action, highlighting the protagonist’s growing stature even as he faces imminent death. The repetition of \"‘o ‘oe e make ai iā mākou\" (you will kill us) underscores the desperation and threat posed by Nāmakaokapāo'o, intensifying the dramatic tension.\n\n• **Names & Genealogy:**  The passage is filled with significant naming practices crucial to understanding Hawaiian culture:\n    – *Nāmakaokapāo'o*: The name itself— Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o – offers a wealth of symbolic meaning. \"Nā-maka\" refers to the eyes of the pāo’o (a type of fish), connecting him to vision, power, and possibly prophecy. “Ka-pāo’o” translates roughly to 'eyes', representing insight or awareness.  The name suggests an individual with extraordinary perception and a potentially dangerous influence.\n    – *Ko'olau*: “Ko’olau” refers to the mountain range where Nāmakaokapāo’o has traveled from, suggesting he is journeying from a more remote, wild territory to Waikīkī – a symbolic movement towards civilization or confrontation.  It also represents a specific geographic location with its own cultural and historical significance.\n    – *‘Ama’u*: The name ‘Ama’u (or Ama'u) signifies \"the one who is heard\" or \"the echo,\" reflecting the narrative function of this character – he becomes the sole witness to their deaths, carrying their stories forward.  This highlights the importance of oral tradition in Hawaiian society.\n    – *Pualai*: The name Pualai (not included in the passage) is a common female name and is associated with the hibiscus flower which represents beauty, grace, and love; this would likely be the name of Nāmakaokapāo'o’s mother or a significant female figure within his life.\n\n• **‘Ai Kapu and Sacrifice:** The threat to “kill us” directly alludes to the *‘Ai Kapu* system – the sacred order of Hawai’i that strictly regulated interactions between people, the natural world, and the deities.  The act of killing is a profound transgression against *‘Ai Kapu*, symbolizing a disruption of the established balance and hierarchy. The phrase “ho'i aku ho'i hā kākou i lalo e hakakā ai” (\"Let’s go down and fight together\") suggests a challenge to the established order, a rejection of the rules imposed by the gods or ancestral authority.  The fact that they \"go down\" implies a descent into a darker realm – both physically and symbolically – signifying a confrontation with powerful forces.\n\n• **Symbolism of Death & Echoes:** Nāmakaokapāo'o’s “fading away, completely dying” is not merely physical death; it represents the erasure of their identities, traditions, and lineage. He becomes an 'echo' - ‘Ama’u, who then carries those stories. This echoes a common theme in Hawaiian narratives: even when individuals perish, their deeds and memories are preserved through oral tradition. The act of ‘Ama’u hearing their deaths signifies that they will not be forgotten; their stories live on through the storyteller.  The use of 'echo' (‘āha'ilono) as the final verb reinforces this theme.\n\n• **Allegorical Interpretation:** This passage functions allegorically, representing a struggle between tradition and change. Nāmakaokapāo’o represents a force of disruption – challenging established norms through his actions and threatening to dismantle the sacred order (*‘Ai Kapu*). The threat to “kill us” embodies the potential consequences of rejecting this order and venturing into uncharted territory. ‘Ama’u, as the keeper of these stories, symbolizes the preservation of cultural memory in the face of loss— a vital role for descendants within Hawaiian society; a way to keep the spirit alive and ensure that the past is not forgotten.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
