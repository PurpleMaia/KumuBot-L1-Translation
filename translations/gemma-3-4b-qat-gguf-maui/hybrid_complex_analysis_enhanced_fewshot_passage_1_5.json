  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_translation": "Puali‘i was fishing on the shore when Nāmakaokapāo‘o came with twelve children to Puali‘i’s sweet potato patches. Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s body at that time was a very small body, two spans wide and half its height, not fully grown, and it continued to shrink. When they reached the sweet potato patch, the children told them, \"Dig up the mound with sweet potato leaves completely until they are all on top, do not leave any growing.\" However, the children were impatient, so they just looked at the sweet potatoes and didn't dig up the mound.",
  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_commentary": "• **Paragraph 1 - Introduction of Characters and Setting:** The passage immediately introduces two primary characters: Puali‘i, a fisherman (lawai’a), and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, accompanied by twelve children.  The setting is clearly established as Puali‘i’s sweet potato patches (māla ‘uala). The description of Nāmakaokapao'o’s body immediately establishes the child’s physical vulnerability – his size and apparent lack of growth are emphasized. This detail foreshadows themes of childhood, vulnerability, and perhaps even the disruption of established order.\n\n– **The Significance of *Māla* (Patch):**  In pre-contact Hawaiian society, *māla* were not simply fields; they represented a vital connection to the land—a sacred space where cultivation and spiritual well-being intertwined. The act of “digging up” the *māla* is therefore more than just agriculture; it's an assertion of dominance or control over this sacred area – a common theme in narratives where childhood characters challenge established norms.\n\n• **Paragraph 2 - Conflict & Childish Impatience:** The passage establishes conflict immediately through the children’s action (or rather, inaction) and Puali‘i’s instruction. The command to \"completely dig up the mound\" is a clear directive. However, the children's response—simply looking at the sweet potatoes – reveals their impatience and lack of adherence to established protocols. This suggests a contrast between the adult world of rules and expectations (represented by Puali‘i) and the impulsive behavior of childhood.\n\n– **’Ai Kapu Practices & Protocol:** The instruction about \"not leaving any growing\" is heavily indicative of 'Ai Kapu practices, specifically related to land management and resource allocation.  Leaving new growth would disrupt the carefully maintained balance, a cornerstone of Hawaiian stewardship. This highlights the importance of ritual and adherence to tradition in daily life.\n\n• **Symbolic Analysis - Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s Physicality:** The description of Nāmakaokapāo'o as “a very small body, two spans wide and half its height” is laden with symbolic weight.  The physical characteristics—small size, lack of growth – mirror his status as a child and perhaps also suggest an outsider or someone struggling to fit into established patterns. The continued shrinking suggests a vulnerability, possibly highlighting the disruption he represents. It’s worth noting that Nāmakaokapāo'o is associated with darkness, water, and potentially chaos – elements that could be linked to his diminutive stature.\n\n• **Allegorical Interpretation – Childhood Disruption:** This passage foreshadows a narrative of childhood disrupting established order.  The children’s impatience and disregard for the instructions set in motion a series of events (implied in subsequent parts of the story, if it exists) that challenge the authority of Puali‘i and potentially threaten the balance of the *māla*. The focus on the sweet potato patch as a site of conflict suggests that this disruption has broader implications – perhaps relating to traditional practices or social hierarchies.  The seemingly simple act of digging up a patch becomes symbolic of challenging established norms.\n\n• **Cultural Context - ‘Ai Kapu:** This passage firmly establishes the importance of 'Ai Kapu (sacred order) in Hawaiian society. The instructions about clearing the *māla* reflect a system where land management was governed by strict protocols designed to maintain balance and harmony—both within the environment and within social relationships.  The children's disregard for this protocol hints at a potential clash between tradition and youth, or perhaps even the influence of external forces challenging established ways of life. The fact that Nāmakaokapāo’o is associated with darkness and water further enhances the symbolic weight of the scene – implying a primal force disrupting the established order.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
