  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair.",

Before the feast began, Pikoiakaalala spoke: “Everyone listen carefully, this is my rule for eating: no shouting, no boasting, no lying, no stealing, no anger – all of these are forbidden.” He then cut up the pig, one scoop of taro paste, one cup of honey, and continued to eat until the food was almost gone, along with the two pigs. One person said: “This is food from the gods.” Everyone agreed. Another asked: “Why is this food?” “No, it wasn’t stolen.” “Yes, we heard your rule,” replied the elders. At this feast of Pikoiakaalala, his body grew and he became a great and good man, with hair that was like dark ironwood.</translation>"
