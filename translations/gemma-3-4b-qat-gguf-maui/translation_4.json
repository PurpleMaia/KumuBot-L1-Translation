  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",
  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_translation": "Here's the translation of the Hawaiian text:\n\n<translation>At nightfall, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. However, the reason for this return was revealed. The mother took the girl and replied, “You, you are not the child of the red earth, it is not your father of the red earth.” Then Pumaia asked, \"What illness troubles you?\" \"No, it's only for creatures who die, you are not of the red earth.\" Pumaia then told the woman, \"Let us go; let him open the way and carry us.\" They journeyed from Pukoula to the slopes of Pauoa, eventually reaching the water of Alekoki, and then on to Maemae. Finally, they continued their journey, crossing the ocean at dawn, arriving in Nuuanu.</translation>"
