  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",

They had to go below the source of that old battle, and Kauakahi remained alone with his longing. That day, the dark birds of Keawenuiaumi went to the source of the battle, and they called out: “Keawenuiaumi! There is no color, it’s just emptiness. It's a terrible color, it’s just emptiness. It’s a color that cannot reach the sea.”</translation>"
