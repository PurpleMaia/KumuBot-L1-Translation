  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",
  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_translation": "Here's the English translation of the Hawaiian text, wrapped in `<translation>` tags:\n\nThe story is about Makiioeoe, whose mother was Hina (and who came from Kuaihelani), and she had a daughter named Kahikiula. From Kauai, Hina traveled, and when she arrived in Kauai, they slept together; and she became pregnant. That day, Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani and said to Hina: “I am leaving; you should give birth to a son, and he will take my name. And if you give birth to a daughter, she will take the name Laukiamanuikahiki. You will be raised greatly, and you will think of following me, here are the signs: a shark’s tooth necklace, a tapa cloth, a feather cloak, a large canoe, a small canoe, a great man, a small man, red color, blue color, dark blue color, whatever color, a colored man.” Makiioeoe told Kuaihelani about the characteristics of the daughter to be born, and about all the things belonging to Laukiamanuikahiki, her greatness and everything else; it was sacred and honored for Laukiamanuikahiki.\n\n<translation>"
