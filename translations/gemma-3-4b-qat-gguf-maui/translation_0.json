  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo.",

After being carried out, its body became weary, and its house of Halauoloolo also responded with weariness; from the land and close to the sea its body became weary, and then it remained for the sake of the dwelling, of Halauoloolo.</translation>"
