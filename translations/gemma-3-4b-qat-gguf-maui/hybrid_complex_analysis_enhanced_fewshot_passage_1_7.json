  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_translation": "Puali‘i angrily confronted Nāmakaokapāo‘o, who was roasting the four sweet potatoes over the fire. The children all gathered nearby, shocked by Puali‘i’s behavior.  Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Stop! This is a curse on my hand today, a death sentence for your head, so let us eat sweet potatoes together and I will eat you first, then, it is finished.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not heed Puali‘i’s words.  Puali‘i spoke again, saying that the sweet potato was a curse. Puali‘i was ready to curse Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the scroll, during the day that Nāmakaokapāo‘o would die for Puali‘i. This is how many days passed: My eyes look at you from afar,  Let them shrink, let them wither, Let us eat, or perhaps not, Perhaps we will abandon it,  The Chief of Hawai’i, Nāmakaokai‘a, the great chief,  Go to the west and go away, Let only sorrow remain, A man with a fish, The fish with a shell,  Kill Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_commentary": "• **Initial Scene Setting & Character Dynamics:** The passage immediately establishes a tense confrontation between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Puali‘i’s anger is palpable—expressed through the forceful, almost violent imagery of cursing the child. This sets up a conflict rooted in jealousy and perhaps a desire to possess Nāmakaokapāo‘o – this is likely due to his youthful beauty and strength, qualities that contrast with Puali‘i's perceived lack of power or status (he’s an inland man, while Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a local boy).\n\n• **The Significance of the Scroll (“Ko‘ilipi”):** The scroll – “ko‘ilipi” – is not merely a written document in this context. It represents a ‘Ai Kapu curse, a powerful invocation intended to bring about death or misfortune. In the 'Ai Kapu era (approximately 1700-1810), these curses were carefully administered and held immense weight within Hawaiian society, serving as both justice and retribution.  The use of a scroll adds an element of ritual formality and emphasizes the seriousness of Puali‘i’s threat.\n\n• **Symbolism of Sweet Potatoes (“ʻuala”):** The sweet potatoes themselves are laden with symbolic meaning. They represent sustenance, fertility, and perhaps even life itself. However, in this context, they become a vehicle for death—a perverse substitution for human sacrifice – representing the disruption of traditional practices.  The fact that Puali‘i intends to *eat* Nāmakaokapāo‘o – specifically his head and eyes – is profoundly disturbing and highlights the depth of his rage and desire for vengeance. The act of eating, in this context, becomes an act of desecration, turning a symbol of life into a tool of destruction.\n\n• **Nāmakaokapāo’o's Response & Impassivity:** Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s lack of reaction is crucial. He doesn’t argue or plead; he simply ignores Puali‘i’s curse, demonstrating his youth and perhaps an acceptance of fate – a characteristic often attributed to young children in Hawaiian storytelling. His silence underscores the power of the 'Ai Kapu and the futility of resistance against such forces.\n\n• **The Extended Metaphor (“Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o”):** The extended metaphor—\"My eyes look at you from afar, Let them shrink, let them wither\"—is particularly revealing. It suggests that Puali‘i’s gaze is not one of affection but of decay and destruction.  The imagery of shrinking and withering symbolizes the slow erosion of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s life force, mirroring Puali‘i's intention to bring about his demise.\n\n• **Nāmakaokapāo‘o's Identity & Ancestry:** The reference to “Nākukui‘aimakaokalani, ‘O Kukui‘aimakaokalani kēlā” – referencing the Chief Nāmakaokai‘a (“the great chief”) and his lineage – serves to highlight Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s noble birth and connection to an ancient lineage. This subtly reinforces his status as a figure worthy of protection, even in the face of Puali‘i's threat. He is not just a boy; he is the descendant of a revered chief.\n\n• **The Final Line (“Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o”):**  This final line – “Kill Nāmakaokapāo‘o” – delivers the chilling climax of the passage, confirming Puali‘i’s deadly intent and setting the stage for a tragic outcome. The repetition emphasizes the gravity of the threat. It signifies a complete rejection of all traditional ways and an embrace of violence as a means of achieving personal desires. This is the culmination of the 'Ai Kapu conflict – a battle between maintaining ancient traditions and succumbing to destructive impulses.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
