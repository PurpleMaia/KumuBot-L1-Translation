And the sweet potatoes were plentiful, Puali’i said with his hurried words, “There are two heads of ulua with sweet potatoes, and Puali’i ate, so then, freely, he and his wife, Pōka’ī, and others ate. Therefore, Puali'i went to Honouliuli to fish for food with the sweet potatoes.”",
  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_commentary": "• **Introduction:** The passage establishes a foundational scene within the narrative – the act of fishing and sharing sustenance. It immediately introduces key elements: Nāmakaokapāo’o (the protagonist), the significance of sweet potatoes, Puali'i (a significant character with an apparent need to consume) and Pōka'ī (his wife). The passage is a brief snapshot that will be critical to understanding the dynamics of this new world.\n\n• **Nāmakaokapāo’o and the Sweet Potatoes:** The name *Nāmakaokapāo'o* itself carries immense weight.  The element *nā-maka* refers to the eyes, specifically those of the pāo'o (a mythical fish). This likely symbolizes vigilance, perception, or even prophecy—qualities associated with Nāmakaokapāo’o as a young, formidable individual. The act of him being connected to this specific patch of sweet potatoes immediately establishes his connection to this land and its resources. “Until this day” indicates that this patch is old and sacred in some way, possibly linked to an ancestral lineage or important historical event.\n\n• **Puali'i’s Hastened Speech:** Puali'i’s description – \"Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala\" (There are two heads of ulua with sweet potatoes) is significant. The use of the word *aia* suggests urgency and a potential need to quickly consume, perhaps driven by hunger or a desire to demonstrate his ability to provide. The reference to “two heads of ulua” is not merely literal; it’s likely symbolic. Ulua fish were often used as substitutes for human sacrifices during the ‘Ai Kapu era (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: \"This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available, probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* [to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.\").  The pairing of ulua and sweet potatoes suggests a complex relationship between sustenance, ritual, and the very concept of life and death. This highlights the transition from ‘Ai Kapu practice (where human sacrifice was customary) to a new way of providing for oneself - or at least an attempt to do so – that is presented here.\n\n• **Shared Consumption:** The fact that Puali'i shares his catch with his wife, Pōka’ī, and \"others\" establishes a pattern of communal sharing—a common practice in Hawaiian society, rooted in the concept of *‘āina* (land) and its bounty. Sharing was considered a vital expression of social harmony and reciprocity. The use of \"others” suggests a broader network of individuals connected to Puali'i and his fishing activities.\n\n• **Honouliuli – A Place of Fishing:**  The location, Honouliuli (\"dark bay\"), is important. It indicates that this area is a significant fishing spot, perhaps one with long-standing cultural significance or a particularly abundant supply of fish. Its name suggests a place of potential danger or hidden depths - further reinforcing the themes of vigilance and survival present in the narrative.\n\n• **Allegorical Interpretation:** The passage as a whole can be viewed allegorically.  The abundance of sweet potatoes, Puali’i's haste to consume them, and the reference to ulua represent a transition away from traditional 'Ai Kapu practices towards a more secular approach to sustenance and resource management. The focus on sharing highlights the importance of community and interconnectedness in Hawaiian culture. The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o is associated with these sweet potatoes underscores his role as a powerful force shaping this new dynamic, even if he isn’t directly involved in the immediate action of fishing.  His presence serves as a reminder of the past and a symbol of the changing times.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
