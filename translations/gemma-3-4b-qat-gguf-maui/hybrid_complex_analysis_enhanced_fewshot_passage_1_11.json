  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "Okay, here’s my analysis of the passage, formatted as requested:\n\n<translation>Then he took his mother to Waipouli to build a house. His mother went down, returned, and they moved their house to Keahumoa and settled in. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed onto the roof of the house, opened up his back and face, and lay down on top of it.</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• **Paragraph 1 – Establishing Residence & Family Dynamics:** This paragraph establishes a key shift in the narrative: the family’s relocation. It introduces Waipouli (likely a specific location within Līhu'e) as the site for construction, highlighting the practical aspects of settling into a new environment—building a house. The movement to Keahumoa signifies a further journey and solidifies their presence in a particular area. • The action of Nāmakaokapāo’o climbing onto the roof immediately establishes him as an active participant in establishing his household and asserting his position within it.  His behavior is slightly unsettling, presenting a contrast with more conventional child behaviors – suggesting potential defiance or an early assertion of dominance. This behavior hints at traits that will be important to understand throughout his development; • The “opening up of his back and face” is particularly significant. It’s a symbolic gesture—likely representing the breaking down of old structures (the previous home) and preparing for a new one. The specific detail of opening his back and face suggests an openness to receive, but also a willingness to expose himself – a vulnerability. This could be interpreted as him asserting control within the family dynamic.  The placement on “top” of the kaupoku (roof beams) positions him as dominant—a position he will hold throughout his life.  This is typical of narratives concerning powerful chiefs in Hawaiian culture, where physical positioning reflects social standing.</commentary>\n",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
