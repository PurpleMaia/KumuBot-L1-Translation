  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_translation": "They were going about their lives when Puali‘i, a good man from inland in Līhu‘e, arrived to fish on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her closely, and really liked her. He said, “I would like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve given birth to a child, and my body is ruined.” Puali‘i said, “That doesn't matter, if you like me, let's sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed. And she went with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of Keahumoa to live.",
  "gemma-3-4b-qat-gguf-maui_commentary": "• **Introduction and Setting:** The passage immediately establishes a narrative setting - two individuals, Puali’i and Pōka'ī, engaged in their daily activities.  The geographic location is crucial; Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā) refers to the coastal plain inland from Hilo on Hawai‘i Island, and Honouliuli is a significant bay known for its fishing – an important economic activity and resource base during this period. This indicates that the story likely takes place in pre-contact or early contact times. The mention of Puali'i coming *from* Līhu’e suggests he’s visiting from another area, perhaps signifying travel, trade, or a temporary circumstance.\n\n• **Character Introductions:** We are introduced to two primary characters:\n    – **Puali‘i (male):** Described as ‘kanaka maika‘i’ – “a good man.” This immediately establishes a positive attribute and suggests he is likely a respectable member of the community, possibly a skilled craftsman or fisherman himself. The fact that he comes from inland also implies an established social structure in Līhu'e, perhaps differing slightly from Pōka'ī's immediate surroundings.\n    – **Pōka‘ī (female):** Her physical state is described as ‘ino‘ino’ – “ruined” or “damaged.”  This is a significant detail that warrants careful interpretation.  It’s unlikely to refer simply to her appearance; rather, it likely refers to the hardships of childbirth and motherhood in a society where women bore children without anesthesia or modern medical care. It suggests a burden placed upon her as a mother – a common theme in Hawaiian storytelling reflecting the realities of womanhood at that time. Her response is also important: she acknowledges Puali'i’s desire but immediately expresses hesitation, likely due to the perceived impact of motherhood on her attractiveness and desirability. This highlights the cultural value placed on youthful beauty and fertility.\n\n• **The Proposition & Response:** The core of the passage centers around Puali‘i’s proposition – “Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u” (“I would like you to be my woman”). This isn't a straightforward marriage proposal; it suggests a long-term partnership, akin to what we might consider a courtship or informal union. The Hawaiian term ‘wahine na’u’ (woman for me) implies an established relationship of mutual affection and commitment – not simply a casual encounter.\n\n• **Pōka‘ī’s Hesitation & Reassurance:** Pōka'ī responds with vulnerability, questioning how he could possibly want her given the hardships she has endured: “Pehea ‘oe e makemake ai ia‘u? Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino.” (How could you possibly want me? I've given birth to a child and my body is ruined). This reveals the societal pressures placed upon women – particularly mothers.  Her self-deprecation highlights the ideal of beauty being closely tied to youthfulness and fertility. Puali'i’s response (“He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua.”) – “That doesn’t matter, if you like me, let’s sleep together” – demonstrates a willingness to overlook her hardships and prioritize affection and mutual desire.  The phrase \"e moe kāua\" (let's sleep together) is an expression of intimacy that goes beyond mere physical attraction; it signifies a commitment to shared companionship and pleasure.\n\n• **Acceptance & Transition:** Pōka‘ī’s agreement (“‘Ae akula ‘o Pōka‘ī”) indicates her willingness to accept Puali‘i's proposal, despite her reservations. The final sentence (\"A ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘ī me kāna kāne me Puali‘i ā ke kula o Keahumoa, noho.\") – “And she went with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of Keahumoa to live,” signifies a significant shift in her life. It’s not a marriage per se, but a relocation and a beginning of a new chapter together. Keahumoa (heap of chickens) is likely a reference to the area being rich with chicken farming – a common feature of Hawaiian landscapes.\n\n• **Cultural Context & Significance:** This passage reflects several key elements of Hawaiian culture: the importance of family, community, resourcefulness, and the duality of beauty and hardship. The 'Ai Kapu system, though not explicitly mentioned here, would have influenced social interactions and relationships at the time.  The emphasis on honoring ancestors (implied by Puali'i’s origin from inland) is also evident. This story suggests an early relationship formed in response to circumstance and desire, a testament to the resilience of love within a demanding cultural environment. The narrative highlights how individuals navigate personal desires while respecting societal norms and expectations.  The potential for conflict (represented by Puli’i's threat against Nāmaka) hints at the tensions between tradition and change which may have been brewing in Hawaiian society during this period—a foreshadowing of the eventual disruption of the ‘Ai Kapu system.",

  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
