He waa ia. Kuku ia ke kapa a iako, hahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he iako? He iako. Lawaia ka ia a loaa he ama, hahahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he ama? He ama ia.”",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”",
  "QwQ-32B-exl2-6_5bpw-maui_translation": "Okay, let's tackle this translation. The user wants the Hawaiian text translated into English. First, I need to understand the Hawaiian phrases here. The text starts with \"Olelo mai na kanaka makua:” which I think means \"The parents said:\" or \"The elders said:\". Then there's a dialogue between a parent and a child.\n\nThe next part is “Keiki wahahee; pau no ka waa iloko o ka ipu, e laa me ka iako, ke ama?” I need to parse each word. \"Keiki wahahee\" might be \"child, chatterbox\" or \"talkative child\". \"Pau no ka waa iloko o ka ipu\" – \"the canoe is finished inside the calabash?\" Maybe \"the canoe is inside the calabash, now what?\" Then \"e laa me ka iako, ke ama?\" – \"get the iako and the ama?\" Iako are the outrigger supports, and ama is the outrigger float in a Hawaiian canoe.\n\nThe child responds: “Kuku ia ke kapa a kiwaawaa, hahao iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he waa? He waa ia. Kuku ia ke kapa a iako, hahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he iako? He iako. Lawaia ka ia a loaa he ama, hahahao ia ilоко o ka ipu, aole ia la he ama? He ama ia.”\n\nBreaking it down: \"Kuku ia ke kapa a kiwaawaa\" – maybe \"Stitch the cloth and the sides?\" \"Hahao iloko o ka ipu\" – \"placed inside the calabash?\" Then \"aole ia la he waa? He waa ia.\" – \"Is it not a canoe? It is a canoe.\" Similarly for the next parts about iako and ama. The child is using a riddle where each part of the canoe is being questioned, and the answer affirms each part despite being in the calabash. \n\nWait, the calabash is a metaphor here. The parent is probably challenging the child with a riddle. The calabash is small, so how can a canoe be inside? The child is explaining that each part (canoe, iako, ama) is made from the calabash's materials or in a way that fits. Maybe the calabash represents the materials used to build the canoe. So the parent is saying the canoe is inside the calabash, and the child is explaining each component's origin from the calabash. \n\nI need to make sure the translation captures the riddle and the playful back-and-forth. Also, terms like \"kapa\" is a type of bark cloth, but in the context of a canoe, maybe it refers to planks or parts. \"Kiwaawaa\" might be the sides of the canoe. \"Hahao\" could mean placed or positioned. \n\nPutting it all together, the parent is posing a riddle where the child has to figure out how each canoe part is made from the calabash. The child answers each part affirmatively, showing understanding. The translation should reflect that structure. Let me check each part again for accuracy. \n\n\"Keiki wahahee\" – \"Child, chatterbox\" or \"Talkative child\". Maybe \"Child, chatterbox\" is better as it's a term of endearment or teasing. \n\n\"Pau no ka waa iloko o ka ipu\" – \"The canoe is finished inside the calabash?\" Or \"The canoe is inside the calabash now?\" \n\n\"E laa me ka iako, ke ama?\" – \"Fetch the iako and the ama?\" \n\nThe child's response: Each line starts with making the part, placing it in the calabash, and the parent questioning if it's not the part, then the child affirms it is. \n\nSo the translation should flow as a dialogue where the parent asks the child to get parts of the canoe that are inside a calabash, and the child explains each part's construction from the calabash materials. \n\nI think that's the gist. Now, translating each part carefully, keeping the structure and the riddle's meaning intact. Let me write the translation now.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nThe parents said: \"Child, chatterbox; the canoe is inside the calabash, now fetch the iako and the ama!\" The child replied: \"Stitch the cloth and the sides, place them inside the calabash—is it not a canoe? It is a canoe. Stitch the cloth and the iako, place them inside the calabash—is it not an iako? It is an iako. Fish for the fish and find the ama, place it inside the calabash—is it not an ama? It is an ama.\"\n</translation>"
