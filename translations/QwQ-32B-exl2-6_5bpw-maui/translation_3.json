  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",
  "QwQ-32B-exl2-6_5bpw-maui_translation": "Okay, I need to translate this Hawaiian text into English. Let me start by reading through the original passage carefully to understand the context and the key elements. The text mentions names like Keawenuiaumi and Mainele, which are probably people or places. There's also reference to a canoe (koa waa) and some birds (manu). The phrase \"hokeo ie\" might be a term I need to look up or infer from context.\n\nFirst sentence: \"I ka lua o ka la o lakou ma Hilo, pii o Keawenuiaumi me Mainele i kahi o ke koa waa, a na manu e hea ai, me ka auamo ia o ka hokeo ie.\" \n\nBreaking it down: \"I ka lua o ka la o lakou ma Hilo\" – \"On the second day of their stay in Hilo\". \"Pii o Keawenuiaumi me Mainele i kahi o ke koa waa\" – Keawenuiaumi and Mainele climbed onto a part of the canoe. \"a na manu e hea ai\" – and the birds that would guide them? \"me ka auamo ia o ka hokeo ie.\" – with the support of the hokeo ie. Maybe \"hokeo ie\" is a type of bird or a specific term?\n\nNext part: \"A hiki pono lakou malalo o ke kumu o ua koa nei, noho kaawale aku la o Kauakahi me ka hokeo ie.\" \n\nHmm, \"hiki pono\" might mean arrived properly? \"malalo o ke kumu o ua koa nei\" – under the root or base of that tree? \"noho kaawale aku la o Kauakahi me ka hokeo ie.\" – Kauakahi separated from the hokeo ie? Not sure about \"kaawale aku\".\n\nThen: \"Ia wa, ooki na kalai waa a Keawenuiaumi i ke kumu o ke koa, kau ana na manu, kahea ana: “E, Keawenuiaumi e! Aohe waa, he puha. He waa ino, he waa puha. He waa hiki ole i ka moana.”\"\n\n\"Ia wa\" – at that time. \"ooki na kalai waa a Keawenuiaumi i ke kumu o ke koa\" – perhaps the canoe builders of Keawenuiaumi were at the base of the tree. \"kau ana na manu, kahea ana\" – placed the birds, called out. The quote says there's no canoe, it's a puha (maybe a term for a dugout?), a bad canoe, can't go to sea.\n\nI need to make sure the names are kept as is. \"Hokeo ie\" might be a specific term, maybe a type of bird or a tool. Since it's paired with \"manu\" (birds), perhaps it's a bird's name. Alternatively, \"hokeo\" could mean a decoy or something used to attract birds. \"Ie\" might be a type of cloth or a specific item. Maybe \"hokeo ie\" is a ceremonial item or a specific bird used in navigation?\n\nPutting it all together, the story seems to involve Keawenuiaumi and Mainele building or using a canoe, with birds guiding them. There's a conflict where Kauakahi separates from the hokeo ie, and then the canoe builders are criticized for making a bad canoe that can't sail. The birds then call out the warning.\n\nI should check if \"koa waa\" is a war canoe or just a canoe made from koa wood. Since \"koa\" is a type of wood, \"koa waa\" would be a canoe made from koa. \"Kumu o ke koa\" might refer to the base of the koa tree or the foundation of the canoe.\n\nTranslating step by step, ensuring names stay, and terms like \"hokeo ie\" are kept if unsure. Maybe \"hokeo\" is a type of bird, so \"hokeo ie\" could be a specific species. Alternatively, \"hokeo\" might mean a decoy, so \"hokeo ie\" could be a decoy made of ie (a type of bark cloth). But without more context, it's safer to transliterate.\n\nFinal translation should flow naturally in English while preserving the original elements. Let me try putting it all together now.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nOn the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele climbed onto a part of the koa canoe, accompanied by the birds that guided them, along with the support of the hokeo ie. They arrived beneath the base of that tree, and Kauakahi separated from the hokeo ie. At that time, the canoe builders of Keawenuiaumi gathered at the base of the tree, placed the birds, and called out: “O Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, only a dugout. A bad canoe, a mere dugout. A canoe that cannot sail the ocean.”</translation>"
