  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",
  "QwQ-32B-exl2-6_5bpw-maui_translation": "Okay, I need to translate this Hawaiian text into English. Let me start by reading through the original passage carefully to understand the context and the story being told. The text mentions Pumaia and a woman, so it's probably a traditional Hawaiian legend or a story involving spirits or ancestors.\n\nFirst sentence: \"I ka lua o ka po, hiki hou ka uhane o Pumaia i ka wahine.\" The phrase \"lua o ka po\" might mean \"depth of night\" or \"darkness of night.\" \"Uhane\" is spirit, so maybe \"the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman in the depth of night.\"\n\nNext: \"Eia nae ke kumu i hiki ai.\" \"Eia nae\" could be \"here is the reason\" or \"this is why.\" \"Kumu\" is root or cause, so \"this is the reason it happened.\"\n\nThen: \"Nana aku la ka makuahine i ke kaikamahine a pane aku:” The mother addressed her daughter and said... \"Nana aku la\" might be \"then the mother spoke to her daughter and said.\"\n\nThe quote: “U, o kaua ka hoi ka mea aloha o ka iwi koko, aole o ko makuakane o ka iwi koko ole.” This part is tricky. \"U\" is an interjection, maybe \"Ah.\" \"Ka hoi\" could be \"the return\" or \"the coming back.\" \"Mea aloha\" is beloved thing. \"Ka iwi koko\" – \"iwi\" is bone, \"koko\" is blood, so \"blood bone\" or \"bloodline.\" The daughter is saying something like, \"Ah, our return is the beloved one of the bloodline, not our father's of the non-bloodline.\" Maybe she's saying that their lineage is through the mother's side, not the father's?\n\nThen Pumaia responds: “Heaha ka olua e hamumu nei?” \"Why are you two arguing?\" \n\nThe woman replies: “Aole, e mea wale ae ana no maua i ka make, aole ou o ka iwi koko ole.” \"No, we are just talking, we are not the ones of the non-bloodline.\" Or maybe \"we are not of the non-bloodline, so we won't die.\" \n\nPumaia says: “E hele kakou; e wehe ia’u a lawe pu.” \"Let's go; let me be separated and taken along.\" \n\nThen the journey part: \"Pii aku la lakou mai Pukoula aku a ka uakee o Pauoa e hele la a hiki i ka wai o Alekoki, ma laila aku a Maemae, pela lakou i pii ai a owakawaka kai ao o ke kakahiaka nui, hiki lakou i Nuuanu.\" \n\nBreaking this down: \"Pukoula\" is a place name, maybe Pukoula. \"Uakee o Pauoa\" – \"uakee\" is a type of fern, so \"the fern of Pauoa.\" \"Wai o Alekoki\" is the water of Alekoki. \"Maemae\" could be another place or a name. \"Owakawaka\" might be a time of day, like dawn. \"Kai ao\" is morning mist. \"Kakahiaka nui\" is big morning, so early morning. \"Nuuanu\" is a place in Honolulu.\n\nPutting it all together, the story seems to involve Pumaia's spirit returning, a discussion about lineage, and a journey through specific places to Nuuanu at dawn.\n\nI need to make sure the translation flows naturally in English while preserving the original meaning. Some terms might be proper nouns (place names) that should stay as is. Also, the dialogue should reflect the characters' intentions clearly. Let me check each part again for accuracy and fluency.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nIn the depth of night, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. Here is the reason it happened. Then the mother addressed her daughter and said: “Ah, our lineage is the beloved bloodline, not our father’s non-bloodline.” Pumaia responded: “Why are you two arguing?” “No, we are merely speaking; we are not of the non-bloodline,” the woman replied. Pumaia then said to the woman: “Let us go; separate me and take me along.” They climbed down from Pukoula and proceeded toward the fern grove of Pauoa, journeying until they reached the waters of Alekoki. From there, guided by Maemae, they climbed onward, emerging at dawn’s misty light, and arrived at Nuʻuanu.</translation>"
