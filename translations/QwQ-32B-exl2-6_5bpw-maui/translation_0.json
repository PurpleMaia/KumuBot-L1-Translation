  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo.",
  "QwQ-32B-exl2-6_5bpw-maui_translation": "Okay, let's tackle this translation. The user wants the Hawaiian text translated into English. First, I need to understand the Hawaiian sentences. Let me read through them again.\n\nThe first part says: \"Ma keia kaao ana, ua olelo ia ke kino o Kana, he kino loihi loa, a he kino nui a weliweli ke nana aku.\" \n\nHmm, \"kaao\" is a story or legend. So \"Ma keia kaao ana\" might mean \"In this story\" or \"In this legend.\" Then \"ua olelo ia ke kino o Kana\" – \"it is said of the body of Kana.\" \"He kino loihi loa\" – \"a very long body\" maybe? \"Loihi\" can mean extended or stretched. \"He kino nui a weliweli ke nana aku\" – \"a large and flexible body that he used.\" \n\nNext sentence: \"I kona hanai ia ana, ua panee kona kino i ka loihi, a ua panee no hoi kona hale o Halauoloolo; mai ke kuahiwi a kokoke i ke kai kona kino ka loihi, a pela iho la no ke ako ana o ka hale, o Halauoloolo.\"\n\nBreaking it down: \"I kona hanai ia ana\" – \"When he was being raised\" or \"During his upbringing.\" \"Ua panee kona kino i ka loihi\" – \"his body was stretched out in the loihi.\" \"Ua panee no hoi kona hale o Halauoloolo\" – \"His house, Halauoloolo, was also stretched.\" Then \"mai ke kuahiwi a kokoke i ke kai\" – \"from the mountain to the sea.\" \"Kona kino ka loihi\" – \"his body was extended.\" \"A pela iho la no ke ako ana o ka hale, o Halauoloolo.\" – \"And so it was for the building of the house, Halauoloolo.\"\n\nPutting it together, it's a story about Kana's body being stretched long, and his house Halauoloolo was stretched from mountain to sea. The house's construction followed the same way his body was extended. \n\nI need to make sure the terms are correctly translated. \"Loihi\" here probably refers to stretching or extending. \"Weliweli\" is flexible. \"Hanai ia ana\" might be more like \"during his upbringing\" or \"when he was raised.\" \"Pannee\" is stretched. \n\nWait, \"panee\" could mean to stretch or spread out. So the body was stretched out in the loihi (maybe a specific term here?), and the house was also stretched. The house's building followed the same method. \n\nI should check if \"loihi\" has another meaning. It's also the name of a volcano, but in context, since it's paired with \"loihi loa\" (very long), it's likely the verb form meaning to stretch. \n\nSo the translation would be something like:\n\n\"In this legend, it is said of the body of Kana, that it was a very long body, and a large and flexible body that he used. During his upbringing, his body was stretched out in the extension, and his house, Halauoloolo, was also stretched; from the mountain to the sea, his body was extended, and so it was for the building of the house, Halauoloolo.\"\n\nHmm, maybe \"extension\" isn't the best for \"loihi.\" Alternatively, \"stretched out in length\" or \"stretched out extensively.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"During his upbringing, his body was stretched out in the loihi, and his house Halauoloolo was also stretched; from the mountain down to the sea, his body was extended, and likewise for the construction of the house, Halauoloolo.\"\n\nI think \"loihi\" here is functioning as a noun meaning the act of stretching or extension. So \"stretched out in the extension\" might be okay, but maybe \"stretched out in length\" is clearer. \n\nAlso, \"nana aku\" – \"that he used\" or \"which he employed.\" \n\nI'll go with that and structure it smoothly in English, making sure the flow is natural. Let me put it all together now.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nIn this legend, it is said of the body of Kana that it was a very long body, and a large, flexible body that he utilized. During his upbringing, his body was stretched out in length, and his house, Halauoloolo, was also stretched; from the mountain down to the sea, his body extended, and so too was the construction of the house, Halauoloolo, formed in the same manner.\n</translation>"
