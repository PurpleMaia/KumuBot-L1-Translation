  "reference_translation": "This call and reply was repeated twice before the guards heard it, when they sat up and listened to the call and they understood the meaning conveyed by the owl in its call. At this one of the guards said to his companion: “Say, this must be Laukiamanuikahiki, the king’s own daughter.” The other replied: “No, this cannot be the one, for she was to come in a red canoe having red sails, red paddles, red men, a large canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men; these I understand are the things that should accompany her; this girl on the other hand is a poor girl for she has come without any of these things.” The two again listened to the conversation between the owl and girl. After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter. They arrived at the home of Makiioeoe after midnight and roused him up saying: “Say, you wake up.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “There is an owl right over the pig house where the girl is held who called out to the girl in the following way:",
  "QwQ-32B-exl2-6_5bpw-maui_translation": "Okay, I need to translate this Hawaiian text into English. Let me start by reading through the entire passage to get a sense of the context. It seems like a narrative involving some characters, possibly a chief named Laukiamanuikahiki and a pueo (owl). There's mention of a canoe and some colors like ula (red?), and different sizes of canoes and people. \n\nFirst, I'll go sentence by sentence. The first line: \"Elua hana ana peia, lohe na kiai, ala ae la hoolohe, a maopopo ia laua ka olelo a ka pueo.\" Breaking it down: \"Elua hana ana peia\" – maybe \"Two were working, perhaps?\" \"Lohe na kiai\" – the guardians heard? \"Ala ae la hoolohe\" – perhaps they became alert or started listening. \"Maopopo ia laua ka olelo a ka pueo\" – they realized the owl's words. \n\nNext sentence: \"I aku kekahi i kekahi: “E, o ke kaikamahine no paha keia a ke ’lii, o Laukiamanuikahiki.”\" So one says to another: \"Hmm, maybe this is the commoner's daughter and the chief, Laukiamanuikahiki.\" \n\nThen the response: \"I mai kekahi: “Aole ia; he waa ula kona, he pea ula, he hoe ula, he kanaka ula, he waa nui, he waa iki, he waa loa, he kanaka nui, he kanaka iki, oia kona ano ke hele mai, aole keia kaikamahine ilihune.”\" The other says it's not; his canoe is red, the sail red, the paddle red, the people red, big canoes, small canoes, long canoes, many people, small people, that's his way of coming, not this lowly girl. \n\nContinuing: \"Hoolohe hou laua nei, i ka olelo a ka pueo a me Laukiamanuikahiki. “E pii kaua e olelo i ke ’lii, malama o ke kaikamahine no keia.” Ae aku kekahi. “Ae.”\" They listen again to the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki's words. \"Let's go tell the chief to take care of the girl for this.\" One agrees, \"Yes.\"\n\nNext part: \"Hiki laua i mua o Makiioeoe ke ’lii, i ke aumoe, hoala aku la: “E ia nei, e ala ae oe.” “Heaha?” wahi a Makiioeoe. “He pueo, aia maluna pono o ka puoa i paa ai ke kaikamahine. Penei ka olelo a ka pueo, a maua i lohe aku i ke kahea iho i ke kaikamahine.”\" They approach Chief Makiioeoe, who is asleep, and wake him: \"Hey there, wake up.\" \"What?\" says Makiioeoe. \"An owl, it's perched on the post where the girl is tied. The owl's words were like this, and we heard the call directed at the girl.\"\n\nHmm, some terms might need checking. \"Kaikamahine\" is a girl, \"iluhune\" is a lowly or common person. \"Waa ula\" – red canoe? \"Ula\" can mean red or sacred, but in context, red makes sense here. \"Pueo\" is an owl, often a sacred bird in Hawaiian culture. \"Makiioeoe\" is the chief's name. \"Aumoe\" means asleep. \n\nI should ensure the names are kept as is. Also, the structure of the dialogue needs to be clear. The first part talks about two people hearing the owl's message, then discussing whether it's the chief's daughter or something else. The second part is their decision to inform the chief, and then they wake him up to tell him about the owl and the girl. \n\nI need to make sure the translation flows naturally in English while preserving the original meaning. Words like \"he waa nui, he waa iki, he waa loa\" – big canoes, small canoes, long canoes. \"Kanaka ula\" – red people? Maybe people dressed in red? Or perhaps \"ula\" here refers to a specific term. Alternatively, \"kanaka ula\" could be a title or a specific group. But given the context, maybe it's descriptive. \n\nAlso, \"he waa ula kona\" – his canoe is red. The repetition of \"ula\" might be emphasizing the color or a specific trait. The second person is arguing that it's not the commoner's daughter but the chief's entourage with all these red items and various canoes and people. \n\nIn the dialogue where they tell the chief, \"malama o ke kaikamahine no keia\" – take care of the girl for this reason. The chief is asleep, so they wake him up, and explain about the owl on the post where the girl is tied. \n\nI think that's the gist. Now, putting it all together in English, making sure the sentences are coherent and the names are correctly transliterated. Also, check for any possible mistranslations. For example, \"peia\" in the first sentence – maybe \"peia\" is a typo or an old form? Or perhaps \"peia\" is part of a phrase. Alternatively, \"hana ana\" is working, so \"Elua hana ana peia\" could be \"Two were working there\" or \"Two were engaged in that task.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"peia\" might be a reduplication or a particle. Maybe \"Elua hana ana peia\" is \"Two were working, perhaps?\" But the structure is a bit unclear. Alternatively, \"hana ana\" is past tense, so \"Two were working, the guardians heard...\" Maybe \"Elua hana ana\" (two were working), \"peia\" could be a particle like \"therefore\" or \"so,\" but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to translate it as \"Two were working, the guardians heard...\" and see if that makes sense in context. \n\nOverall, the main points are the dialogue between the two people discussing the owl's message, their conclusion about the chief's arrival, and informing the chief about the girl and the owl. I'll proceed with the translation accordingly, ensuring names and key terms are accurate.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nTwo were working, the guardians heard, and they became attentive, realizing the words of the owl. One said to another: “Hmm, perhaps this is the commoner’s daughter and the chief, Laukiamanuikahiki.” The other replied: “No, that’s not it; his canoe is red, its sail red, its paddle red, his people red, with large canoes, small canoes, long canoes, many people, small people—that is his manner of arrival. This is not the lowly girl.” They listened again to the owl’s words and Laukiamanuikahiki’s message. “Let us go and tell the chief to protect the girl for this reason.” One agreed, “Yes.”  \n\nThey approached Chief Makiioeoe, who was asleep, and woke him: “Hey there, wake up!” “What?” said Makiioeoe. “An owl—it is perched atop the post where the girl is bound. The owl’s words were like this, and we heard the call directed at the girl.”  \n</translation>"
