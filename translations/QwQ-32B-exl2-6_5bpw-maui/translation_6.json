  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",
  "QwQ-32B-exl2-6_5bpw-maui_translation": "Okay, let's tackle this Hawaiian to English translation. First, I need to understand the Hawaiian text provided. It seems to be a genealogical or historical account involving names like Makiioeoe, Hina, and Laukiamanuikahiki. The user wants this translated into English, so I'll start by breaking down each sentence.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"O Makiioeoe ka makuakane, o Hina ka makuahine (o Kuaihelani ko Makiioeoe aina, oia ke ’lii olaila, he wahine no kana e noho ana i Kuaihelani, hookahi keiki me ia wahine, o Kahikiula ka inoa).\" \n\nBreaking this down, \"O Makiioeoe ka makuakane\" translates to \"Makiioeoe is the father,\" and \"o Hina ka makuahine\" is \"Hina is the mother.\" The parentheses mention Kuaihelani as Makiioeoe's homeland, so \"Kuaihelani is Makiioeoe's homeland, he is the chief there, a woman lives with him in Kuaihelani, they have one child, named Kahikiula.\" \n\nNext sentence: \"No Kauai o Hina, ilaila kahi i loaa ai o Laukiamanuikahiki.\" Hina is from Kauai, and that's where Laukiamanuikahiki was obtained. Maybe \"Hina is from Kauai, there she obtained Laukiamanuikahiki.\"\n\nThen: \"Mai Kuaihelani ka Makiioeoe hele ana mai, a loaa o Hina i Kauai, moe laua; a liuliu, hapai o Hina.\" Makiioeoe comes from Kuaihelani to Kauai, meets Hina, they sleep together, and Hina becomes pregnant. \"Makiioeoe came from Kuaihelani to Kauai, where he found Hina; they slept together, and Hina became pregnant.\"\n\nContinuing: \"Ia wa, hoi o Makiioeoe i Kuaihelani, olelo aku ia Hina: “E, ke hoi nei au; e noho oe a i hanau he keiki kane, kapa oe i kuu inoa; a i hanau he kaikamahine, kapa oe i ka inoa o Laukiamanuikahiki. I hanai oe a i nui, a manao e hele ae e imi ia’u, eia na hoailona, he lei palaoa, he kupee, he ahuula, he waa nui, he waa iki, he kanaka nui, he kanaka iki, he waa ula, he pea ula, he ka ulaula, he aha ula, he kanaka ula.”\" \n\nHere, Makiioeoe returns to Kuaihelani and tells Hina: \"I am returning; if you give birth to a boy, name him after me; if a girl, name her Laukiamanuikahiki. Raise her, and when she grows up and wants to find me, here are the signs: a lei palaoa (a whale tooth necklace), a bracelet, a feather cloak, a large canoe, a small canoe, a tall person, a short person, a red canoe, a red bird, a red fishhook, a red cord, a red person.\"\n\nFinally: \"Hoi aku la o Makiioeoe i Kuaihelani, me ka olelo i na kiai i ke ano o ke kaikamahine, a me ke kanu i na mea a pau loa no Laukiamanuikahiki, na kiowai a me na mea e ae, kapu a noa ia Laukiamanuikahiki.\" \n\nMakiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani, informing the guardians about the girl's appearance and providing all things needed for Laukiamanuikahiki, including water and acceptable items, making her both sacred and ordinary.\n\nI need to ensure the names are kept as is, and the cultural terms like \"lei palaoa\" and \"ahuula\" are translated accurately. Also, the structure should flow naturally in English while preserving the original meaning. Let me piece this all together now.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nMakiioeoe is the father, Hina the mother (Kuaihelani is Makiioeoe’s homeland, he is the chief there, a woman lives with him in Kuaihelani, and with that woman they have one child, named Kahikiula). Hina is from Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was obtained. Makiioeoe came from Kuaihelani to Kauai, where he found Hina; they slept together, and Hina became pregnant. At that time, Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani, telling Hina: “I am going back. If you give birth to a boy, name him after me; if a girl, name her Laukiamanuikahiki. Raise her, and when she grows up and desires to seek me out, here are the signs: a whale-tooth necklace, a bracelet, a feather cloak, a large canoe, a small canoe, a tall person, a short person, a red canoe, a red bird, a red fishhook, a red cord, a red-clad person.” Makiioeoe then returned to Kuaihelani, informing the guardians of the girl’s appearance and providing all things needed for Laukiamanuikahiki—including water and acceptable items—making her both sacred and ordinary.  \n</translation>"
