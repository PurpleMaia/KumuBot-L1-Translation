  "reference_translation": "When Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui woke up in the morning and went out of doors, they saw a wooden dagger sticking in the ground just outside of the entrance. At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”",
  "QwQ-32B-exl2-6_5bpw-maui_translation": "Okay, let's tackle this Hawaiian to English translation. First, I need to understand the Hawaiian text provided. The user wants the translation wrapped in <translation> tags, so I'll make sure to do that at the end.\n\nStarting with the first sentence: \"O Kalelealuaka a me Keinohoomanawanui, i ko laua ala ana i ke kakahiaka a hele iwaho o ka hale, iko iho la laua he pahoa e ku ana ma ka puka o ka hale, ua kukuluia.\"\n\nHmm, \"O Kalelealuaka a me Keinohoomanawanui\" – these are names, so I'll keep them as is. The next part: \"i ko laua ala ana i ke kakahiaka a hele iwaho o ka hale\" – \"ala ana\" might mean they woke up? \"Ke kakahiaka\" is morning. So maybe \"as they awoke in the morning and went outside the house.\" \n\nThen \"iko iho la laua he pahoa e ku ana ma ka puka o ka hale, ua kukuluia.\" \"Iko iho\" could be \"they found\" or \"they discovered.\" \"He pahoa\" is a knife or sharp object. \"E ku ana\" is standing. \"Ma ka puka o ka hale\" at the doorway. \"Ua kukuluia\" perhaps erected or placed there. So putting it together: \"they found a knife standing at the doorway of their house, which had been placed there.\"\n\nNext sentence: \"I aku o Keinohoomanawanui ia Kalelealuaka: “Make kaua! Eia la he pahoa ma ka puka o ka hale o kaua! Ua loaa. Aloha ino kaua i ka make; o ka’u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe e waiho ke ’lii, aohe make olelo.”\"\n\n\"I aku\" is \"said.\" So Keinohoomanawanui is speaking to Kalelealuaka. The quote starts with \"Make kaua!\" which might be \"We are doomed!\" or \"Alas for us!\" \n\n\"Eia la he pahoa ma ka puka o ka hale o kaua!\" – \"Here is a knife at the doorway of our house!\" \n\n\"Ua loaa.\" – \"It has arrived\" or \"It's here.\" \n\n\"Aloha ino kaua i ka make\" – \"We love death\" or maybe \"We have a great love for death\"? That doesn't make sense. Maybe \"Aloha ino\" is \"extreme love\" but in context, perhaps \"We are greatly loved by death\" or \"Death loves us greatly.\" Alternatively, \"Aloha ino\" could be an expression of strong feeling. Maybe \"We are doomed to die!\" \n\n\"O ka’u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe e waiho ke ’lii, aohe make olelo.\" – \"It is I who will tell you to leave the chief, no death words.\" Wait, \"e waiho ke 'lii\" – \"to leave the chief\"? Maybe \"to spare the chief\"? \"Aohe make olelo\" – \"no death words\" or \"no words of death.\" Perhaps \"I will be the one to tell you to spare the chief, there will be no death words.\" Or maybe \"I will be the one to tell you to leave the chief, no more talk of death.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the dialogue seems like Keinohoomanawanui is reacting to the knife at the doorway, warning that death is near, and decides to take action regarding a chief, perhaps sparing him instead of confronting him.\n\nI need to ensure the names are correct and the context makes sense. Maybe \"aloah ino\" is \"extreme love\" but in this context, it's more likely an expression of being doomed. \"Make\" means death, so \"Aloha ino kaua i ka make\" could be \"We are greatly loved by death\" but that's awkward. Maybe \"We are doomed to die\" is better.\n\nThe last part: \"o ka’u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe e waiho ke ’lii, aohe make olelo.\" – \"It is I who will tell you to spare the chief, no more death talk.\" Or \"I will be the one to tell you to leave the chief, there will be no death words.\"\n\nI think that's the gist. Now, structuring the sentences properly in English while keeping the original meaning. Let me piece it all together now.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nKalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, as they awoke at dawn and went outside the house, found a knife standing at the doorway of their house, which had been placed there. Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “Alas for us! Here is a knife at the doorway of our house! It has arrived. We are doomed to die; I alone will tell you to spare the chief, no more talk of death.”  \n</translation>"
