  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession.",
  "QwQ-32B-exl2-6_5bpw-maui_translation": "Okay, let's tackle this Hawaiian to English translation. First, I need to make sure I understand the Hawaiian text properly. The user provided a passage that seems to be about genealogy or historical figures in Hawaii, mentioning places and names like Waiakea in Hilo, Halepaki, Wailea, and others. \n\nStarting with the first sentence: \"O Waiakea i Hilo ka aina, o Halepaki ka makuakane, o Wailea ka makuahine.\" Breaking it down, \"O Waiakea i Hilo\" probably means \"Waiakea in Hilo is the land.\" Then \"ka aina\" is \"the land.\" Next, \"o Halepaki ka makuakane\" would be \"Halepaki is the father,\" and \"o Wailea ka makuahine\" translates to \"Wailea is the mother.\" So the first part is establishing the lineage: the land is Waiakea in Hilo, with Halepaki as father and Wailea as mother.\n\nMoving on: \"He kaikaina hoi ko Wailea, o Kalenaihaleauau, ka wahine a Kukuipahu, ke ’lii o Kohala.\" \"He kaikaina\" means \"a younger sister,\" so \"Ko Wailea\" is \"of Wailea,\" so \"Kalenaihaleauau is the younger sister of Wailea.\" Then \"ka wahine a Kukuipahu\" would be \"the wife of Kukuipahu,\" and \"ke ’lii o Kohala\" is \"the chief of Kohala.\" So Kalenaihaleauau is the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala, and the younger sister of Wailea.\n\nNext sentence: \"Hanau o Kaipalaoa a nui, hele kona makuakane a Kauai, make ia Kalanialiiloa, he ’lii kapu no Kauai, he ’lii akamai i ka hoopapa, nana ua pa iwi nei o kanaka, o Halepaiwi, he wahi iki koe puni loa ua pa nei i ka iwi kanaka.\" This is a bit more complex. \"Hanau o Kaipalaoa a nui\" – \"Born was Kaipalaoa, the great one.\" Then \"hele kona makuakane a Kauai\" – \"his father went to Kauai.\" \"Make ia Kalanialiiloa\" – \"Kalanialiiloa died.\" \"He ’lii kapu no Kauai\" – \"he was a sacred chief of Kauai.\" \"He ’lii akamai i ka hoopapa\" – \"a clever chief in the hoopapa (maybe a ritual or ceremony?)\" \"Nana ua pa iwi nei o kanaka\" – \"he was the one who broke the bones of people.\" \"O Halepaiwi\" – \"Halepaiwi (a place or name?)\" \"He wahi iki koe puni loa ua pa nei i ka iwi kanaka.\" – \"It is a small place that completely surrounds the breaking of human bones.\" Hmm, maybe \"Halepaiwi is a place where many people's bones were broken.\" Not entirely sure about \"hoopapa\" here. Maybe \"hoopapa\" refers to a structure or a ritual? Alternatively, \"hoopapa\" could be a typo or an old term. Alternatively, \"pa iwi\" is \"break bones,\" so maybe the chief was known for breaking bones, and Halepaiwi is a place associated with that.\n\nContinuing: \"Ua ike no o Halepaki i ka hoopapa, ua ao ia no, aole nae i ailolo, holo e i Kauai a make ai ia Kalanialiiloa.\" \"Halepaki saw the hoopapa, he knew, but was not afraid, ran to Kauai and killed Kalanialiiloa.\" So Halepaki, the father, upon seeing the hoopapa (whatever that is), realized something, wasn't afraid, went to Kauai and killed Kalanialiiloa.\n\nLast part: \"O Pueonuiokona ke ’lii o Kauai.\" \"Pueonuiokona is the chief of Kauai.\"\n\nNow, putting it all together, making sure the flow makes sense. The names and places are important. Need to check if any terms have specific meanings. For example, \"kapu\" means sacred, \"lii\" is chief. \"Hoopapa\" might be a term needing context. Since it's about a chief breaking bones, maybe \"hoopapa\" is a structure or a ritual where bones were broken? Alternatively, \"hoopapa\" could be a misspelling or an old term. Maybe \"hoopapa\" is a type of punishment or a place? Alternatively, \"hoopapa\" could mean \"foundation\" or \"structure,\" but in this context, perhaps it's a ritual or a practice. Since the chief is described as \"akamai i ka hoopapa\" (clever in the hoopapa), maybe it's a skill or a role he had. \n\nAlso, \"pa iwi\" is definitely \"break bones,\" so the chief was known for breaking people's bones, and Halepaiwi is a place where that happened. The phrase \"he wahi iki koe puni loa ua pa nei i ka iwi kanaka\" might mean \"a small place that completely surrounds the breaking of human bones,\" but maybe more naturally \"a place where many people's bones were broken.\" \n\nHalepaki, upon seeing the hoopapa (maybe the bones or the place), realized the danger, wasn't afraid, went to Kauai and killed Kalanialiiloa. Then Pueonuiokona is the chief of Kauai now.\n\nI need to ensure the translation flows smoothly while keeping the names and terms accurate. Also, check for any possible mistranslations. For example, \"he kaikaina hoi ko Wailea\" – \"a younger sister of Wailea,\" so Kalenaihaleauau is the younger sister. \"Ka wahine a Kukuipahu\" – \"the wife of Kukuipahu,\" so she's married to the chief of Kohala. \n\nThe part about Kaipalaoa being born, the father went to Kauai, then Kalanialiiloa died. Maybe the father (of Kaipalaoa?) went to Kauai, leading to Kalanialiiloa's death? Or perhaps the father is the one who went, and then Kalanialiiloa died. The structure here is a bit unclear. \"Hanau o Kaipalaoa a nui, hele kona makuakane a Kauai, make ia Kalanialiiloa...\" So \"Born was Kaipalaoa the great, his father went to Kauai, and Kalanialiiloa died...\" Maybe the father's journey to Kauai resulted in Kalanialiiloa's death? Or perhaps the father is the one who killed him? The next part says Kalanialiiloa was a sacred chief of Kauai, clever in hoopapa, the one who broke bones, etc. So perhaps the father went to Kauai to confront him, leading to his death. \n\nPutting it all together, the translation should capture the genealogical relationships and the narrative of the chiefs and their actions. Ensuring that names are kept as is, and terms like \"kapu\" and \"lii\" are translated appropriately. The tricky part is \"hoopapa\" and the structure of the sentences. Maybe \"hoopapa\" here refers to a ritual or a practice that the chief was skilled in, which involved breaking bones. Alternatively, \"hoopapa\" could be a typo for \"hoopaa\" (to fix, place), but not sure. Since the user wrote \"hoopapa,\" I'll stick with that unless it's a known term. \n\nFinal check: The user wants the translation in <translation> tags. Make sure all parts are included and the flow is logical. Also, check for any possible errors in parsing the sentences. For example, \"he wahi iki koe puni loa ua pa nei i ka iwi kanaka\" – \"a small place that completely surrounds the breaking of human bones\" might be better as \"a small place where many people's bones were broken\" or \"a place renowned for the breaking of human bones.\" \n\nAlright, time to put it all into English with the tags.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nThe land is Waiakea in Hilo, Halepaki is the father, Wailea is the mother. Kalenaihaleauau is the younger sister of Wailea, the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala. Born was Kaipalaoa the great; his father went to Kauai, and Kalanialiiloa died. He was a sacred chief of Kauai, a clever chief in the hoopapa, the one who broke the bones of people, Halepaiwi—a place where many human bones were shattered. Halepaki saw the hoopapa, understood it, yet was not afraid; he rushed to Kauai and killed Kalanialiiloa. Pueonuiokona is the chief of Kauai.  \n</translation>"
