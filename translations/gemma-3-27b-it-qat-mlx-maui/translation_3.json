  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",
  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_translation": "Here's a translation of the Hawaiian text to English:\n\n<translation>On the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele ascended to the place of the canoe warrior (likely a heiau or sacred site associated with canoes and warfare), where birds were calling, accompanied by the carrying of the ie (barkcloth) bundle. They arrived properly beneath the base of that warrior canoe, and Kauakahi separated himself with the ie bundle. At that time, Keawenuiaumi’s canoe builders began work on the base of the canoe, placing [something - possibly offerings] and calling out: “Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe [suitable], it is flawed. It is a bad canoe, a flawed canoe. A canoe that cannot go to sea.”</translation>\n\n**Notes on the translation and potential interpretations:**\n\n*   **\"koa waa\"**: This is interpreted as a \"canoe warrior,\" but it could also refer to a sacred site *dedicated* to canoe warfare or a particularly significant canoe itself. The context suggests something more than just the physical object.\n*   **\"auamo ia o ka hokeo ie\"**:  This refers to carrying a bundle of *ie* barkcloth. This likely represents offerings or something important for the ritual/work being done.\n*   **\"Kauakahi kaawale aku la\"**: Kauakahi separates himself. This suggests a ritual separation or perhaps he is dissenting from the work being done on the canoe.\n*   **\"kalai waa\"**: Canoe builders.\n*   **\"puha\"**: Flawed, broken, or not good. This is a key element indicating the canoe is deemed unsuitable for sailing.\n*   The repeated warnings about the canoe being \"puha\" and unable to go to sea suggest a prophecy or omen regarding its failure.\n\n\n\n"
