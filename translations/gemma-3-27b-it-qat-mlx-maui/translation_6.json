  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",

From Kauai of Hina came Laukiamanuikahiki. From Kuaihelani, Makiioeoe departed, and Hina obtained Kauai, they lay together; and afterwards, Hina became pregnant. At that time, Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani, and said to Hina: “I am returning; you remain until a son is born, name him after me; and if a daughter is born, name her after Laukiamanuikahiki. Raise [the child] until they are grown, and when they desire to come seek me, here are the signs: a lei of seeds, a kupee [a type of adornment], an ahuula [feather cloak], a large canoe, a small canoe, a tall person, a short person, a red canoe, a red pea, a red ‘ie‘ie vine [used for lei making], a red aha [another type of vine used for lei making], a red person.” Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani, with instructions to the guardians regarding the nature of the daughter, and preparations for everything pertaining to Laukiamanuikahiki – provisions and all necessities, sacred and common things for Laukiamanuikahiki.</translation>"
