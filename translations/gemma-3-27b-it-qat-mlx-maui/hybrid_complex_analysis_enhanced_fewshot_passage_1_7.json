All the children saw this and ran to stand far away out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Behold! The knife is in my hand, it’s a thing to cut off your head today, and your head will be severed, then cooked with the sweet potato, and I will eat it first, and then it will be free (noa).” Nāmakaokapāo‘o didn’t listen to these words of Puali‘i, and then Puali‘i spoke again – it was the second time. Puali‘i prepared to cut Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the knife, at which time Nāmakaokapāo‘o recited his death chant for Puali‘i.

  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• This paragraph marks a critical escalation in the conflict between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, culminating in a direct threat of violence and Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s counter-offensive through the recitation of a death chant (oli make). The imagery is stark and symbolic, deeply rooted in Hawaiian cosmology and social practices. – Puali‘i’s possession of the ko‘ilipi (knife) is not merely a physical act but represents his assertion of power and intent to break the kapu (sacred law) by taking a life. The repetition of “eia” (“behold!”) emphasizes the gravity of the situation and serves as a warning. The children’s reaction – fleeing in fear – highlights the perceived danger of Puali‘i and his disregard for traditional protocols.\n\n• The name Nāmakaokapāo‘o continues to be significant. – Nā-maka (eyes) references sight, perception, and knowledge; - o-ka (of the); - pāo‘o (pāo‘o fish). The pāo‘o fish is a deep-sea fish known for its large eyes and association with darkness, suggesting Nāmakaokapāo‘o possesses hidden knowledge or foresight. The name itself is a declaration of his identity and potentially a source of his power.\n\n• Puali‘i’s threat to “cook” and “eat” Nāmakaokapāo‘o's head is a deeply disturbing act that echoes the practices of the 'Ai Kapu era. – In ancient Hawai'i, human sacrifice (kanu) was sometimes practiced to ensure fertility, success in warfare, or appease the gods. The head (po‘o) was considered a sacred part of the body, containing mana (spiritual power). The act of eating it would symbolically absorb that power. However, Puali‘i’s intent is not necessarily religious; it appears to be an act of revenge and dominance. The phrase “noa” (free, released) suggests a desire to break the kapu associated with death and consumption.\n\n• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s response – reciting his oli make – is a powerful act of defiance and counter-magic. The chant itself reveals crucial information about his lineage, identity, and worldview. – “Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o” (Beloved is the eye of my pāo‘o) reaffirms his connection to his namesake and source of power. “Hapupu‘u” is a term referencing the mouth, suggesting an invocation to consume or absorb power. The repeated phrase “E waiho paha” (Leave perhaps) is a plea for release or mercy, but also a subtle attempt to weaken Puali‘i’s resolve.\n\n• The name Nākukui‘aimakaokalani is particularly revealing. – Nā-kuku-i (descendant of a chief/chiefly line); - ai (to eat/consume); - maka-o-ka-lani (eyes of the heavens). This name suggests a lineage connected to high chiefs and divine knowledge. The invocation of Nākukui‘aimakaokalani could be a plea to ancestors for protection or intervention. The reference to “ku‘u wahi aikāne” (that one is my beloved companion) suggests a close relationship, possibly romantic or familial.\n\n• The final lines – “O Nāmakaokai‘a ke ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i” (Nāmakaokai‘a the high chief of Hawai‘i) – are a declaration of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s own high status. The reference to “ihe” (spear) and “pahu” (shield) signifies his warrior prowess. The repetition of “Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (Die indeed Nāmakaokapāo‘o) is a final curse, but also a subtle attempt to reverse the spell and inflict death upon Puali‘i.\n\n• Allegorically, this paragraph represents a clash between traditional 'Ai Kapu practices and emerging progressive thinking. Puali‘i embodies the old ways – a willingness to resort to violence, disregard for kapu, and belief in human sacrifice. Nāmakaokapāo‘o represents a new generation – one that values lineage, knowledge, and defiance of oppressive systems. The oli make is a powerful weapon – not necessarily to inflict physical harm, but to challenge Puali‘i’s worldview and ultimately dismantle the old order. The entire scene can be interpreted as a symbolic struggle for the future of Hawai'i, with Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing a path towards liberation and self-determination.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
