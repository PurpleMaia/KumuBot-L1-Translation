He waa ia. Kuku ia ke kapa a iako, hahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he iako? He iako. Lawaia ka ia a loaa he ama, hahahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he ama? He ama ia.”",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”",
  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_translation": "Here's the translation of the Hawaiian text to English:\n\n<translation>The elders said: “A mischievous child; the canoe is finished within the bowl, will it fit with the paddle, the ama (outrigger)? ” The child replied: “If you tear the tapa cloth and it’s frayed, is it not a canoe? It *is* a canoe. If you tear the tapa cloth and it’s frayed, is it not an outrigger paddle? It *is* an outrigger paddle. The fisherman catches an ama (outrigger), tears it and puts it in the bowl, is it not an outrigger? It *is* an outrigger.”</translation>\n\n**Explanation of nuances and context:**\n\nThis is a traditional Hawaiian riddle or *ʻōlelo noʻeau* (wise saying). It's a play on words and demonstrates the power of perspective. The elders are trying to trick the child with seemingly illogical questions about things being defined by their function even when damaged or altered. The child cleverly points out that something *is* what it is, regardless of its condition.  The use of \"kapa\" (tapa cloth) and the tearing/fraying is a key element – it's about redefining something based on its essential nature, not its physical state. The repetition emphasizes the child's point.\n"
