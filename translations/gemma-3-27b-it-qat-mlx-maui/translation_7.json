  "reference_translation": "The land of many hau trees is Kohala,\n\nI have counted [out of] one hau tree,\n\nAnd have found seven hau.\n\nThe hau for the outrigger makes one,\n\nThe hau for the iako makes two,\n\nThe bark of the hau makes three,\n\nThe wood of the hau makes four,\n\nThe bush of the hau makes five,\n\nThe large hau tree makes six,\n\nThe hau on the mountain makes seven.",
  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_translation": "Here's the translation of the Hawaiian text:\n\n<translation>A sandy beach of Kohala,\n\nI counted one hau tree,\n\nAnd seven more hau trees.\n\nOf the runner-hau (perhaps referring to a specific type or growth pattern) one, \nOf the climbing-hau two,\nOf the prickly-hau three,\nOf the wood-hau four, \nOf the belly-hau five,\nOf the fruit-hau six,\nOf the mountain-hau seven. </translation>\n\n**Notes on Translation & Context:**\n\n*   **Hau:** This refers to the hau tree ( *Hibiscus tiliaceus*). It's a very common coastal tree in Hawaiʻi.\n*   **Kinikini:** This word means sandy, or a sandy beach.\n*   The phrases \"keu,\" \"la akahi,\" etc., are ways of numbering or specifying different types/characteristics of the hau tree. They don't translate directly as \"first,\" \"second,\" etc., but rather indicate a sequence or categorization. The \"la\" seems to be an indicator of the number, and the following word describes a characteristic.\n*   The phrases like \"ke ama hau la akahi\" are poetic and likely refer to different forms or uses of the hau tree. It's difficult to give a precise translation without more cultural context, but they suggest different aspects of the tree (runner type, climbing habit, prickly leaves, wood use, fruit bearing, growth on mountains).\n*   The poem is essentially a counting song or description of different hau trees found in Kohala. It's likely used to identify and categorize the various forms of this important tree.\n\n\n\n"
