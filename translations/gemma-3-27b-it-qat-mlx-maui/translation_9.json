  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession.",
  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_translation": "Here's a translation of the Hawaiian text to English:\n\n<translation>From Waiakea in Hilo is the land, Halepaki is the father, Wailea is the mother. Wailea also has a brother, Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala. Kaipalaoa was born and grew large; his father went to Kauai, where Kalanialiiloa died, a sacred chief of Kauai, a wise chief in bone-setting (massage/healing arts). He is the one who sets the bones of people, Halepaiwi, a small area completely surrounding the bone-setting place. Halepaki also knew about bone-setting, he was taught it, but didn't fully grasp it. He went to Kauai and Kalanialiiloa died there. Pueonuiokona is the chief of Kauai.</translation>\n"
