At that time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief from O‘ahu, residing in Waikīkī. A man arrived from Honouliuli and came to Waikīkī, where the chief was staying. He said: “O Chief! There is a very strong little boy, his father died and his head was thrown into the sea – a very long distance, five miles long. And ‘Ama‘u heard this, and he has his strength and will die to him unless he has any strength.” And as he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o heard these words about him.",
  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The narrative structure continues to focus on the introduction of characters, descriptions of their status and location, and dialogue that reveals key information about the plot. The mention of distance (five miles) is noteworthy, likely holding symbolic weight beyond its literal meaning.\n\n– **Pua-li'i’s Death:** The abruptness of Pua-li'i’s death is striking. It serves as a catalyst for Nāmakaokapāo'o’s return to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and a period of mourning or perhaps inaction (indicated by Nāmakaokapāo'o’s refusal to eat). This could represent a symbolic death of the old ways, as Pua-li'i was seemingly intent on upholding traditional practices (as evidenced by his threat to eat Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o).\n\n– **Nāmakaokapāo’o and Pōka‘ī:** The mother-son pairing is re-established, but the lack of food consumption by Nāmakaokapāo'o suggests a period of spiritual or emotional turmoil. This could be interpreted as a rejection of the sustenance provided by Pua-li'i’s worldview.\n\n– **‘Ama‘u and the Narrative Shift:** The introduction of ‘Ama‘u, a chief from O‘ahu (the gathering place), signals a potential power struggle. The description of him as residing in Waikīkī (a historically significant location) reinforces his status. The dialogue about the “strong little boy” is crucial, as it establishes Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o as a figure of interest and potential threat.\n\n– **The “Strong Little Boy” & Allegorical Interpretation:** The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o as “strong” is repeated, emphasizing his physical prowess but also hinting at a deeper strength – perhaps resilience or spiritual power. The detail about his father’s head being thrown into the sea (five miles long) is highly symbolic. In Hawaiian cosmology, the ocean represents the realm of the gods and ancestors. Throwing a head into the sea could represent a severing of lineage or a rejection of ancestral traditions. The five-mile distance might allude to the five major Hawaiian islands (Hawai'i, Maui, O‘ahu, Kaua‘i, Moloka‘i/Lāna‘i) or the five fingers of the hand (representing mana).\n\n– **The Threat & ‘Ai Kapu Context:** The statement that ‘Ama‘u will die to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o unless he has strength suggests a potential conflict rooted in power dynamics. This could be interpreted as an allegory for the clash between traditional ‘Ai Kapu practices and a more progressive worldview. The ‘Ai Kapu era was characterized by strict social hierarchies, ritualistic practices (including human sacrifice), and a belief in mana as the source of power. ‘Ama‘u’s statement could represent the fear that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o possesses a greater mana or represents a threat to the established order. The narrative is building towards a confrontation that could symbolize the dismantling of the ‘Ai Kapu system or the emergence of a new era. The fact that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is listening to these words suggests he is aware of the threat and preparing for a challenge. The narrative structure continues to build suspense, foreshadowing a potential conflict that could have significant implications for the future of Hawaiian society. </commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
