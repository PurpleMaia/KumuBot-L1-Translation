  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Then, he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. And when his mother was gone, he returned to their house at Keahumoa and sat there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the rafters of the house, opened the covering of the back and front (of the house), and lay down in between on top of the rafters.</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 11:**• This paragraph marks a significant shift in the narrative, with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o taking decisive action following his mother’s disappearance (or intentional hiding). The act of concealment and subsequent positioning within the house structure are laden with symbolic meaning, likely relating to ancestral protection and a disruption of normal domestic order.\n\n– **Waipouli:** This place name is interesting, and likely holds esoteric meaning. *Wai* (water) often represents life force or the realm of the ancestors, while *Pouli* could relate to darkness or concealment. The cave itself represents a womb-like space, suggesting a return to origins or a place of hidden power. The act of hiding his mother *in* Waipouli, rather than simply *at* Waipouli, is significant. It suggests a deliberate attempt to protect her within the ancestral realm.\n\n– **The House Structure:** The house (*hale*) in Hawaiian culture is far more than just shelter. It represents the body, the lineage, and the connection to the gods (*akua*). The rafters (*kaupoku*) specifically represent the spine or backbone of the house, connecting the earthly realm to the heavens. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s positioning *on* the rafters, and specifically opening the covering of both the back (*kua*) and front (*alo*), is a deliberate act that disrupts the normal flow of energy within the house. \n\n– **Disruption of Domestic Order:** In traditional Hawaiian homes, there was a strict protocol for spatial arrangement and movement. The *kua* (back) of the house often faced inland, towards the mountains and ancestors, while the *alo* (front) faced the ocean. Opening both sides simultaneously suggests a breakdown of these boundaries, perhaps symbolizing Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s rejection of traditional norms or a desire to connect with both the ancestral and external realms. This could also be interpreted as an attempt to create a new space, free from the constraints of the past.\n\n– **Allegorical Interpretation:** Considering the context of previous paragraphs, where Pua-li'i threatened to eat Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo’o, this act of hiding and positioning on the rafters can be interpreted as a form of self-protection. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo’o is essentially retreating into the structure of his lineage (the rafters) and creating a barrier between himself and potential harm. The opening of the back and front could also symbolize his willingness to confront whatever challenges may come, rather than hiding in darkness. \n\n– **The 'Ai Kapu Era Connection:** While not explicitly stated, the narrative hints at a disruption of normal social order. The 'Ai Kapu era was characterized by strict protocols and hierarchies, with severe consequences for those who violated them. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s actions could be interpreted as a rejection of these constraints, perhaps foreshadowing a shift towards a more egalitarian society. The act of hiding his mother could also be seen as an attempt to protect her from the dangers of this era, where women were often vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. The disruption of the house structure could also be seen as a symbolic dismantling of the 'Ai Kapu system itself. The act of hiding in Waipouli, a place associated with the ancestors and life force, could also be seen as an attempt to reconnect with traditional Hawaiian values that were suppressed during the 'Ai Kapu era. </commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
