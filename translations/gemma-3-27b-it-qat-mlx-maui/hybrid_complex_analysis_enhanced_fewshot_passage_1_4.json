The name given to those patches was Nāmakaokapāo‘o, until this day. And as for the sweet potato, Puali‘i said with his promise, “The head of the ulua will be cooked with the sweet potato, and Puali‘i will eat, and then his wife, Pōka‘ī, and others will eat.” Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with the sweet potato.",
  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• This paragraph establishes the setting and reiterates Puali‘i’s intent, framing a potential conflict. The focus on the sweet potato patches and the promise of eating ulua with them is significant, hinting at deeper cultural meanings related to sustenance, ritual, and power dynamics. The repetition of “until this day” emphasizes the enduring nature of these practices or names, possibly suggesting a historical context.\n\n– The description of “two long sweet potato patches” is interesting. Numbers often carry symbolic weight in Hawaiian tradition, and two could represent duality or partnership. The length of the patches suggests abundance and sustained effort in cultivation. This contrasts with potential scarcity or hardship, setting up a narrative tension.\n\n– The naming of the patches after “Nāmakaokapāo‘o” is crucial. This likely isn’t a simple act of ownership; it suggests a connection between the child and the land, possibly even a spiritual or genealogical link. Let’s break down the name:\n    – *Nā-* (plural marker): Indicates more than one, or a collective association.\n    – *Maka-* (eye): As previously discussed in Chapter 1, this can represent vision, perception, or even the vine cutting used for replanting. It also alludes to the eyes of a person, as in Chapter 1.\n    – *-o-ka-* (of the): A possessive particle linking the previous elements.\n    – *Pāo‘o* (fish head): This is a direct reference to the fish head, but also carries metaphorical weight. *Pāo‘o* can symbolize leadership or intelligence (the head being the seat of thought). The name, therefore, could mean “The Eyes of the Leader” or “Vision of the Head,” linking Nāmakaokapāo‘o to both perception and authority.\n\n– Puali‘i’s promise is the central element of this paragraph. He explicitly states he will cook and eat the head of the *ulua* with sweet potato, then share it with his wife Pōka‘ī and “others.” This is a clear indication of his control over resources and his intention to provide for his family. However, the context is deeply rooted in Hawaiian cultural practices, specifically those surrounding *‘ai kapu* (sacred eating).\n\n– The reference to *ulua* is particularly significant. As previously noted, *ulua* held a special place in the ‘Ai Kapu era as a substitute for human sacrifice. The fish was believed to possess mana (spiritual power) and its consumption could transfer that power to the eater. The act of cooking and eating the *ulua* head, therefore, isn’t simply a meal; it's a ritualistic act with potentially profound implications.\n\n– The inclusion of “others” is ambiguous but important. It suggests a wider community or social structure beyond Puali‘i’s immediate family. This could represent his role as a provider or leader within that community, sharing the benefits of his resources and ritual power.\n\n– The location “Honouliuli” (dark bay) adds another layer of symbolism. Darkness often represents mystery, the unseen world, or even danger. This could foreshadow challenges or conflicts that Puali‘i will face while fishing for *ulua*. The act of going to a “dark bay” could represent a descent into the spiritual realm or a confrontation with unseen forces.\n\n– Allegorically, this paragraph represents a power struggle between traditional ‘Ai Kapu practices (Puali‘i’s promise) and potential shifts in societal norms. Puali‘i's insistence on consuming the *ulua* head could represent a clinging to old ways, while Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s connection to the land could symbolize a new generation challenging those traditions. The “others” represent the wider community caught in this conflict, potentially influencing the outcome. This paragraph sets the stage for a deeper exploration of these themes in subsequent chapters, hinting at a potential dismantling or reinterpretation of ‘Ai Kapu practices within the narrative.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
