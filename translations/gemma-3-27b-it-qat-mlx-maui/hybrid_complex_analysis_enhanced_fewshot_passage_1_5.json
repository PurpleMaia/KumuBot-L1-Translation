Nāmakaokapāo‘o's body at that time was very small, two feet and a half tall, he wasn’t strong, but rather slender. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, he told the children, “Tear out all the vines and leaves completely, don’t leave any to grow.” But the children were afraid, so they cautiously touched the sweet potatoes, not tearing out any vines.",
  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• This paragraph marks a significant shift in the narrative, with Puali‘i’s failure at fishing serving as a catalyst for Nāmakaokapāo‘o's actions. The introduction of seventeen children is noteworthy, suggesting a collective agency and potentially foreshadowing further events. The description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s diminutive stature is crucial, contrasting his physical weakness with the destructive command he issues. The children's fear and reluctance to obey highlight a moral tension within the scene.\n\n– **Puali‘i’s Failure:** The opening statement, “Puali‘i failed at fishing,” is deceptively simple. In traditional Hawaiian cosmology, success in resource acquisition (fishing being paramount) often reflects spiritual alignment and reciprocity with the natural world. Puali‘i’s failure could symbolize a disruption in this balance, perhaps due to his own actions or beliefs. This sets the stage for Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s intervention, which may be interpreted as an attempt to restore this balance or exploit the existing disruption.\n\n– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s Physicality:** The description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as “two feet and a half tall” is significant. This diminutive stature emphasizes his vulnerability but also potentially masks his cunning or influence. The qualifier “he wasn’t strong, but rather slender” further reinforces this contrast. This physical description is likely allegorical, representing a force that appears weak but possesses hidden power or agency. The name *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o* (the eyes of the pāo’o fish) is also relevant. – *Pāo'o* (pāo’o fish) often symbolizes a head or face, and *maka* (eyes) represent perception and knowledge. Thus, Nāmakaokapāo‘o could be interpreted as a figure who “sees” or understands something that others do not.\n\n– **The Seventeen Children:** The number seventeen is intriguing and likely holds symbolic weight. In traditional Hawaiian numerology, numbers often represent specific deities or concepts. While a definitive interpretation requires further research, seventeen could be associated with *Lono*, the god of agriculture and fertility. The children’s collective presence suggests a potential for growth or renewal, but their fear indicates that this potential is currently suppressed.\n\n– **The Command to Destroy:** Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s command, “Tear out all the vines and leaves completely, don’t leave any to grow,” is overtly destructive. This act directly contradicts the principles of sustainable agriculture and resource management that were central to traditional Hawaiian culture. The command could be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to undermine the existing system or exploit Puali‘i’s failure. This act is particularly resonant when considered in the context of the 'Ai Kapu era, where specific crops held ritual significance and were often subject to strict regulations. The destruction of the sweet potato patches could symbolize a rejection of these traditional practices or an attempt to usurp their power.\n\n– **The Children’s Fear:** The children's fear and reluctance to obey highlight a moral tension within the scene. Their hesitation suggests that they recognize the destructive nature of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s command and are unwilling to participate in it. This resistance could be interpreted as a symbol of hope or a foreshadowing of future conflict. The act of “cautiously touching” the sweet potatoes suggests a reverence for life and a reluctance to cause harm. This aligns with traditional Hawaiian values of *mālama* (caring for) and *aloha* (love and compassion).\n\n– **Allegorical Interpretation:** The entire scene can be interpreted as an allegory for the disruption of traditional Hawaiian culture and the rise of new forces. Puali‘i represents the old order, struggling to maintain his livelihood and spiritual alignment. Nāmakaokapāo‘o represents the new forces, exploiting the existing weaknesses and challenging the established norms. The seventeen children represent the potential for renewal, but their fear indicates that this potential is currently suppressed. The destruction of the sweet potato patches symbolizes the undermining of traditional practices and the rise of new ideologies. This interpretation is further strengthened by the context of historical events, such as the arrival of Western missionaries and the subsequent decline of traditional Hawaiian culture. The scene could be seen as a warning against the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of preserving traditional values.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
