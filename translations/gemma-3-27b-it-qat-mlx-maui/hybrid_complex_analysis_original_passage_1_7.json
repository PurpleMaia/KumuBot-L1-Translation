All the children knew [what was happening], and they ran and stood at a distance, fearing Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Behold! Here is the obsidian knife in my hand, it is a thing to cut off your head today, and your head will be severed, then baked with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat you first, and then it is finished.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not listen to these words of Puali‘i, and then Puali‘i spoke again – it was the second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut off Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head, just as Nāmakaokapāo‘o chanted her death chant for Puali‘i. Thus she chanted: “Beloved is the face of my sacred place, be filled, be sustained. Be eaten perhaps, or left perhaps, Perhaps left by Nākukui‘aimakaokalani. That is Nākukui‘aimakaokalani, This is my beloved companion, Nāmakaokai‘a the great chief of Hawai‘i. Drift away, drift away the uselessness. A person indeed with a spear, The spear indeed with its shield. Die now, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”",
  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_commentary": "This passage is a crucial segment from the story of Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a foundational myth explaining the origin of ‘uala (sweet potato) cultivation in Hawai'i. It’s a narrative rich with symbolism, power dynamics, and linguistic nuances reflecting ancient Hawaiian beliefs.\n\n**Cultural Context:**\n\n*   **Puali‘i as a Cultural Hero/Trickster:** Puali‘i is often portrayed as a demi-god or cultural hero. He's not necessarily benevolent; he uses cunning and sometimes violence to achieve his goals, often benefiting humanity. His actions are frequently transgressive – he steals from others (in this case, Nāmakaokapāo‘o) to bring valuable resources to the people. This aligns with a common motif in Polynesian mythology where heroes acquire knowledge or essential items through challenging or even deceitful means.\n*   **Nāmakaokapāo‘o and the Importance of ‘Uala:** Nāmakaokapāo‘o represents a guardian figure, fiercely protective of the ‘uala. The story emphasizes that she *owns* the knowledge and cultivation of this vital food source. ‘Uala was (and still is) a staple crop in Hawai'i, providing essential carbohydrates. The story explains why it became accessible to the common people – Puali‘i's theft and subsequent sharing. The intense protection of ‘uala highlights its importance to survival.\n*   **The Significance of the Obsidian Knife (Ko‘ilipi):** The ko‘ilipi isn’t just a tool; it's imbued with mana (spiritual power). Obsidian was used for tools and weapons, but also held symbolic importance. Its sharpness represents precision and the power to sever connections – both physical (like a head) and metaphorical (the connection Nāmakaokapāo‘o has to the ‘uala). The repeated emphasis on the ko‘ilipi underscores Puali‘i’s intent and the gravity of his threat.\n*   **Death Chant (Pule Make):** Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s chant is a powerful act of defiance and an attempt to reverse the situation.  It's not simply begging for her life; it’s invoking ancestral power and attempting to shift the outcome through spiritual means. The chant's structure is characteristic of Hawaiian oral tradition – repetitive phrases and invocations to deities or ancestors. The references to Nākukui‘aimakaokalani are key (see Linguistic Features below).\n*   **Power Dynamics & Gender Roles:** The story presents a clear power struggle. Puali‘i actively takes from Nāmakaokapāo‘o, demonstrating his dominance. While Nāmakaokapāo‘o defends her possession fiercely, she ultimately appears powerless against Puali‘i’s cunning and the threat of violence. The story can be interpreted as a commentary on shifting power structures or the acquisition of knowledge from female custodians.\n\n**Linguistic Features:**\n\n*   **Verb Structure & Imperative Mood:** The passage is filled with active verbs (\"holo akula\" - went, \"‘ōlelo akula\" – spoke) and imperative commands (\"Ē\\!\"). This creates a sense of urgency and action. The use of \"akula\" indicates reported speech, common in Hawaiian narratives.\n*   **Repetition & Parallelism:** The repetition of phrases (\"‘ōlelo akula,\" the description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s actions) is a hallmark of Hawaiian oral tradition. It aids memorization and emphasizes key points. The parallel structure in the chant (\"E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei,\" \"E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha\") is also significant.\n*   **‘Au (Sweet Potato) as a Central Motif:** The repeated mention of ‘au underscores its importance.  The act of baking the sweet potatoes is not just a culinary detail; it’s symbolic of Nāmakaokapāo‘o's control over the resource.\n*   **Names & Genealogy:** The name \"Nākukui‘aimakaokalani\" is crucial.  It's likely a genealogical connection, possibly an ancestor or related deity invoked for protection. The name itself is layered with meaning: \"Nā\" (the) + “Kukui” (candlenut tree, often associated with light and knowledge) + “‘Ai” (to eat/consume) + “Makaokalani” (eyes to the heavens). This suggests a connection to ancestral wisdom and divine sight.  The invocation of this name is Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s attempt to call upon powerful allies.\n*   **\"E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale\":** This phrase is somewhat enigmatic. \"He‘e\" means to drift or slide, and “hōhē” can mean uselessness or something insignificant. It’s a dismissal of Puali‘i, suggesting he is inconsequential and his threat will not materialize.\n*   **\"Ihe nō me ka pahu\":** This phrase refers to a spear and shield. It’s a declaration of strength and readiness for battle, but also potentially a symbolic representation of defense against Puali‘i’s aggression.\n\n**Historical Significance:**\n\n*   **Oral Tradition & Preservation of Knowledge:** This story, passed down through generations via oral tradition, demonstrates the importance of storytelling in preserving Hawaiian history, cultural values, and practical knowledge (like cultivation techniques).\n*   **Explaining Societal Shifts:** The story can be interpreted as a metaphorical representation of the introduction of new agricultural practices or resources to Hawai'i. Puali‘i’s actions could symbolize the disruption of existing power structures and the acquisition of knowledge from indigenous custodians.\n*   **Genealogical Connections & Ancestral Worship:** The invocation of names like Nākukui‘aimakaokalani highlights the importance of genealogy and ancestral worship in Hawaiian culture.  These connections were vital for establishing legitimacy and accessing spiritual power.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, this passage is a rich tapestry of Hawaiian mythology, cultural values, and linguistic nuances. It provides valuable insights into the beliefs, power dynamics, and historical context of ancient Hawai'i.  Analyzing it requires understanding not just the literal translation but also the deeper symbolic meanings and cultural context embedded within the language itself.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
