  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_translation": "While the two were living, Puali‘i, a good man from Līhu‘e, came down to fish off the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to Pōka‘ī’s house. Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and liked her, saying to her: “I want you as my wife.” Pōka‘ī replied: “How could you possibly want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is ruined.” Puali‘i said: “Those things don’t matter. If you like me, let us sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of Keahumoa to live.",
  "gemma-3-27b-it-qat-mlx-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• This paragraph introduces Pua-li‘i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line) as a potential mate for Pōka‘ī, setting the stage for a complex relationship dynamic. The narrative structure is straightforward, focusing on initial attraction and a surprisingly direct proposal. This simplicity belies deeper cultural implications regarding courtship, social status, and female agency within a pre-contact Hawaiian context.\n\n– **Character Introduction – Pua-li‘i:** The description of Pua-li‘i as a “good man” (*kanaka maikaʻi*) is significant. In Hawaiian tradition, *maikaʻi* extends beyond mere morality; it encompasses skillfulness, generosity, and adherence to social norms. His origin in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā) places him geographically and potentially socially within the island’s power structure. The act of fishing (*lawaiʻa*) at Honouliuli (dark bay) demonstrates his ability to provide sustenance, a crucial attribute for a prospective husband. The location of Honouliuli is also important; bays often held spiritual significance and were places where resources were plentiful, suggesting Pua-li‘i is connected to the land’s bounty.\n\n– **Courtship Rituals & Directness:** The proposal – “I want you as my wife” (*Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u*) – is remarkably direct. While modern interpretations might view this as aggressive, within the context of pre-contact Hawaiian society, such directness wasn’t necessarily uncommon. The emphasis was on practical considerations – the ability to provide and produce offspring – rather than elaborate courtship rituals. However, the lack of any preliminary gift-giving or reciprocal exchange suggests a power imbalance in this initial interaction.\n\n– **Pōka‘ī’s Hesitation & Self-Perception:** Pōka‘ī's response – “How could you possibly want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is ruined” (*Pehea ‘oe e makemake ai ia‘u? Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino*) – reveals deeply ingrained societal pressures surrounding female beauty and reproductive status. The phrase *ʻino‘ino ko‘u kino* (my body is ruined) speaks to the physical toll of childbirth and the potential stigma associated with a woman who has already borne children. This hesitation is crucial; it highlights the vulnerability of women within this social framework and their dependence on male acceptance.\n\n– **Pua-li‘i’s Dismissal of Concerns & Sexual Proposition:** Pua-li‘i's response – “Those things don’t matter. If you like me, let us sleep together” (*He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua*) – is striking in its pragmatism and disregard for Pōka‘ī’s concerns. The offer to simply “sleep together” (*e moe kāua*) bypasses traditional courtship protocols and focuses solely on physical intimacy. This suggests a transactional view of relationships, where Pōka‘ī’s worth is determined by her willingness to provide companionship and potentially further offspring. This aligns with the 'Ai Kapu era where procreation was paramount, but also reveals a potential lack of respect for Pōka‘ī’s emotional well-being.\n\n– **The Plains of Keahumoa & Relocation:** The couple’s relocation to the plains of Keahumoa (heap of chickens) signifies a shift in Pōka‘ī’s social and geographical position. The name Keahumoa itself is interesting; *kea* (white) often represents purity and new beginnings, while *humoa* (chicken heap) suggests a place of abundance and fertility. This could symbolize Pōka‘ī’s potential for renewal within her new relationship, but also a loss of independence as she moves to Pua-li‘i’s territory. The act of relocation itself is significant; it represents a transfer of power and control, with Pōka‘ī becoming dependent on Pua-li‘i for her livelihood and social standing.\n\n– **Allegorical Interpretation:** This paragraph can be interpreted allegorically as a representation of the clash between traditional Hawaiian values and emerging Western influences. Pua-li‘i represents a pragmatic, transactional approach to relationships, prioritizing physical needs and social status over emotional connection. Pōka‘ī represents the vulnerability of Hawaiian women within this changing landscape, struggling to maintain their dignity and agency in the face of external pressures. The relocation to Keahumoa symbolizes the assimilation of Hawaiian culture into a new, Western-dominated order. The directness and lack of ceremony in their relationship foreshadows the erosion of traditional Hawaiian customs and values.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
