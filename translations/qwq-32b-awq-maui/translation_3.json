  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",

They arrived safely beneath the base of that koa canoe, and Kauakahi remained there with the guidance of the ie. At that time, Keawenuiaumi's canoe builders approached the base of the koa canoe. The birds positioned themselves and called out: \"E, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe; it is a bubble. A bad canoe, a bubble canoe. A canoe that cannot reach the ocean.\"\n</translation>"
