  "reference_translation": "This call and reply was repeated twice before the guards heard it, when they sat up and listened to the call and they understood the meaning conveyed by the owl in its call. At this one of the guards said to his companion: “Say, this must be Laukiamanuikahiki, the king’s own daughter.” The other replied: “No, this cannot be the one, for she was to come in a red canoe having red sails, red paddles, red men, a large canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men; these I understand are the things that should accompany her; this girl on the other hand is a poor girl for she has come without any of these things.” The two again listened to the conversation between the owl and girl. After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter. They arrived at the home of Makiioeoe after midnight and roused him up saying: “Say, you wake up.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “There is an owl right over the pig house where the girl is held who called out to the girl in the following way:",
  "qwq-32b-awq-maui_translation": "<translation>A pair had just finished working when the guardians heard, they listened closely, and realized the words of the owl. One said to another: “Ah, this might be the girl of the chief, Laukiamanuikahiki.” Another replied: “No, it is not her; her canoe is red, her bird is red, her paddle is red, her people are red, her canoes are large, small, and long, her people are many and few—such is her way of coming. This is not an inferior girl.” They listened again to the owl’s words and those of Laukiamanuikahiki. “Let us go and tell the chief to care for the girl for this purpose.” They agreed. “Agreed.” They came before Chief Makiioeoe, who was sleeping, and called out: “Here, wake up!” “What?” said Makiioeoe. “An owl is above the puoa where the girl was caught. This is the owl’s message that we heard called out to the girl.”</translation>"
