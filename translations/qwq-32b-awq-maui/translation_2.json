  "reference_translation": "When Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui woke up in the morning and went out of doors, they saw a wooden dagger sticking in the ground just outside of the entrance. At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”",

Keinohoomanawanui then said to Kalelealuaka: “Let us perish! Here is the sword at the door of our house! It has arrived. We deeply love death; I must tell you to leave the chief behind—there are no words of death.”\n</translation>"
