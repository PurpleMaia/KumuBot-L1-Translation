He waa ia. Kuku ia ke kapa a iako, hahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he iako? He iako. Lawaia ka ia a loaa he ama, hahahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he ama? He ama ia.”",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”",

It is a canoe. Assembled the cloth and crossbeam, sunken into the gourd—could it not be a crossbeam? It is a crossbeam. Fished for the fish and found the outrigger, fully sunken into the gourd—could it not be an outrigger? It is an outrigger.\"  \n</translation>"
