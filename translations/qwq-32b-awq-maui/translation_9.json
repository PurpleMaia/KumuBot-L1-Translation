  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession.",
  "qwq-32b-awq-maui_translation": "<translation>\nAt Waiakea in Hilo is the land; Halepaki is the father, Wailea the mother. Wailea also has a younger sister named Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala. Born to this line was the great Kaipalaoa. His father went to Kauai, and there Kalanialiiloa died—a sacred chief of Kauai, a clever chief in governance, the one who caused the breaking of people’s bones, the place called Halepaiwi, a small yet enduring matter where the people’s bones were broken. Halepaki understood the governance, so he went to Kauai, where Kalanialiiloa died. Pueonuiokona is the chief of Kauai.\n</translation>"
