  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo.",
  "qwq-32b-awq-maui_translation": "<translation>\nIn this story, it is said that Kana's body was extremely long, and his large, smooth body stretched out. During his upbringing or nurturing, his body was pressed into the ridges, and his house, Halauoloolo, was also compressed; from the mountains down to the sea, his body formed the ridges, and so too was the building of the house, Halauoloolo.\n</translation>"
