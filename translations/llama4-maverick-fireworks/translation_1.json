  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair.",

Before he ate, Pikoiakaalala said, \"Listen all of you, I have a rule for eating, like this: 'No talking, no whispering, no smacking, no pinching, no murmuring,' until I finish eating.\" He reached for the pork and took one bite of the poi and sweet potato, and swallowed, then reached again, nearly finishing the whole pig and all the food from the oven. Someone said, \"This is food for the gods.\" Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His companions asked, \"If you were to stop eating, what would you eat?\" \"Nothing, I'm already full.\" \"Yes, we heard your rule,\" said his companions. After this eating by Pikoiakaalala, his body grew and he became a big and handsome man, except that his hair remained messy.</translation>\n\nLet me know if you have any further requests!"
