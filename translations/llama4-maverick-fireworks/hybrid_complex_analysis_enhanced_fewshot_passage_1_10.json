  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "When Puali'i died, Nāmakaokapāo'o went back to his mother, Pōka'ī, and the two of them stayed together. Nāmakaokapāo'o did not eat food. At that time, 'Ama'u, a chief of O'ahu, was living at Waikīkī. A man from Honouliuli arrived at Waikīkī where the chief was residing and said, \"O chief! There is a remarkable young boy who is very strong. His father has died, and his head was carried far out to sea, a long distance, five miles out.\" 'Ama'u heard this and thought, \"If I can get his strength when I kill him, but if I don't kill him, he has no strength.\" As he was speaking at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o heard these words about him.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is still not eating, possibly a sign of grief or a continued expression of his strong will and independence. \n– The name 'A-ma'u (fearless; or trembling) is introduced as an ali'i (chief) of O'ahu, residing at Wai-kīkī (spouting fresh water), a well-known location on O'ahu. \n• A man from Hono-uliuli (dark bay), likely a place with cultural or geographical significance related to the story's setting, arrives at Wai-kīkī and shares news about Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o with 'A-ma'u, highlighting Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's remarkable strength and the circumstances surrounding his father's death. The detail about Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's father's head being carried five miles out to sea is significant and may carry symbolic or literal meaning related to the story's themes or historical context.\n– The number five might be symbolic or represent a specific measure or distance significant in the narrative or Hawaiian culture.\n• 'A-ma'u's reaction to the news indicates his interest in Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's strength and his consideration of killing him to acquire that strength, showing the chief's pragmatic or perhaps ruthless nature. This reflects the complex dynamics and power struggles within the 'Ai Kapu era or the narrative's cultural context.\n– The fact that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o overhears 'A-ma'u's words suggests his proximity or the open nature of the conversation, potentially setting the stage for a confrontation or further developments in the story.\n• The introduction of 'A-ma'u and his interest in Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o adds a new layer to the narrative, exploring themes of power, strength, and the dynamics between chiefs and individuals within the story's cultural and historical framework.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
