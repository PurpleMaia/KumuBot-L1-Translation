  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i, a good man from Līhu‘e, arrived from inland to go fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to the home of Pōka‘ī. Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and liked her. He said, \"I'd like you to be my woman.\" Pōka‘ī replied, \"How could you possibly want me? I've given birth to a child and my body is ruined.\" Puali‘i said, \"I don't care about that. If you like me, let's sleep together.\" Pōka‘ī agreed and she went with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of Keahumoa to live.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**\n• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu'e (cold water, a place in 'Ewa, O'ahu, likely referring to the area now known as Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay, referring to a bay in 'Ewa, O'ahu), somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-'ī was living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. \n– In the 'Ai Kapu era, it was customary for people to walk on land to every destination, and it was normal to call in at the house of strangers and ask for food and water. Receiving strangers at one's home and providing them with food and water was considered a generous act, and refusing such requests was deemed rude. This custom is recounted in many Hawaiian stories and is likely the reason Pua-li'i called in at Pōka'ī's house and why Pōka'ī received Pua-li'i in her home, where he observed how she was living.\n• Pua-li'i falls in love with Pō-ka-'ī and proposes a long-term relationship. Pō-ka-'ī expresses hesitation due to a negative self-image, citing her having given birth to a child and her body being 'ino'ino (damaged, spoiled, or ruined), likely referring to the changes in her physical appearance after childbirth. \n– The term 'ino'ino may also carry connotations related to her spiritual or ritual purity, as childbirth was considered a time of ritual impurity in 'Ai Kapu culture. Pua-li'i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, they should begin a long-term relationship and acknowledge each other as kāne (boyfriend, husband, long-term lover) and wahine (girlfriend, wife, long-term lover).\n• The couple relocates to Ke-ahu-moa (the altar or heap of chickens, likely a metaphorical or poetic name for a place), in Līhu'e (Wāhiāwā), where Pua-li'i is from, to live. \n– The relocation to Ke-ahu-moa may signify a new beginning or a change in their lives, possibly symbolizing a transition from one social or ritual status to another. The name Ke-ahu-moa may also have esoteric or allegorical meaning related to the couple's new life together.",
