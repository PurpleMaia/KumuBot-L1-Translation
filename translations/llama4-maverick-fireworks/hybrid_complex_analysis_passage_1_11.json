  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "Then, he took his mother and hid her in the cave of Waipouli. When the mother was gone, he returned to their house at Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house, removed the thatching grass from the back and the front, and lay down in the middle right on top of the roof.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Then, he took his mother and hid her in the cave of Waipouli. When the mother was gone, he returned to their house at Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house, removed the thatching grass from the back and the front, and lay down in the middle right on top of the roof.</translation>\n\n<commentary>This passage is part of a larger narrative section that appears to be telling a story about a character, likely a legendary or historical figure, and their interactions with their mother and possibly other characters. The narrative seems to be describing a sequence of events involving hiding, returning home, and an action taken by Nāmakaokapāo'o, a name that is associated with a figure in Hawaiian legend, suggesting that this passage is drawing on traditional Hawaiian stories or mythology.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
