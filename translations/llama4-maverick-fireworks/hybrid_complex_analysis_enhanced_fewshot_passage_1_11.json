Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up to the roof of the house, removed the thatching from the back and front, and lay down in the middle on top of the roof.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Then, he took his mother and hid her in the cave of Waipouli. When the mother disappeared, he returned to their house at Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up to the roof of the house, removed the thatching from the back and front, and lay down in the middle on top of the roof.</translation>\n\n<commentary>**Paragraph 11:**• The narrative continues with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) taking his mother, Pō-ka-'ī (perhaps 'night falls upon the high chief'), to hide her in the cave of Wai-pouli (Water of the darkness/Pouli (darkness)), likely to protect her from his stepfather, Pua-li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), who had previously threatened to kill him; • The action of hiding Pō-ka-'ī in the cave signifies a protective measure, possibly indicating a strained relationship between Pua-li'i and Pō-ka-'ī or Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. – The cave, often a symbol of safety or refuge in Hawaiian narratives, serves as a temporary shelter for Pō-ka-'ī; • Upon returning to their house at Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens), Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o removes the thatching (mau'u) from the back (kua) and front (alo) of the roof, creating an opening or vulnerability in the structure. This act can be seen as a metaphor for exposing or revealing something, possibly related to the tensions within the household or the state of their relationships; • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o then lies down in the middle on top of the roof. This action could symbolize a position of power or control, as he is literally on top of the house. It may also signify a state of vigilance or watchfulness, as if he is guarding or overseeing the surroundings; • The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, and the actions associated with him, may be allegorically connected to the themes of insight, protection, and the challenging of existing social or familial norms. The etymology of his name, with 'nā maka' referring to 'the eyes' and 'pāo'o' likely being a poetic or alternate form of 'po'o' (head), suggests a connection to perception, awareness, or the symbolic 'head' or leadership. – In the context of the 'Ai Kapu era, such actions and the use of specific terms may carry additional layers of meaning related to the cultural and religious practices of the time, including the potential subversion or critique of these practices through the narrative.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
