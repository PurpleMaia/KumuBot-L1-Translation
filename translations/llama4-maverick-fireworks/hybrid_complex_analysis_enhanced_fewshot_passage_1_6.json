  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo'o was busy tearing apart one sweet potato patch on top of another sweet potato patch. He tore apart both sweet potato patches until there was a pile of sweet potato leaves, forty piles from the two patches. Then Nāmakaokapāo'o returned and lit a fire to broil four sweet potato vines on a burning fire pit. As he was broiling them on the fire, his stepfather returned and arrived, and asked his mother, Pōka'ī, who said, \"No.\" Puali'i said, \"Yes, his head and eyes are what will accompany my sweet potatoes today, so today is the day he will die by my hand.\"",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**\n• The actions described in this paragraph are symbolic and likely carry deeper meanings related to the cultural context and the characters involved. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, a young boy, is engaging in destructive behavior by tearing apart the sweet potato patches. \n– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) is significant. 'Maka' can refer to eyes, and 'pāo'o' may be a poetic or metaphorical reference to 'po'o' (head), suggesting a connection between the name and the body parts mentioned later in the passage (head and eyes).\n• The numbers mentioned (2, 4, 40) are noteworthy and may represent a riddle or have esoteric significance, potentially tied to the cultural or spiritual practices of the time. \n– The destruction of the two sweet potato patches resulting in forty piles could symbolize abundance or a significant event. \n– The broiling of four sweet potato vines may be related to the number's significance in Hawaiian culture or ritual practices.\n• Puali'i's reaction to Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions is one of extreme anger, culminating in a threat to kill him and use his head and eyes as accompaniments to his sweet potatoes. \n– This threat is particularly significant given the cultural context. In the 'Ai Kapu era, certain practices and taboos governed the consumption of food and the treatment of human bodies. \n– The mention of eating someone's head and eyes with sweet potatoes is a reversal or subversion of normal practices and may indicate Puali'i's adherence to or nostalgia for the 'Ai Kapu customs, or it may symbolize a deeper conflict or allegorical meaning.\n• The head (po'o) and eyes (nā maka) are symbolically significant in Hawaiian culture, potentially representing leadership, insight, or the continuation of life (in the case of 'maka' relating to the sprouting or 'eyes' of plants like sweet potatoes).\n– The reference to using Nāmakaokapāo'o's head and eyes with sweet potatoes, instead of ulua fish (a known substitute for human sacrifice in 'Ai Kapu practices), suggests a complex layering of cultural references and potential allegory for the abandonment or critique of 'Ai Kapu practices.\n• The conflict between Nāmakaokapāo'o and Puali'i may symbolize a generational or ideological clash, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing a more progressive or disruptive force, and Puali'i embodying a more traditional or conservative viewpoint.\n– This dynamic is further complicated by Puali'i being Nāmakaokapāo'o's stepfather, indicating a familial or societal tension that is being played out through their interactions.",

  "reference_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \\[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;"
