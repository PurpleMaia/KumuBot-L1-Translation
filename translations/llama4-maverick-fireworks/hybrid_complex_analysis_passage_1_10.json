  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "Puali‘i died, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned and reached her mother, Pōka‘ī, and they stayed together. Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat any food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief on O‘ahu, residing at Waikīkī. A man from Honouliuli came and arrived at Waikīkī, where the chief was residing, and said, \"O chief! There is a remarkable young boy, very strong; his father has died and his head was carried far out to sea, a long distance, five miles long.\" When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, \"If his strength is like that, I will surely die by his hand, but if I do not die by his hand, he has no strength.\" While he was speaking at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words about her.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The story seems to be setting the stage for a confrontation or interaction between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and ‘Ama‘u, with the former having been affected by the death of her father, Puali‘i, and the latter being informed about a potentially powerful young individual, who is later revealed to be Nāmakaokapāo‘o herself.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
