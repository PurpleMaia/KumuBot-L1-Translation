  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "Then Puali‘i grasped the adze and went until he reached Nāmakaokapāo‘o, who was roasting his four taro tops on the fire. All the children saw him and ran to stand at a distance, fearing Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, \"Hey! Here is the adze in my hand, it is a thing to cut off your head today, and when your head is cut off, then it will be cooked with taro, and I will eat it first, and then it will be free from kapu.\" Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not listen to Puali‘i's words, and then Puali‘i spoke again, a second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut off Nāmakaokapāo‘o's head with the adze when Nāmakaokapāo‘o prayed his death prayer for Puali‘i. The prayer went like this: \nPity the eyes of my dear one, \nThey are closing, they are fixed, \nPerhaps they will eat, perhaps they will leave, \nPerhaps Nākukui‘aimakaokalani will leave, \nThat is Kukui‘aimakaokalani, \nThis is my dear companion, \nNāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i, \nSlipping away, the lazy one slips away, \nIt is people with spears, \nIt is spears with clubs, \nNāmakaokapāo‘o will surely die.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "This passage is rich in cultural, historical, and linguistic significance, offering insights into ancient Hawaiian society, its values, and practices. Here's a breakdown of these aspects:\n\n1. **Cultural Context**: The passage revolves around a confrontation between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, involving a threat of violence and a prayer. It highlights the importance of understanding the social dynamics and the kapu (taboo) system in ancient Hawaii. The mention of an adze (ko‘ilipi) and the act of roasting taro tops ('au 'uala) on the fire are indicative of everyday activities and the tools used. The fear exhibited by the children upon seeing Puali‘i with an adze underscores the gravity of the situation and the potential for violence.\n\n2. **Linguistic Features**: The passage is characterized by the use of classical Hawaiian, which is distinct from modern Hawaiian due to its more complex grammatical structures and vocabulary. The use of \"akula\" and \"aila\" indicates a narrative progression and is typical of classical Hawaiian storytelling. The dialogue between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, particularly the threat and the subsequent prayer, showcases the poetic and metaphorical nature of Hawaiian oratory. The prayer itself is a fine example of Hawaiian poetic composition, with its use of metaphor (e.g., \"Pity the eyes of my dear one\"), parallelism (\"e hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei\"), and invocation of specific names and concepts.\n\n3. **Historical Significance**: The names mentioned, such as Puali‘i, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Nāmakaokai‘a, are significant as they relate to historical or legendary figures. Nāmakaokai‘a being referred to as the \"great chief of Hawai‘i\" suggests a connection to the ruling ali‘i class, indicating the passage's roots in historical or quasi-historical narratives. The content and structure of the prayer, with its references to specific individuals and the use of particular imagery, may also provide clues about the historical context and the cultural practices of the time.\n\n4. **Analysis of the Prayer**: The prayer recited by Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a crucial element of the passage. It is a death prayer (pule make) aimed at Puali‘i, invoking various images and names that are not fully explained within the passage. The prayer's structure and content suggest a complex interplay of emotions, loyalties, and spiritual beliefs. The reference to \"Nākukui‘aimakaokalani\" and \"Kukui‘aimakaokalani\" may be related to specific deities or ancestral figures, highlighting the spiritual dimension of Hawaiian culture. The final lines, with their reference to \"people with spears\" and \"spears with clubs,\" followed by the assertion that \"Nāmakaokapāo‘o will surely die,\" indicate a fatalistic or prophetic tone, underscoring the gravity of the confrontation.\n\nIn conclusion, this passage offers a window into the cultural practices, linguistic nuances, and historical narratives of ancient Hawaii. Its analysis requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from Hawaiian language, history, and cultural studies to fully appreciate its significance.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
