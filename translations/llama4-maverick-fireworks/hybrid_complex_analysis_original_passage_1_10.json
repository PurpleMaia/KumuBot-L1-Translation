  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "Puali‘i died, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned and reached her mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo‘o ate no food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief on O‘ahu, residing at Waikīkī. A man came from Honouliuli and reached Waikīkī where the chief resided. He said: \"O chief! There is a remarkable young boy, very strong; his father has died and his head was washed out to sea, a long distance, five miles away.\" When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, \"If he is as strong as they say, I will surely die at his hands; however, if I do not die at his hands, then he has no strength.\" While he was speaking at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words about her.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The chapter is setting the stage for the introduction of a powerful young boy and the potential conflict or interaction between him and the chief ‘Ama‘u, with Nāmakaokapāo‘o being a key character who overhears the conversation about the boy's abilities. The narrative is rich in cultural and geographical references, including locations such as Waikīkī and Honouliuli on the island of O‘ahu.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
