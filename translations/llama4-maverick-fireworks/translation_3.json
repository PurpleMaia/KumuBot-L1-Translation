  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",

When they reached the base of the koa tree, Kauakahi stayed behind with the hokeo ie. At that time, Keawenuiaumi's canoe builders shouted from the base of the koa tree, as the birds perched on it, calling out: \"Hey, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, it's rotten. It's a bad canoe, a rotten canoe. It's a canoe that can't go to sea.\"\n\n<translation>On the second day at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went to the koa tree where the birds were calling, carrying the hokeo ie.
