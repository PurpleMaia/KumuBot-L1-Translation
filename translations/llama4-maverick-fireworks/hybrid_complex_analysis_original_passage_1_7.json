  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "Then Puali‘i seized the adze and went until he reached Nāmakaokapāo‘o, who was roasting his four sweet potato tubers on the fire. All the children saw this and ran to stand at a distance out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, \"Hey! Here is the adze in my hand, it is a thing to chop off your head today; if your head is severed, then it will be roasted with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat it first, and then it will be free from kapu.\" Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not heed these words of Puali‘i, so Puali‘i spoke again, a second time. Puali‘i was ready to chop off Nāmakaokapāo‘o's head with the adze when Nāmakaokapāo‘o prayed his death prayer for Puali‘i. The prayer went like this:\n\"Oh, the sorrowful eyes of my dear pāo‘o,\nAre clouding over, are getting stuck together,\nWill they eat or will they leave it,\nWill Nākukui‘aimakaokalani leave it?\nThat is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,\nThis is my dear companion,\nNāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i,\nLet it flow, let the hōhē (a type of fish) flow freely,\nIt is people with spears,\nIt is spears with clubs,\nDeath will come to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.\"",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "The passage is an excerpt from a traditional Hawaiian narrative, likely from a mo‘olelo (story or history) about the chief Nāmakaokapāo‘o. The story revolves around a confrontation between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, where Puali‘i threatens to behead Nāmakaokapāo‘o with an adze.\n\nCulturally, this passage reflects the significance of chiefly status and the kapu system in ancient Hawaiian society. Nāmakaokapāo‘o is referred to as an \"ali‘i nui\" (high chief), indicating his elevated status. The use of the term \"kapu\" and the concept of making something \"noa\" (free from restriction) by eating it first, highlights the complex system of ritual prohibitions that governed ancient Hawaiian life.\n\nLinguistically, the passage is rich in features characteristic of traditional Hawaiian narrative. The use of verbs like \"lālau\" (to seize), \"hele\" (to go), and \"‘ōlelo\" (to say) followed by directional particles (\"akula,\" \"maila\") is typical of Hawaiian storytelling, creating a sense of movement and action. The incorporation of direct speech, particularly the prayer, adds to the narrative's vividness and emotional impact.\n\nThe prayer itself is a significant aspect of the passage, showcasing the spiritual and religious practices of ancient Hawaiians. The imagery and metaphor used in the prayer, such as \"Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o\" (Oh, the sorrowful eyes of my dear pāo‘o), convey a sense of deep emotion and spiritual connection. The reference to \"Nākukui‘aimakaokalani\" and \"Kukui‘aimakaokalani\" suggests a cosmological or spiritual dimension, possibly linking the chief to divine or ancestral powers.\n\nHistorically, while the passage does not provide specific dates or events that can be cross-referenced with Western historical records, it offers insight into the cultural practices, social hierarchy, and spiritual beliefs of pre-contact Hawaiian society. The narrative likely originated in an oral tradition, passed down through generations before being written down, and reflects the values and concerns of the Hawaiian people during that time.\n\nFurthermore, the use of specific names like \"Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" and \"Puali‘i\" may indicate that the story is rooted in historical or legendary events specific to certain regions or families in Hawai‘i. The story could be used to explain natural phenomena, the origins of certain families or chiefly lines, or to convey moral lessons.\n\nThe linguistic features, such as the use of metaphor (\"ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o\" - the eyes of my dear pāo‘o), symbolize the connection between spiritual entities and the physical world, emphasizing the holistic view of the world held by ancient Hawaiians.\n\nIn conclusion, this passage is a window into the rich cultural, spiritual, and historical heritage of Hawai‘i, providing insights into the lives, beliefs, and practices of ancient Hawaiians through its narrative and poetic elements.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
