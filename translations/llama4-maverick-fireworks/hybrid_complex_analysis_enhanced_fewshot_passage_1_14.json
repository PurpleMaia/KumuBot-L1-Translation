When 'Ama'u and his people arrived in 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o was busy destroying everything, leaving no one alive, and 'Ama'u was killed.

  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

'A-ma'u (the ma'u (fern) or (tremble)), is the name of a fern native to Hawai'i, likely used here as a metaphor or a poetic reference to the character's nature or actions. The number of war canoes, 'umi-kuma-māwalu (18), is specific and might hold symbolic meaning or significance in the context of the narrative. \n– The preparation of eighteen war canoes indicates 'Ama'u's readiness for battle and highlights the scale of the conflict between 'Ama'u and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o.\n• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's destruction is described as thorough, leaving no one alive in 'Ewa, demonstrating his incredible strength and martial prowess. 'Ama'u's defeat signifies Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's superiority in battle.\n• After 'Ama'u's death, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is said to have conquered O'ahu completely (puni), indicating his dominance over the island. The term \"puni\" implies a comprehensive victory or control.\n• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o then retrieves his mother, Pō-ka-'ī, and installs her in a position of authority (ho'onoho) over O'ahu. This act suggests that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o values his mother's influence and possibly seeks to legitimize his rule through her. It also indicates a level of respect or devotion towards his mother, as well as potentially transferring some of his power to her.\n– The act of placing Pō-ka-'ī in authority could be seen as a gesture of consolidation of power and an attempt to stabilize the region under his control by having a figure he trusts in a position of leadership. This action may also reflect the cultural significance of maternal lineage and the role of women in Hawaiian chiefly societies.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
