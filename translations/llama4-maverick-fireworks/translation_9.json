  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "Here is the translation of the Hawaiian text to English, wrapped in <translation> </translation> tags:\n\n<translation>\nThe land was Waiakea in Hilo, Halepaki was the father, and Wailea was the mother. Wailea also had a younger sibling, Kalenaihaleauau, who was the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala. Kaipalaoa was born and grew up, and then his father went to Kauai, where he killed Kalanialiiloa, a sacred chief of Kauai, who was a skilled debater and was known for having \"broken the bones\" of people, specifically Halepaiwi, with only a small area remaining untouched where people's bones were not broken. Halepaki was familiar with debating and had learned it, but he was not skilled. He went to Kauai and killed Kalanialiiloa. Pueonuiokona was the chief of Kauai.\n</translation>\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments!"
