  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know that Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great person, and he has gone to Ko'olau, and I am his name.\" They said, \"No, you are the one. That is what we heard. Therefore, you will die by our hands, you will not survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Let's all go down and fight.\" When they reached down, Nāmakaokapāo'o killed them all until they were completely dead, leaving one man. He was the one who ran and reached 'Ama'u at Waikīkī and told him about the death of all of them, and he was the sole survivor to report the news to 'Ama'u.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The name may thus signify someone with great perception or foresight who is a leader or of high status.\n• The dialogue between Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and his adversaries reveals a complex interplay of identity and threat. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o attempts to deflect the attack by suggesting he is merely a namesake, implying there is another Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o in Ko'olau (the windward side), potentially referring to a different person or a symbolic or spiritual entity; \n– The threat made by the group against Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is based on hearsay or prior information (\"pela ko makou lohe\" - that's what we heard), indicating a premeditated intent to kill him, highlighting the danger and tension in the situation.\n• The narrative showcases Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's exceptional strength and martial prowess as he defeats his adversaries, a feat that aligns with his characterization as incredibly strong in the opening paragraphs; \n– The survival of one individual who escapes to Waikīkī to inform 'Ama'u about the outcome of the battle serves to advance the plot and potentially introduce new conflicts or tensions, as news of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's actions spreads.\n• The toponym Waikīkī, the location where the sole survivor reaches 'Ama'u, is significant as it refers to a specific place on O'ahu known for its springs or fresh water sources. The name 'Ama'u, potentially derived from the 'ama'u fern, may symbolize strength, resilience, or transformation, depending on the cultural significance attributed to the 'ama'u fern in Hawaiian tradition.\n• This episode can be interpreted allegorically as a representation of the struggle between different factions or ideologies within the narrative's cultural context, possibly reflecting historical or societal conflicts related to the 'Ai Kapu era or other significant periods in Hawaiian history. The victory of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may symbolize the triumph of a particular viewpoint or the advent of a new era, with the defeated group representing an opposing force or outdated practices.</commentary>",

So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
