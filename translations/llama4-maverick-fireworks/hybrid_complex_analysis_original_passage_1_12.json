  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "'Ama'u, the chief from Waikīkī, sent four war parties, with each group consisting of forty-eight people, making that many in total for all four groups. When they arrived at the school of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but found no one. Just as they were about to leave, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from above the ridgepole. They heard the voice, but saw no body. They asked, \"Where are you, the one speaking?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied, \"I'm right here above.\" Eight men climbed up, four from the back of the house and four from the front, and they found Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o asked them, \"What's brought you people here?\" They replied, \"We've come to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o. He's just a small boy, like you, but strong and very brave. He's the one who killed his own father, Puali'i.\"",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The story is likely drawn from traditional Hawaiian oral literature or historical accounts, and provides insight into the cultural values and practices of ancient Hawai'i, such as the importance of chiefly authority and the reputation of individuals for strength and martial prowess. The narrative may be exploring themes related to power, violence, and the complexities of chiefly rule in ancient Hawaiian society.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
