  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "Puali'i grasped the cutting knife and went until he reached Nāmakaokapāo'o, who was broiling his four sweet potato vines over the fire. All the children saw him and ran to stand at a distance, fearing Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o, \"Hey! Here's the cutting knife in my hand, it's to cut off your head today, and when your head is severed, we'll bake it with sweet potatoes, and I'll eat it first, and then it'll be free (from kapu).\" Nāmakaokapāo'o didn't listen to Puali'i's words, and then Puali'i spoke again, a second time. Puali'i was ready to cut Nāmakaokapāo'o with the knife when Nāmakaokapāo'o prayed his death prayer for Puali'i. The prayer went like this: \n\"Aloha, the eye of my pāo'o fish,\nGathering, assembling here,\nTo eat perhaps, or perhaps to leave,\nPerhaps Nākukui‘aimakaokalani will leave it,\nThat is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,\nThis is my aikāne companion,\nNāmakaokai‘a, the high chief of Hawai'i,\nSlipping away, the foolish one slips away,\nPeople with spears,\nSpear with shield,\nDeath to Nāmakaokapāo'o.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "• **Paragraph 7:** The confrontation between Pua-li'i and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o escalates as Pua-li'i approaches Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o with a cutting knife (ko'i lipi), intending to kill him. The other children present flee in fear, highlighting the fearsome reputation or presence of Pua-li'i. \n– The use of the cutting knife is significant as it is a tool associated with manual labor and, in this context, with violence. Pua-li'i's intention to behead Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and bake the head with sweet potatoes is a grave threat, symbolizing the ultimate form of dominance or control.\n• The speech by Pua-li'i to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o includes a threat not just to kill him but to consume his head with sweet potatoes, mirroring the 'Ai Kapu practice of sacrificing humans and offering them to the gods, but here it is twisted as Pua-li'i intends to eat Nā-maka-okapāo'o's head himself. This act, if carried out, would be a desecration in the context of 'Ai Kapu beliefs.\n– The response of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is to pray a death prayer (pule make) for Puali'i instead of reacting with violence or compliance. This prayer is significant as it contains references that are both poetic and esoteric.\n• The prayer recited by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is a form of spiritual counterattack. Breaking down the names and terms used in the prayer:\n– **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o**: (The eyes of the pāo'o fish), a name that might symbolize insight or the ability to see beyond the surface level.\n– **Nā-kuku-i‘aima-ka-o-kalani** and **Kukui‘aimaokaokalani**: These names seem to be related to the concept of light (kukui means light or candle nut) and possibly refer to celestial or divine entities or concepts. \n– **Nā-maka-okai‘a**: (The eyes of the sea or possibly a personal name related to the sea) is referred to as the high chief (ali'i nui) of Hawai'i, suggesting a connection to high-ranking chiefs or divine beings associated with Hawai'i.\n– The prayer seems to call upon various spiritual entities or concepts to act against Puali'i, using imagery that might be interpreted as calling for chaos or disorder (\"Slipping away, the foolish one slips away, People with spears, Spear with shield\"). \n• The overall tone and content of the prayer suggest a rich layer of cultural and spiritual references, underscoring the complexity of Hawaiian spiritual practices and the significance of names and epithets in these contexts.\n• The act of praying a death prayer for Puali'i can be seen as Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o employing spiritual or supernatural means to counter the physical threat posed by Puali'i, reflecting the belief in the power of prayer and spiritual forces in Hawaiian culture during this period.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
