He waa ia. Kuku ia ke kapa a iako, hahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he iako? He iako. Lawaia ka ia a loaa he ama, hahahao ia iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he ama? He ama ia.”",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "To translate the given Hawaiian text into English, let's first break down the text and understand its components.\n\nThe text is a dialogue between older people (`na kanaka makua`) and a young boy (`ke keiki`). The dialogue involves a riddle or a test of wit regarding the identity of certain objects when they are treated or transformed in some way.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. The older people say: “Keiki wahahee; pau no ka waa iloko o ka ipu, e laa me ka iako, ke ama?” \n   - This translates to: “You are a deceitful child; if the canoe (`waa`) is put inside a calabash (`ipu`), along with the outrigger boom (`iako`) and the outrigger (`ama`), what are they?”\n\n2. The boy responds with a series of statements that follow a pattern:\n   - `I aku ke keiki: “Kuku ia ke kapa a kiwaawaa, hahao iloko o ka ipu, aole ia la he waa? He waa ia.` \n     - This translates to: \"The boy said: 'If a cloth (`kapa`) is torn (`kuku`) into strips (`kiwaawaa`) and put (`hahao`) inside a calabash (`ipu`), isn't it a canoe (`waa`)? It is a canoe.'\"\n   - The boy then applies the same logic to the `iako` (outrigger boom) and `ama` (outrigger), saying that if they are similarly treated (torn into strips and put inside a calabash), they retain their identities as `iako` and `ama`, respectively.\n\nThe essence of the boy's response is that the identity of an object is not changed by altering its form or placing it in a different context; it remains what it is.\n\nSo, the translation of the given Hawaiian text into English is:\n\n<translation>The elders said: “Deceitful child; if a canoe is put inside a calabash, along with the outrigger boom and the outrigger, what are they?” The boy said: “If a cloth is torn into strips and put inside a calabash, isn’t it a canoe? It is a canoe. If it is torn into strips to be an outrigger boom and put inside a calabash, isn’t it an outrigger boom? It is an outrigger boom. If a fish (`ia`) is caught (`lawaia`) and becomes an outrigger (`ama`), and is put inside a calabash, isn’t it an outrigger? It is an outrigger.”</translation>\n\nNote that there was a slight adjustment in the final part of the translation to better reflect the original text's meaning and to correct \"lawaia ka ia\" to its appropriate interpretation, which involves catching a fish, but in the context given, it seems to directly relate to obtaining or having an `ama`. However, sticking closely to the original, the translation aims to preserve the original's intent and dialogue."
