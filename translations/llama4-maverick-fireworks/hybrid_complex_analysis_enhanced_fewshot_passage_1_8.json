  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "Here, a little will be said about those two names, Nā-maka-o-ka-lani and Nā-maka-o-kai‘a; the two were high chiefs of Hawai'i, Nā-maka-o-ka-lani being the father and Nā-maka-o-kai‘a being the son, but they are confused with Nāmakaokapāo'o.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph provides a clarifying note regarding two names, Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the sky/heaven) and Nā-maka-o-kai‘a (the eyes of the Kai‘a (a type of fish)), which are associated with high chiefs of Hawai'i; – The name Nā-maka-o-ka-lani is broken down as: Nā-maka (the eyes) -o- (of) ka- (the) lani (sky/heaven); Nā-maka-o-kai‘a is broken down as: Nā-maka (the eyes) -o- (of) kai‘a (Kai‘a, a type of fish); • The passage establishes a familial relationship between the two individuals bearing these names, with Nā-maka-o-ka-lani being the father (makua kāne) and Nā-maka-o-kai‘a being the son (keiki); • The text notes that these two individuals are sometimes confused or merged with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, suggesting that there may be overlapping narratives, genealogical complexities, or instances of mistaken identity among these figures; – This confusion could be due to the similarity in their names, all starting with \"Nā-maka-o-ka-\" and having a similar structure; it may also reflect the complexities of oral tradition and the transmission of historical or mythological accounts; • The reference to these individuals as \"ali'i nui\" (high chiefs) indicates their significant status within the societal hierarchy of Hawai'i, highlighting the importance of genealogical connections and the potential for multiple interpretations of historical or legendary figures; – In the context of 'Ai Kapu era, the distinction and confusion between different ali'i and their genealogies could have significant cultural and religious implications, including the legitimacy of rule and the connection to divine or ancestral authority.",

  "reference_translation": "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity."
