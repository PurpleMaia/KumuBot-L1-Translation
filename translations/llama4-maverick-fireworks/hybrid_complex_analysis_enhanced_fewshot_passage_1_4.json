There were two long sweet potato patches that are still there to this day, and the name given to these patches is Nāmakaokapāo‘o to this day. When the sweet potatoes were mature, Puali‘i spoke his vow, saying, \"When the head of the ulua fish and sweet potatoes are cooked, Puali‘i will eat, and then it will be free [from kapu], and his woman, Pōka‘ī, and others will eat. So, Puali‘i went down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for a fish to eat with the sweet potatoes.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "• The passage describes Puali'i and Pōka'ī settling into their life together, with Puali'i working the land and having two long sweet potato patches; • The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is given to the two sweet potato patches, likely due to the story of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, Pōka'ī's son from a previous relationship, and his destructive behavior described in previous paragraphs. The name is a reference to the eyes (nā maka) of the pāo'o fish, which is a poetic way of referring to the head (po'o). This name etymology suggests a deep connection between the land, the people, and their stories;\n– The use of the name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o for the sweet potato patches implies that the land is tied to the narrative of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and his family, highlighting the importance of storytelling in Hawaiian culture and the connection between people and the 'āina (land);\n• Puali'i makes a vow (ʻōlelo hoʻohiki) regarding the cooking and eating of the ulua fish and sweet potatoes, indicating that the consumption of these foods is tied to a specific ritual or cultural practice. In the 'Ai Kapu era, certain foods were kapu (forbidden) until they were properly consecrated or until certain rituals were performed;\n– The mention of cooking the head (po'o) of the ulua fish with sweet potatoes is significant, as it references the ulua fish being used as a substitute for human sacrifice in 'Ai Kapu culture. The head of the ulua fish represents the symbolic substitution for human sacrifice, highlighting the cultural significance of this practice;\n• The act of Puali'i going fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to catch a fish to eat with the sweet potatoes suggests that the couple is preparing for a meal that is significant in their cultural context. The fact that Puali'i goes fishing after making his vow implies that the meal is a crucial aspect of their cultural practice;\n– The passage highlights the importance of food and its preparation in Hawaiian culture, particularly in relation to the 'Ai Kapu era. The kapu system governed many aspects of Hawaiian life, including the consumption of food. The fact that Puali'i and Pōka'ī will eat together after the food is consecrated or made noa (free from kapu) underscores the significance of shared meals in Hawaiian culture.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
