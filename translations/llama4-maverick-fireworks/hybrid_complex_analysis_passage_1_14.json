  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "'Ama'u heard, and he prepared his eighteen war canoes and sailed down to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u and his people arrived at 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o was still wreaking havoc, leaving no one alive, and 'Ama'u was killed. Nāmakaokapāo'o conquered all of O'ahu, and then he went to get his mother and placed her in charge of the land of O'ahu.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The narrative seems to be detailing the conquest of O'ahu by Nāmakaokapāo'o and the aftermath of this event.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
