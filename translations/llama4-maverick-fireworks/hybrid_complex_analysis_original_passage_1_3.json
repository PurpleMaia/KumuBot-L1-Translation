  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "While they were living there, Puali‘i, a good man from Līhu‘e, descended and was fishing at sea off Honouliuli. He visited at the house of Pōka‘ī. Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and desired her, and he said to her, “I want you as my wife.” Pōka‘ī replied, “How can you desire me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is defiled.” Puali‘i said, “These things are nothing, if you desire me, we can be together.” Pōka‘ī agreed. And Pōka‘ī returned with her husband and Puali‘i to the uplands of Keahumoa, where they lived.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "The passage is rich in cultural and historical context, as well as linguistic features that are characteristic of the Hawaiian language. Here's a detailed analysis:\n\nThe passage begins by setting a scene of Puali‘i visiting Pōka‘ī while her husband is present. This encounter is significant because it reveals the cultural norms surrounding relationships and marriage in ancient Hawaiian society. Puali‘i's declaration of desire for Pōka‘ī, despite her having a child and being potentially considered \"defiled\" (according to certain interpretations of 'ino'ino), highlights the complexities of Hawaiian cultural values regarding marriage, family, and personal relationships.\n\nFrom a linguistic perspective, the passage is written in a formal, narrative style typical of traditional Hawaiian storytelling. The use of verbs like \"iho maila\" (descended) and \"kipa maila\" (visited) provides a sense of movement and action. The sentence structure and word order also follow traditional Hawaiian narrative patterns.\n\nOne notable aspect is the way the passage handles sensitive topics, such as Pōka‘ī's past and Puali‘i's desire for her. The text does not shy away from discussing these subjects directly, which suggests a cultural context where such matters were handled openly. Pōka‘ī's initial hesitation and Puali‘i's response indicate a negotiation of social norms and personal desires.\n\nHistorically, this passage is likely part of a larger narrative that provides insight into the lives and societal norms of Native Hawaiians in a specific time period. Although the exact date is not provided, the story appears to be set in a pre-colonial or early colonial context, given the lack of Western influence in the narrative. The geographical locations mentioned, such as Līhu‘e, Honouliuli, and Keahumoa, are significant as they locate the story within a specific Hawaiian cultural landscape.\n\nThe language used is Classical Hawaiian, characterized by its distinct grammatical structures and vocabulary. For example, the use of directional particles (e.g., \"maila\") and the verb \"makemake\" to express desire are typical of this style. The passage also employs a polite or formal register, as seen in the use of honorific language and the careful handling of sensitive topics.\n\nOverall, this passage offers a unique window into Hawaiian cultural practices, social norms, and linguistic traditions. It highlights the complexity and nuance of Hawaiian society, challenging simplistic or stereotypical understandings of Native Hawaiian culture. By analyzing this text, we gain a deeper understanding of the historical and cultural context in which it was written, as well as the linguistic features that characterize Hawaiian narrative traditions.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
