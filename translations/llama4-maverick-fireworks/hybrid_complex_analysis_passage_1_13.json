  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"I know that Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great person, and he has gone to Ko'olau, and I am his name.\" They replied: \"No, it is you, that is what we have heard, therefore, you will die by our hands, you will not live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Let's all go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o was killed, all of them died, except for one person, he is the one who ran and was found by 'Ama'u at Waikīkī, and he told of the death of all of them, except that he was left to tell the news so that 'Ama'u would hear.",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"I know that Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great person, and he has gone to Ko'olau, and I am his name.\" They replied: \"No, it is you, that is what we have heard, therefore, you will die by our hands, you will not live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Let's all go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o was killed, all of them died, except for one person, he is the one who ran and was found by 'Ama'u at Waikīkī, and he told of the death of all of them, except that he was left to tell the news so that 'Ama'u would hear.</translation>\n\n<commentary>This passage is part of a larger narrative section that appears to be recounting a legendary or historical event involving Nāmakaokapāo'o, a figure likely associated with Hawaiian mythology or history. The story involves a confrontation between Nāmakaokapāo'o and a group of individuals, resulting in a significant loss of life. The narrative is characteristic of traditional Hawaiian storytelling, which often conveys cultural values, historical events, or mythological themes through oral or written accounts.</commentary>\n\nFurther analysis of the passage reveals several interesting cultural, historical, and linguistic aspects:\n\n1. **Linguistic Features**: The passage employs traditional Hawaiian language structures and vocabulary, including the use of ʻokina (glottal stops) and kahakō (macrons) to indicate vowel length and pronunciation. The text demonstrates a formal, narrative style characteristic of Hawaiian storytelling.\n\n2. **Cultural Significance**: The story involves a confrontation and a significant loss of life, which may be related to historical or mythological events in Hawaiian culture. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a figure associated with Pele, the volcano goddess, in Hawaiian mythology. The narrative may be connected to the broader context of Pele stories and the cultural significance of these stories in Hawaiian tradition.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: While the passage does not provide a specific historical date, it is likely part of a larger oral or written tradition that has been passed down through generations. The events described may be rooted in historical or pre-contact Hawaiian society, offering insights into the culture, conflicts, and values of that time.\n\n4. **Narrative Structure**: The passage is structured around a dialogue between Nāmakaokapāo'o and an unnamed group, followed by a description of the consequences of their confrontation. This structure is typical of Hawaiian narratives, which often use dialogue and action to convey themes and events.\n\n5. **Themes and Symbolism**: The story touches on themes of identity, conflict, and survival. Nāmakaokapāo'o's claim that he is \"his name\" (inoa nona) suggests a deeper exploration of identity and possibly the power or significance associated with names in Hawaiian culture. The survival of one individual to tell the story also highlights the importance of oral tradition and the role of messengers or storytellers in Hawaiian society.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
