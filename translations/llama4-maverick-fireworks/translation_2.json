  "reference_translation": "When Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui woke up in the morning and went out of doors, they saw a wooden dagger sticking in the ground just outside of the entrance. At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”",
  "llama4-maverick-fireworks_translation": "To translate the given Hawaiian text into English, let's break it down and analyze it step by step.\n\n1. **\"O Kalelealuaka a me Keinohoomanawanui, i ko laua ala ana i ke kakahiaka a hele iwaho o ka hale\"** translates to \"Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, when they arose in the morning and went out of the house\".\n\n2. **\"iko iho la laua he pahoa e ku ana ma ka puka o ka hale, ua kukuluia\"** translates to \"they saw a spear standing at the door of the house, it was erected/standing there\".\n\n3. **\"I aku o Keinohoomanawanui ia Kalelealuaka: 'Make kaua!'\"** translates to \"Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: 'We are doomed!' or 'We're going to die!'\".\n\n4. **\"'Eia la he pahoa ma ka puka o ka hale o kaua! Ua loaa'\"** translates to \"'Here is a spear at the door of our house! It is found/obtained'\".\n\n5. **\"'Aloha ino kaua i ka make; o ka’u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe e waiho ke ’lii, aohe make olelo'\"** translates to \"'We are unlucky in death; I was just about to tell you to leave the chief, there is no exemption from death'\".\n\nPutting it all together, the translation is:\n\n<translation>Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, when they arose in the morning and went out of the house, saw a spear standing at the door of the house, it was erected there. Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: \"We're going to die! Here is a spear at the door of our house! It is found. We are unlucky in death; I was just about to tell you to leave the chief, there is no exemption from death.\"</translation>"
