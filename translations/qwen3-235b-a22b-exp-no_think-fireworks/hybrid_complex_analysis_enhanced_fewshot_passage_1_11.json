Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nThen he took his mother and hid her in the cave of Waipouli. And when the mother was gone, he returned to their house at Keahumoa and lived there alone. Then Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed onto the roof of the house, tore away the thatch of the back and front, and lay down right in the center on top of the roof.\n</translation>\n\n<Commentary>\n**Paragraph 11:**\n\n• The narrative continues the thematic motif of isolation, rebellion, and symbolic confrontation with authority and family that has been carefully crafted since the early chapters of Nāmakaokapāo'o's story. The act of taking his mother to hide her away from Pualiʻi, her new husband, points to both a protective impulse and a rejection of the new family structure introduced by her remarriage.\n\n– The location, *Waipouli (wai-pouli: dark water or hidden water)*, holds symbolic weight. Caves (*ana*) in traditional Hawaiian thought were often places of refuge, concealment, and in some cases, communication with *ʻaumākua* or ancestral spirits (Beckwith 1951). By hiding his mother in the cave of Waipouli, Nāmakaokapāo'o is not only physically separating her from the domestic space dominated by Pualiʻi but possibly engaging in a symbolic reclamation of maternal sacredness, removing her from a space where the *ʻAi Kapu* traditions may have been maintained by the new husband.\n\n– The name *Waipouli* resonates with themes of concealment (*pouli* = darkened or shaded), often connected in Hawaiʻi with mystery or the unseen. This matches with the broader metaphoric tension in the text between visibility (hence knowledge and power) and hiding (hence power shifts and spiritual renewal).\n\n• Upon her disappearance, Nāmakaokapāo'o returns to the house they had shared with Pualiʻi and lives there alone, laying claim to the space. This act of reclamation is both physical and symbolic:\n– His climbing on top of the house (*piʻi aʻela i luna o kaupoku o ka hale*) can be interpreted as an assertion of dominance over the space.\n– By *wehe aʻela i ka mauʻu o ke kua a me ke alo* (tearing off the thatch from the back and front), he completes a symbolic purge of the prior domestic configuration. Thatching was sacred work (*ʻaʻa ina hale*), often performed with rituals to ensure prosperity and family continuity.\n\n• Nāmakaokapāo'o lies in the center of the roof. This act is significant:\n– In traditional Hawaiian cosmology, the thatched roof served as a symbolic boundary between the earthly (*honua*) and the divine (*lani*). By lying upon the roof, he straddles that liminal space.\n– He repositions himself as the spiritual and physical center of the household, replacing not only Pualiʻi but even the absent father-figure (*hānau ia kona ʻaikāne ‘ana makemake ʻoe iaʻu* in earlier parts of the narrative).\n– This may symbolize an allegorical break from the *ʻAi Kapu* tradition of male-dominated priestly lineages—here, a young male figure places himself as the axis of the domestic world not through inherited rank, but through raw presence and willfulness. This could be read as a critique of the old order and the reimagining of a new one centered on individual power rather than inherited status.\n\n• The young boy’s actions—while outwardly rebellious and antisocial—mirror the symbolic actions of deities and culture heroes in oral traditions. In taking charge of the house, he demonstrates metaphorical maturity far beyond his years and emerges as an *oʻo* or staff figure—a living symbol of authority and potential resurrection of ancient power (*mana hanale* might apply here).\n\n• Note also the poetic resonance of *luna o ke kaupoku*—on the edge of the house’s roof—as a liminal positioning: the *kaupoku* (edge, brink) being a place of transition, representing possibly the boy’s own betwixt-and-between state as a god-child and a man-child, as he moves between childhood and a supernatural manifestation of divine justice.\n\n– This aligns with earlier character cues where he was born under divine circumstances (*he 'ao'ao akua kekahi ona*) and has already demonstrated superhuman strength and defiance.\n</Commentary>",

Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
