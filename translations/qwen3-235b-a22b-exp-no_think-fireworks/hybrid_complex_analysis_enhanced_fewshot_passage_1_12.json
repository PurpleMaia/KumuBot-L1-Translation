  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nThen 'Ama'u, the chief from Waikīkī, sent four warriors, among whom was a man eight feet tall, and all four were similarly tall.

It introduces warfare as a central motif, showing that word of Nāmakaokapāo'o's deeds has already reached Waikīkī, a historically prominent region on O'ahu associated with powerful ali‘i (chiefs) and significant cultural practices.  \n• 'Ama'u: **ʻA-maʻu** (the silent or the hidden one / the tranquil), possibly referring to a certain mysteriousness or stealthiness in demeanor befitting a chief. The name may also suggest the fern *mau* (dry land fern), used metaphorically for someone who stands firm and unyielding. 'Ama'u is from Waikīkī (Wai-kī-kī: \"spilling waters,\" referring to the abundant springs and waterways of this area). His role as a chief delegating warriors suggests a hierarchical military structure typical of pre-‘Ai Kapu Hawaiian warfare.  \n• The composition of the warriors—\"**ehā po'e kaua, aia ma ka po’e ho’okahi he kanahā kumamāwalu kānaka ka nui**\"—introduces yet another numeric riddle: the group of four includes one particularly large warrior (\"eight feet tall\"), suggesting that the numerical references in this story are not literal, but symbolic. This use of numbers may function as a kaona (\"hidden meaning\") tied to mana (spiritual power) and transformation, possibly aligning with kapu-breaking or deification themes common in moʻolelo Hawaiʻi.  \n• The warriors travel to **Ke-a-hu-moa** (the moa heap, or chicken heap, depending on source) and enter the house expecting to find Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. This environment establishes a setting where domestic space is implicated in martial conflict, which aligns with practices from the **pre-ʻAi Kapu era**, where familial and political tensions often culminated in confrontations—even within the home. The lack of a visible inhabitant in the house is a deliberate dramatic device, emphasizing Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s command of space and perception—symbolically positioning him above others even before the confrontation begins.\n– The phrase **\"komolīna hoi aku la ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o i luna o kaʻupokū\"** invites spatial and metaphoric analysis. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o speaks from \"the roof\" (*kaʻupoku*), placing him in a superior spiritual and physical position both literally and symbolically. In traditional Hawaiian architecture, the house (hale) represents the body, and the roof or ridgepole (ʻiʻoko) is representative of ancestral lineage and spiritual consciousness (HIN, Traditional Hale Studies). This placement suggests that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o commands ancestral power and spiritual insight, contrasting the worldly strength of the Waikīkī warriors.\n• The warriors are confused by the voice but not the sight—hearing but not seeing the body. This echoes older mythological themes where the true hero or akua (god/s) reveals themselves only visually after establishing dominance verbally. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s use of voice before being seen suggests divine or semi-divine status. Similar to how Kāne or Lono might announce their presence before manifesting, the verbal assertion of identity (\"Eia nō wau i luna nei\") resonates with chants used in traditional Hawaiian rituals—especially those performed on heiau (temples).  \n• The warriors then climb to confront him, dividing evenly (four behind the house, four at the front), indicating a belief in the necessity of surrounding and controlling all exits—perhaps an old **ʻōʻō kaua** (war tactics) method of the time, common before muskets and modern weaponry. The number 8 recurs in this confrontation (eight men climbing)—suggesting a symbolic threshold or rite of passage, perhaps echoing the kāhiko (ancient), pre-missionary worldview which favored specific numerological patterns for ritual resonance.  \n• The warriors reveal they were not simply hunting Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o for glory, but because he had already committed the ultimate symbolic act by **killing his stepfather**. This alludes to a break with ancestral protocols: in traditional Hawaiian society, a stepfather occupies a position of authority, and his death by a child's hand marks a profound disruption in the **kuleana** (duties, responsibilities) and **kapu** (sacred laws), especially those under the **ʻAi Kapu** system concerning familial respect and hierarchy.\n– The warriors, sent by a Waikīkī ruler, may be attempting to enact **hūnāwali** (punishment or vendetta), a practice in pre-unified Hawaiʻi where chiefs acted as arbiters of justice and often dispatched warriors to eliminate threats or enforce retribution for disruptive acts. However, the narrative frames them as ignorant outsiders underestimating the symbolic import of the boy—they call him “a child like you,” believing Nāmakaokapāo'o to be a juvenile delinquent, rather than the divine agent he represents.  \n• From a mythopoetic perspective, the warriors from Waikīkī may embody the remnants of the old **ʻAi Kapu order**, while Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, still living in the Keahumoa plains, reflects a new era marked by defiance of traditional limits, particularly those associated with divine punishment and retribution. This portion sets the stage for an eschatological confrontation between old ritual norms and a rising paradigm of personal agency and transformation.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
