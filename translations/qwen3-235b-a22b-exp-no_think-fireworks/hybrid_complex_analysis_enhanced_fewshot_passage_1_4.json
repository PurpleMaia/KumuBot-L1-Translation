  "qwen3-235b-a22b-exp-no_think-fireworks_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o resided there and cultivated food; his two large sweet potato patches had remained until this day, and the names of these patches had come to be known as Nāmakaokapāo'o until this time. As he was planting the sweet potatoes, Puali‘i spoke his incantation, saying, \"Behold, now the head of the ulua and the sweet potato are united; let Puali‘i eat first, and then the noa may eat, his wife Pōkā‘ī and the other items. Therefore, Puali‘i descended to the coast of Honouliuli to fish in the sea along with the sweet potato harvest.\"",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-exp-no_think-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 4 Commentary:**\n\n• This paragraph describes Nāmakaokapāo'o’s settlement and agricultural activity, emphasizing the enduring nature of his labor as symbolized by his two large, named sweet potato patches. Their continued existence \"until this day\" suggests a tradition of ancestral land stewardship and the association of these plots with his name speaks to the practice of *kūkā o wahi*—marking or naming land in accordance with deeds, lineage, or significance. \n\n– *Mahilo āna māla ‘uala lō‘ihi*: The repetition and significance of the number two (the two māla, the two parents, the duality of god and man) suggests a deeper mythic structure. Sweet potato (*ʻuala*) is sacred in Hawaiian cosmology, often associated with *ʻāina* (land) and *nahele* (forest), and is also linked to deities like Lono. The planting of ʻuala often included *ho'okupu* and *kāli*, rites of first fruits and blessings to Lonoikamakahiki, god of fertility and peace.  \n– *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo* (\"the eyes of the pāoʻo fish\"): Again, the name integrates *maka* (\"eye\") which is highly symbolic in Hawaiian worldview, representing mana (spiritual power) and intelligence. The “pāoʻo” (rock-mullet or small fish) also carries sacred symbolism since fish were often intermediaries between humans and gods in Hawaiian thought, particularly in substitutions of human for divine offerings (e.g., *ulua* for *poʻo*). The substitution of fish for human sacrifice is revisited below in Pualiʻi’s incantation.\n\n• The incantation spoken by Pualiʻi while planting ʻuala is of deep cultural interest:  \n– *“Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ʻuala, a ʻai ‘o Pualiʻi, a laila, noa, ʻai kāna wahine…”*  \n• This passage is rich in symbolic ritual language, particularly within the context of the *'Ai Kapu* system. Pualiʻi places himself within a sacred framework by claiming first rights to eat after the planting—before *noa* categories (common people), including his wife and possessions.\n\n– The pairing of *ke poʻo o ka ulua me ka ʻuala* (\"the head of the ulua and the sweet potato\") is a metaphor that inverts the traditional religious practice. The head of the ulua was typically presented to the aliʻi or placed on the altar as part of the *hoʻokupu*, especially in times when human sacrifice was ritually substituted with ulua to feed Lono at the *heiau*. Here, the ʻuala (a symbol of the commoner and human sustenance) is joined with the head of the fish in a sort of pairing of sustenance – food for gods, food for humans – yet Pualiʻi consumes first, before his wife and the *noa*, indicating his claim to inherited authority.\n\n• Pualiʻi then returns to Honouliuli to fish with intent to eat it together with ʻuala, echoing the structure of offerings from sea and land. This mirrors the ritualistic pairing of *he aloha ‘āina, he aloha kai* (love of the land, love of the sea) – a common reframing of sustenance in Hawaiian chants and narratives.\n\n– *Honouliuli* (literally: \"dark bay\") is not just a geographic setting but symbolically tied to darkness, mystery, and the liminality of cultural transformation. It is also the namesake of a WWII-era internment camp for Japanese Americans in Oʻahu, showing continuity of layered cultural meanings in place naming.\n\n– It is likely that this passage sets up an allegorical tension between the old ways of 'Ai Kapu (with Pualiʻi expressing a desire to consume according to traditional hierarchy and sacrificial substitution) and the new era (emerging through Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s defiance against control and ritual constraint, to be revealed in later passages). This tension may represent a metaphor for transitional phases of Hawaiian religious and social transformation.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
