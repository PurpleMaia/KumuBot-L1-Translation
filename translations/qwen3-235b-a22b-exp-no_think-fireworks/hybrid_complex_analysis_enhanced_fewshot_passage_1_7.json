All the children saw him coming and ran quickly, fleeing to a distance out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey! Here is the knife in my hand—it is for cutting off your head today, sever your head and roast it with sweet potatoes so that I may eat before, and then you will be done for.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not respond to Puali‘i’s words. Then Puali‘i spoke a second time. Puali‘i prepared his knife to cut off Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head. At that moment, Nāmakaokapāo‘o began to chant his death chant for Puali‘i. He sang thus:\n\nAloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o,  \nE hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei,  \nE ‘ai paha, e waiho paha,  \nE waiho paha Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,  \n‘O Kukui‘aimakaokalani kēlā,  \n‘O ku‘u wahi aikāne kēia,  \n‘O Nāmakaokai‘a ke ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i,  \nE he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale,  \n‘O kānaka nō me ka ihe,  \n‘O ka ihe nō me ka pahu,  \nMake nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-exp-no_think-fireworks_commentary": "**  \n**Paragraph 7:**  \n• This passage is pivotal in the narrative for depicting a dramatic confrontation between two central figures—Puali‘i, the stepfather, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, the semi-divine child of a chief and a goddess/demigoddess. Notably, it juxtaposes a violent, human-driven act with a ritualistic, poetic response that is emblematic of Hawaiian oral traditions: a *pule make*, or death chant. The passage also illustrates the broader cosmological tension between the old order (and its violent dictates) and the divine child who represents transformation and new authority.\n\n**Characters and Cultural Contexts:**  \n• *Puali‘i* (perhaps “child of the chief”)—here depicted as a man of decisive, ferocious momentum and intent. His grabbing of a knife (ko‘ilipi < *ko‘i*, knife, and possibly *‘līpī*, a variant of *‘ilipi*, French for “razor”) suggests he is under intense emotional influence. His actions signal a regression into older rituals of violence and perhaps blood sacrifice, in contrast to the rising power of the demigod Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  \n– The mention that all the other children flee out of fear (*maka‘u*) indicates that Puali‘i is not simply a local man, but a figure of social authority, perhaps even a *kāula* or priest-like figure capable of wielding divine wrath as a weapon. In cultural context, this echoes the *āio* tradition—unpredictable figures in Hawaiian mythology who could be either mentors or threats depending on their *mana* and mood.  \n\n• *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (The Eyes of the pāo‘o fish) is of deep spiritual lineage and cosmic identity. His act of roasting the *‘au ‘uala* (sweet potato vines) is symbolic and ritualistic. It suggests a rejection of the normative hierarchy of food consumption, particularly in the *'Ai Kapu* era where root foods such as *'uala* were allowed for men and women to eat together only at certain times.  \n– To roast the vine instead of the tuber (the part usually food) is potentially subversive—it may reflect an inversion of traditional practices and possibly a foreshadowing that the *'Ai Kapu* era is nearing its end, catalyzed by beings such as him who combine both divine and royal status. His four sweet potatoes thus might hold ritual number significance.\n\n• The chant itself is of immense mythological, linguistic, and ritualistic importance. It is a *pule make*—a poetic incantation spoken at the time of death or impending doom. The lines are replete with symbolic metaphors and allude to Hawaiian cosmology, including relationships among deities and ancestral forces. Below is a line-by-line analysis:\n\n– **“Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o”**:  \nThis begins with a paradox: even as someone is trying to kill him, the speaker offers *aloha*, love or farewell—it could mean both. The *maka*, or eyes, of *wahi pāo‘o* (my pāo‘o fish) signal the identity of the speaker (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o), whose vision or spiritual sight already sees the reversal of roles—for though he may appear as an innocent child being threatened, his chant forecasts the death of the attacker. This line could be read as an oracle invoking the *mana* of the fish *pāo‘o*, known in Hawaiian mythology as a keen-eyed creature tied with deep seeing and spiritual navigation underwater. This connects with the lineage of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, possibly (and literally) being a child with oceanic and seer-like divine ancestry.\n\n– **“E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei”**:  \nThis line suggests a cosmic convulsion or spiritual earthquake—the rising of divine wrath. The *hapupu‘u* is a rising in tumult. *Hāpāpa‘a*, perhaps related to *pāpa‘a*, solid or firm, could imply that the divine force is now being unleashed with full force against the mortal attacker. These are not words of fear, but rather of an invocation of divine counteraction.\n\n– **“E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha / E waiho paha Nākukui‘aimakaokalani”**:  \nThese lines may reference the *kukui* torch or the concept of illumination. *Nākukui*‘aimakaokalani possibly refers to eyes that see in the dark, or a diadem of light that looks upon the attacker. The use of *waiho* (to leave behind, abandon, dedicate) implies ritual sacrifice—not of himself, but of the aggressor, Puali‘i.\n\n– **“‘O Kukui‘aimakaokalani kēlā, / ‘O ku‘u wahi aikāne kēia”**:   \nKukui‘aimakaokalani could refer to a divine ancestral figure. The term *aikāne* is a deep and ambiguous term in Hawaiian; most scholars concur that it can indicate a very close male companion, whether emotional, spiritual, or even intimate. The line suggests that Nāmakaokapāo‘o is invoking a divine beloved or spirit guard in the plural, possibly Kanaloa or other ocean guardians linked to Namaka’s lineage.  \n\n– **“‘O Nāmakaokai‘a ke ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i”**:  \nThis is a clear claim of royalty. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o identifies himself as a great chief of Hawai‘i (Nāmakaokai‘a = perhaps “The Sea-Eyed One”). This establishes his ultimate authority and divine claim to power. The change from *Nāmakaokapāo‘o (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish)* in the line before to *Nāmakaokai‘a (the eyes of the ocean)* now is deeply symbolic—it indicates that he has shifted identity from a local fish spirit to a broader, cosmic oceanic deity, aligning with the major deity Namaka (Nā-maka-o-kāne), the sister of Pele, who rose from Molokini Crater.  \n\n– **“E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale, / ‘O kānaka nō me ka ihe, / ‘O ka ihe nō me ka pahu, / Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”**  \nIn this section, the chant closes with dramatic imagery of battle inversion and reversal of fate.  \n– *He‘e*—to slide, to escape, to flee—echoes here. The repetition “e he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē” suggests an accelerating motion of retreat—for Puali‘i, not the child.  \n– The last couplet speaks of reversal (*kanaka me ka ihe, ihe me ka pahu*—the man vs. the spear, the spear vs. the drum) which is poetic code for the interchange of the mortal and the divine in a cosmic confrontation. The drum (*pahu*) is a sacred instrument in Hawaiian belief, often used to attract divine attention (used at *heiau*, in hula, in war ceremonies). Here, the spear becomes powerless in the face of divine rhythm and song.  \n– The final line *Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o* is not a final plea for death but a ritual sealing of fate — in the mouth of the child, this line becomes a prophecy. It’s as though he has announced that *kāu make* (your death) is happening now, not mine.\n\n**Cultural Symbolism and Allegory:**\n• Puali‘i represents the last vestiges or echoes of *'Ai Kapu* law, the violent dominion of men, the use of weapons and sacrifice to retain masculine authority. He wants to consume the child along with the ‘uala and ‘au ‘uala, echoing the old custom of ritual sacrifice using vegetable and animal (or human) substitutes. The inclusion of head and eyes in the execution motif reflects the act of *'ai kapu*, or consuming the essence of another for spiritual power.\n• Nāmakaokapāo‘o, however, is the child of both a *kanaka ali‘i* (royal man) Kauluakaha‘i, and a woman/spirit/woman with divinity (possibly an *ʻaumākua*) in Pōka‘ī. The name *Pō-ka-ʻi* could mean “Night Falls Upon the Chief” or “Night Embellished One”—suggestive of nobility, mystery, perhaps even connection to the feminine lunar god Hanaila in some interpretations.  \n– Given this parentage, and his own oceanic name (*pāo‘o* linked to seerlike fish and the ocean), Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a liminal figure akin to Namaka in Hawaiian cosmology, representing a coming age—one that transcends *'Ai Kapu*, shifts cultural norms, and calls forth the collective strength of divine ancestors (through the *pule make*).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis passage is a turning point in the story—not only for its depiction of violence and inevitability of death, but for its literary and cosmological depth. The *pule make* signifies more than a child’s lament or shielded defiance—it is an invocation of ancestral powers and a ritual death chant that, in the act of seeming humiliation or execution, enacts the metaphysical reversal of power. The child Nāmakaokapāo‘o, even in mortal danger, takes control by calling upon the *na‘ao* (intuitive knowledge), the oceanic ancestry, and the sacred poetic form to transcend the violence of the age. This scene functions as both a mythic initiation and a prophecy—heralding the emergence of a new cosmological and cultural phase.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
