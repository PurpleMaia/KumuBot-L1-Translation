  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nWhen 'Ama'u heard of this, he prepared his war canoes, all eighteen of them, and sailed down to 'Ewa to do battle with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u and his people arrived in 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o had already destroyed everyone utterly; none remained, and so 'Ama'u was slain. Thus the whole of O'ahu came under the power of Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then he took his mother and placed her to dwell upon the land of O'ahu.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 14:**  \n• This passage concludes the military campaign of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (the eyes of the pāoʻo fish) against the invading forces of ʻA-maʻu (the “twisted” or “curled” one, perhaps alluding to cunning, coiled intentions, or deceptive maneuvers in warfare), and marks the full consolidation of Nāmakaokapāo'o's dominion over the island of O'ahu.  \n– The use of the term *hoʻomākaukau* (to prepare, make ready) implies a ritual and strategic preparation for war, which in the pre-contact Hawaiian context would have included consultation with *kāula* (prophets), offerings at *heiau*, and the recitation of *oli noʻeau* (expert ceremonial chants) to secure divine favor and battle-readiness (*hoʻomanawa*).  \n• The mention of *kumamāwalu* (eighteen) war canoes is significant. The number eighteen does not appear to be symbolic in the same way as other numbers in Hawaiian tradition (e.g., 4, 7, 8, 13), but its precise use here likely reflects a cultural record of the tangible military strength of 'Ama'u's forces, perhaps denoting a substantial and well-coordinated invasion force.  \n– Eighteen war canoes would have carried a significant number of warriors, at least a dozen or more per canoe if tradition holds, and would indicate an organized campaign rather than a mere skirmish.  \n• The battle occurs in *ʻEwa*, a traditional district known for its strategic position on the southern part of Oʻahu. 'Ewa was historically associated with warfare and battle-readiness, being the site of many significant encounters and home to the famed *heiau* of Kaʻena and Manoa, both centers of spiritual and military power.  \n– The name ʻEwa itself is said to derive from the story of Pele’s sister, Hiʻiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele, who traveled from the windward side of the island to the leeward side and found it less fertile, thus calling it *ʻEwa* – “crooked” or “uneven.” This fits the theme of tension between opposing forces in this narrative.  \n• That Nāmakaokapāo'o had already *luku ā pau loa*—completely destroyed—his enemies implies not only military supremacy but also a thematic trope found in moʻolelo Hawaiʻi: the *unihipili kānā* (avenger) motif, where the protagonist exacts justice or dominance over a region.  \n– This destruction is complete and final: *ʻaʻole kanaka koe*, meaning none were spared. This could signal not just military victory, but a symbolic cleansing or resetting of power dynamics on the island.  \n• ʻAmaʻu’s death serves as a climactic turning point: he is killed upon arrival, illustrating the overwhelming nature of Nāmakaokapāoʻo's power, and emphasizing that no opposition could survive despite preparation.  \n• The phrase *puni aʻela o Oʻahu nei iā Nāmakaokapāoʻo* signifies total conquest and rule over the island. This is a *hōʻāinakō* (unification under one rule), often seen in the rise of ruling chiefs like ʻUmi-a-Līloa or even later historical figures such as Kamehameha I.  \n– It should be noted that control of Oʻahu by a single chief is a rare motif in this early period, implying a pre-unification of the island under Nāmakaokapāoʻo, a character often associated with *nānā pākī* (watchful eyes) and kānā (vindictiveness or just avengement), alluding to protective yet aggressive rulership.  \n• The final act of taking his mother and placing her *i luna o ka ʻāina Oʻahu* (atop the land of Oʻahu) is both a literal and symbolic act:  \n– Literally, it places her in a position of honor and safety, possibly on one of the highlands of Oʻahu like Lāʻie or Kāneʻohe, where royal families often resided for spiritual, health, and defensive reasons.  \n– Symbolically, this is a *puʻuhonua* gesture—establishing a peace through strength and reaffirming the matrilineal reverence central to Hawaiian leadership. The mother is elevated through the son’s accomplishments, and the land is sanctified under the presence of a *wahine aliʻi* (chiefly woman), reinforcing *mana wahine* (female sacred power).  \n• Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions reflect an earlier Hawaiian heroic ideal: strong, impulsive, and deeply familial. While later unifiers like Kamehameha governed with a more centralized and diplomatic model, Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s rule is one of battlefield dominance followed by symbolic elevation of bloodline legitimacy.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
