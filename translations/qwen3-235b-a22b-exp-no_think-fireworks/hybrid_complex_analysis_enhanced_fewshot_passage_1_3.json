  "qwen3-235b-a22b-exp-no_think-fireworks_translation": "The two were going about their lives when Puali‘i, a good man from Līhu‘e, came down from the uplands to fish at the shore of Honouliuli. He visited the home of Pōka‘i and, having seen her, fell in love with her. He said to her, \"I desire you to be my wife.\" Pōka‘i replied, \"How could you ever want me? I have already borne a child, and my body is no longer as it was.\" Puali‘i replied, \"Those things are of no consequence. If you desire me, then let us lie together as husband and wife.\" Pōka‘i agreed, and went off with her new husband Puali‘i to live in the plains of Keahumoa.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-exp-no_think-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**\n\n• A new character is introduced: **Pua-li‘i (child/descendant of a chief or of chiefs)**, described as a \"good man\" (*kanaka maika‘i*) from Līhu‘e — a district located inland of Wāhiāwā on the island of O‘ahu. His name, Pua-li‘i, may be interpreted as \"*flower (or child) of the chief*,\" signifying noble lineage or qualities. As will be confirmed later in the tale, he is a man of character, strength, and resolve. He is described as coming from the inland (*no Līhu‘e*) and arriving by the shore (*ma kai o Honouliuli*), which is likely Honouliuli in the district of ‘Ewa on O‘ahu — a historically and culturally significant coastal region. This location connects him to the land and sea, and in Hawaiian tradition, those who traverse both regions — *ma uka a ma kai* — are considered balanced (*pono*) and often protagonists of significant tales.\n\n– The first movement of Pua-li‘i brings him to the shore (*ka lawai‘a ma kai*) — likely fishing, though the word “lawai‘a” can imply a broader purpose, including exploration of the coast as a kanaka maika‘i (virtuous and capable man). The fact that he “visits the house” (*kipa maila*) of Pōka‘i is consistent with ancient Hawaiian customs: In the **pre-contact period**, it was customary for travelers to visit homes of locals for food, water, and shelter, and it was considered both *pono* and a display of hospitality (*aloha*) to provide such. Pōka‘i receiving Pua-li‘i in her home aligns with this traditional value, and it is in this natural, everyday setting that the seeds of love are sown.\n\n• The verb “nānā” (to look at, to examine, to regard with interest) is significant in this context. When Pua-li‘i “nānā akula iā Pōka‘i,” it suggests more than a glance; it is an act of *recognition* — potentially mystical or fate-driven. In many mo‘olelo Hawai‘i (Hawaiian narratives), seeing someone and being moved to love is not merely romantic impulse, but a narrative device indicating divine or ancestral intervention in human affairs. The use of **makemake** (to desire, to love) that follows is direct and unwavering: he expresses his desire for Pōka‘i to be his *wahine* (wife, lover, long-term companion). This expression is immediate, not gradual, another motif commonly found in *mo‘olelo* where attraction and decision occur in rapid succession, symbolizing certainty and destiny.\n\n• Pōka‘i responds with self-doubt and self-deprecation, citing two clear reasons: (1) she has already given birth to a child (Nāmakaokapāo‘o), and (2) her body is “no longer as it was” (*ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino*), implying that childbirth has changed her physical form, perhaps post-partum scarring, weight loss or gain, or other markers of motherhood. This self-characterization stands in contrast to the usual idealized portrayals of female beauty in *mo‘olelo Hawai‘i*, where heroines like Pele, Namaka, or Hi‘iaka are often described as *na mōhinu o ka lani*, the heavenly beauties of the sky. Pōka‘i's words are humble and revealing of **postpartum self-perception** in traditional society — a psychological nuance that is often underrepresented in high epic tales.\n\n– Puali‘i’s counter — “He mea ‘ole ia mau mea” — affirms that status as a mother does not devalue her in his eyes. It also emphasizes the **non-physical dimensions of desire** in relationships, which extends beyond kānaka to include *aloha ‘āina* (love of land) and *aloha akua* (love of gods/ancestors). The phrase “e moe kāua” (“let us lie together”) is a clear sexual proposition in polite, yet culturally appropriate, language. In older *moʻolelo*, “e moe” functions both literally and metaphorically — sometimes describing union, sometimes a spiritual unification or binding of destinies.\n\n• Their union is not immediately accepted by the community, as will be revealed in later chapters, which heightens the narrative tension. However, in this passage, the immediate outcome is her assent: “ʻAe akula ‘o Pōka‘i.” She chooses to go with Pua-li‘i to Keahumoa (*Ke-ahu moa*, possibly meaning \"the heap (or gathering) of the chicken\") — a place-name with likely symbolic resonance. Some scholars suggest Keahumoa refers to a stretch of land in the Waikele or Waiawa regions of central O‘ahu, near Wāhiāwā.\n\n– The relocation to Keahumoa marks a **transition** — Pōka‘i leaves her past with Nāmakaokapāo‘o behind and aligns her fate with Pua-li‘i’s. Migration or movement to a new area is common in Hawaiian storytelling, often signifying a pivotal life choice or a shift in social status.\n\n– Given the cultural weight of movement (*ho‘i aku*), especially for women, and the implications of shifting allegiance (*aloha kāne*) from one man to another — especially in an *ʻAi Kapu* society — this narrative moment likely carries **symbolic cultural tensions**. It may be interpreted as a **subversion** or **challenge** to rigid ‘Ai Kapu ideologies that regulated gender roles and sexual relationships, particularly post-partum. By accepting Pua-li‘i, Pōka‘i exercises agency and affirms the right of women to claim sovereignty over their own lives and desires.\n\n• Etymologically, the name **Pō-ka‘i** — literally “night has journeyed” — captures the notion of passage through time, solitude (pō = night, darkness), and spiritual journeying. She is a figure of quiet strength, emerging from emotional and physical solitude into a new life with Pua-li‘i. Her choice represents **transformation**, and her character arc may serve as an allegory for broader post-Ai Kapu societal changes — that is, integration of the old (*pō*) with the new (*ka‘i* = to lead, to journey forward).\n\n– This early episode in the story also supports what appears to be a thematic **antagonism** yet to be fully revealed between Pua-li‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o — who will grow to despise his stepfather, eventually embodying chaos and danger in contrast to Pua-li‘i’s order and masculinity. Their conflict may echo broader mythological dichotomies such as **Kāne vs. Kanaloa**, or **Pākā vs. Kāne**, where the cosmic battle between order and chaos plays out through human or divine figures.",

He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
