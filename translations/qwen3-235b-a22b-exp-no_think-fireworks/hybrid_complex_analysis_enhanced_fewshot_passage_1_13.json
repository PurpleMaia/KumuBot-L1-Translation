Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nNāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I see it clearly, I am truly a great person, Nāmakaokapāo'o, who has gone to Ko'olau, and my name is his name.\" They replied, \"No, it's you, as we have heard, and therefore, you must die by our hands; you will not live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Let's go back down below to wrestle.\" When they went below, Nāmakaokapāo'o fought them and killed them all, except one person who ran away to find 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told 'Ama'u of their complete deaths, and he was the one who went to inform 'Ama'u.\n</translation>\n\n– Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o confidently proclaims his identity, asserting that he is a great person (kanaka nui) and that his name is the same as someone important (likely a powerful figure he emulates or embodies, such as a mythic ancestor). He invites his challengers to go down and wrestle (hakakā), perhaps to prove his strength or resolve their challenge in a traditional way. Upon returning, he defeats all of them in combat, except one who escapes to Waikīkī (a well-known place of royal residence and important political center in ancient O'ahu) to report the deaths to someone named 'Ama'u (possibly a chief or leader who was expecting the group's return).\n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 13 – Commentary:**\n\n• This passage continues the narrative surrounding Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s extraordinary strength and bold defiance against those who doubt or challenge his abilities. His self-identification as ʻkanaka nui nōʻ suggests not only his confidence but also a declaration of mana (spiritual power and status) that aligns with traditional Hawaiian expressions of identity tied closely to name, lineage, and deeds. The phrase \"he kanaka nui nō 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o\" serves to affirm his socio-political standing as a powerful figure.  \n• The confrontation demonstrates the traditional Hawaiian practice of hakakā (to wrestle), a valued skill often showcased by young warriors or aliʻi in proving their strength and training. The invitation by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o to return \"i lalo e hakakā ai\" (down below to wrestle) is significant—it may suggest ritualistic engagement in combat or mimicry of formal challenge practices where physical contests were used to resolve disputes. \n• The opponents' reply is hostile and fatalistic: they declare that death awaits him \"no laila, e make ana 'oe iā mākou, 'a'ole 'oe e ola.\" This implies they may believe he is a false claimant or a threat to their lineage or standing. The language used here is evocative of the tensions in aliʻi society, where name ownership and genealogical legitimacy could result in conflict or even death.  \n• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s triumph over his attackers—with only one escaping—emphasizes his superior strength and reinforces the earlier motif in the text of Nāmakaokapāo'o as a demi-god-like figure who overcomes human and supernatural adversaries alike.  \n• The fleeing survivor's journey to find 'Amaʻu in Waikīkī suggests that the narrative is connected to or has implications for the high chiefly circles of Oʻahu. Waikīkī was a prominent seat of aliʻi including Kalaniʻōpuʻu and others, and perhaps 'Amaʻu was a significant chief connected to this lineage or political power structure. The use of Waikīkī as a location where the news of this battle arrives highlights the geographical and political importance of Oʻahu in ancestral Hawaiian narratives.  \n• 'Amaʻu’s name may also carry connotative meaning—'A-ma'u (the one who ascends at night)—possibly symbolizing someone who operates in secrecy or shadows, rising at odd times, perhaps a sorcerer, guardian, or political agent.  \n• The narrative structure here is typical of heroic myths: a claim of identity or right is made, met with opposition and danger; victory is achieved through strength or divine favor; a survivor spreads news of the outcome, setting up future events or broader implications for the hero.  \n– This passage embodies cultural values around contest, honor, and lineage recognition in pre-contact Hawaiian society, where name and mana were deeply interwoven and often challenged. Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions, though violent, align with the narrative tropes of indigenous heroism where physical prowess, spiritual status, and genealogical boasting are key elements.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
