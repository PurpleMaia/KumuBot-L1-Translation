At that time, ‘Ama‘u was ruling as chief of O‘ahu and was living in Waikīkī, when a man came all the way from Honouliuli to Waikīkī where the chief was staying. The man said: “O chief!

It marks the first time it is specifically stated that Nāmakaokapāo‘o does not eat food—likely pointing to his supernatural nature, and perhaps alluding to his part-god origins (“he 'ao'ao akua” from earlier passages).\n\n– The lack of need for sustenance is a common trait of kāula (prophets), akua (gods), and 'aumākua (ancestral spirits), and may indicate that Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a supernatural figure or represents a mythic archetype whose strength is derived from divine or ancestral powers.\n\n• The narrative shifts focus to the island of O‘ahu where 'Ama'u, a high chief (ali‘i), is living in Waikīkī. A messenger travels a long distance from Honouliuli ('Ewa, O‘ahu) to Waikīkī specifically to report news of Nāmakaokapāo‘o's strength to the ali‘i.\n– Travel in ancient Hawai‘i was done entirely on foot or by canoe. A journey from Honouliuli to Waikīkī would likely take several hours to a full day, suggesting the importance of the message and the urgency or intrigue surrounding Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s strength.\n\n• The messenger describes Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o as “he keiki 'u'uku ikaika loa”—“a very small but extremely strong child”— reinforcing the paradox central to this character: small in physique (like a demigod or god) yet immensely powerful. The theme of paradox and spiritual power hidden within a small frame continues.\n\n– This motif is echoed in the legendary figure of Kāneapua, another demigod or shape-shifter known for immense strength yet childlike appearance, and often associated with Pele and water (Pukui: Mary Kawena Pukui, \"The Polynesian Family System in Ka'ū, Hawai‘i\").\n\n• The mention that “ua make kona makua kāne a ua kiola ‘ia kona po'o i kai loa, he wahi lō‘ihi loa, ‘elima mile ka lō‘ihi” (“his father has died and his father's head was carried a very long distance into the sea—five miles long”) serves as a flashback but is likely symbolic rather than literal.\n\n– The “father’s head being carried five miles into the sea” may symbolize either the death of a major chief or priest whose spiritual power was still present, and which now resides in the son, Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Alternatively, it alludes to the burial customs of the 'Ai Kapu era, where the bones of high chiefs were often taken to sacred sea burials to preserve their mana.\n\n– The five-mile sea journey may be symbolic of the spiritual distance between the world of the living and the realm of ancestors or gods. It is far enough to indicate a complete passage into the sacred space, yet consistent with tales of mariners who could travel such distances off O‘ahu’s southern shores.\n\n• The messenger further states that “if ‘Ama‘u hears this, he will desire to fight the child and he will kill the child, but I will not kill the child—for there is no one like him in strength.” This creates anticipation and stakes in the plot, and also demonstrates cultural attitudes toward strength, warfare, and mana.\n\n– In traditional Hawaiian thought, mana (spiritual power) often resided in ali‘i by birth right and could be challenged by those with greater strength or divine favor. If Nāmakaokapāo‘o had the strength to challenge or defeat a high chief like ‘Ama‘u, it would imply that he either possessed greater mana or was being used as a kāula or 'aumākua to enact divine justice or retribution.\n\n• The closing clause confirms that Nāmakaokapāo‘o himself overheard the message spoken of him in Waikīkī, suggesting his supernatural reach or presence extended beyond his physical space. It also foreshadows the boy’s impending confrontation with the ruling chief of O‘ahu.\n\n– The act of overhearing an insult, challenge, or call to action is a frequent narrative device in traditional mo‘olelo, where the hero responds to a challenge even if not personally delivered.\n\n– This moment marks the beginning of the larger narrative arc in which Nāmakaokapāo‘o must confront not just Puali‘i, but a true ali‘i—raising the stakes and situating this particular mo‘olelo within a genre of hero narratives that pit young demi-gods against established chiefs, often with revolutionary or symbolic implications.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
