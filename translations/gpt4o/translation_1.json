  "gpt4o_translation": "<translation>Due to Pikoiakaalala's extreme hunger, he slipped away from the crowd and returned to his sisters, where the pig and food were cooked. Before eating, Pikoiakaalala said, \"Listen all of you, I have a rule for eating, which is: 'No talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching, no murmuring, until I have finished eating.'\" He grabbed the pig, one bite, the sweet potato poi, one swallow, and gulped it down, grabbing again, nearly finishing the entire pig and all the food from the oven. Someone remarked, \"Food for the gods.\" That was the end of it. The brothers-in-law said, \"Are you going to stop eating now?\" \"No, I am indeed satisfied.\" \"Yes, we heard your rule,\" said the brothers-in-law. From this meal of Pikoiakaalala, his body grew and became large and handsome, but his hair remained like rat hair.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair."
