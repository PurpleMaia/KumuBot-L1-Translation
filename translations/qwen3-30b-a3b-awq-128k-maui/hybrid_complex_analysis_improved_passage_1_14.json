  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "A place of 'Ama'u, he carefully tended those canoes, the chief's lineage, the lineage of the sea. And they descended to the lower part of Ewa with Nāmakaokapāo'o. A hula (dance) of 'Ama'u with his people in Ewa, to be a refuge for Nāmakaokapāo'o in the deep ocean. No one is you, and the chief is lost to 'Ama'u. This is also the O'ahu of Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then, they painted on her mother, and placed a mark on the land of O'ahu here.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>A place of 'Ama'u, he carefully tended those canoes, the chief's lineage, the lineage of the sea. And they descended to the lower part of Ewa with Nāmakaokapāo'o. A hula (dance) of 'Ama'u with his people in Ewa, to be a refuge for Nāmakaokapāo'o in the deep ocean. No one is you, and the chief is lost to 'Ama'u. This is also the O'ahu of Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then, they painted on her mother, and placed a mark on the land of O'ahu here.</translation>\n\n<commentary>  \n• The passage reflects a transition from traditional Hawaiian cosmology to post-contact social upheaval, symbolizing the erosion of pre-contact kapu systems and the disruption of ancestral knowledge.  \n  – The phrase \"kaua me Nāmakaokapāo'o\" (with Nāmakaokapāo'o) alludes to the \"Ai Kapu\" era, where sacred taboos governed resource management and social order.  \n  – \"Ho'omākaukau\" (carefully tended) and \"kumamāwalu\" (lineage of the sea) evoke the sacred duty of chiefs to sustain the 'āina (land) and mo'okūau (lineage), a practice central to pre-contact Hawaiian society.  \n\n• Symbolism of names:  \n  – **'Ama'u**: \"Ama\" (to be lost) + \"u\" (suffix denoting a place or state) – represents the dissolution of traditional structures or the loss of cultural identity.  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāo'o**: \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o\" (to be lost in the depths of the tail) – metaphor for the submersion of ancestral knowledge or the fragmentation of social systems.  \n  – \"Makuahine\" (mother) and \"ho'onoho ihola\" (to place a mark) reference the sacred relationship between ali’i (chief) and 'āina, as well as the imposition of foreign symbols (e.g., missionaries’ markings) post-1820.  \n\n• Historical context:  \n  – The \"Ai Kapu era\" (pre-contact) emphasized strict kapu (sacred laws) that governed resource use and social hierarchy, but the 1819 abolition of the kapu system by Kamehameha II marked a rupture.  \n  – \"Puni a'ela\" (This is also) and \"ki'i akula\" (painted/mark) may symbolize the imposition of foreign scripts and symbols on Hawaiian land after missionary arrival, altering cultural practices.  \n  – The reference to \"Ewa\" (a region on O’ahu) and \"O’ahu nei\" (this O’ahu) highlights localized resistance or adaptation to colonialism, as Ewa was a site of early missionary activity.  \n\n• Allegorical critique of social change:  \n  – The \"deep ocean\" (luku ā pau loa) as a metaphor for the unknown or the loss of traditional knowledge, contrasting with the \"mark on the land\" (ho'onoho ihola) as a symbol of foreign intervention.  \n  – \"No one is you\" (a'ohe kanaka koe) critiques the erasure of indigenous autonomy, reflecting post-contact marginalization of native governance.  \n  – The narrative mirrors the collapse of the kapu system and the rise of Western influence, as seen in the 1820s when missionary schools and Christianity replaced traditional practices.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
