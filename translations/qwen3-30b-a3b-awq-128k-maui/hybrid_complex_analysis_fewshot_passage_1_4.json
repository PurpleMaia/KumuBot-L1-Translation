  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**  \n• The passage introduces **Ihola** (a name) as the resident of a place where two individuals (**‘elua āna**) cultivate ancient **māla ‘uala** (sweet potato fields), preserving them through generations. The naming of these fields as **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (literally \"the eyes of the pāo‘o fish\") connects to the earlier example of **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o**, emphasizing a symbolic link between the protagonist’s physical traits (eyes) and the sacred crop.  \n– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** is likely a reference to the **pāo‘o** (a type of fish, often associated with sacred or symbolic significance in Hawaiian lore). The term “māla” (field) and “‘uala” (sweet potato) tie to agricultural practices central to Hawaiian subsistence and rituals.  \n• **Puali‘i** (a name) is mentioned as the speaker in a quote, which uses **ulua** (a fish species sacred in *Ai Kapu* rituals) as a metaphor for human sacrifice. The phrase “ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala” (“the head of the ulua in the sweet potato”) suggests a symbolic substitution: the **ulua** (fish) replaces the human head, reflecting the *Ai Kapu* era’s practice of replacing human offerings with agricultural products.  \n– **‘Ai Kapu** (sacred food taboos) was a religious system where certain foods were restricted to maintain *mana* (spiritual power). The use of **ulua** as a substitute for human sacrifice (as noted in Pukui & Elbert’s lexicon) highlights the transition from ritualistic violence to sustainable agricultural practices.  \n• **Pōka‘ī** (a name) is identified as **Puali‘i**’s wife, and **“me nā mea ‘ē a‘e”** (“and the other things”) may allude to the sacred *ʻōlelo* (language) and *ho‘ohiki* (authority) of the chiefs. The phrase “a laila, noa, ‘ai kāna wahine” (“and now, free, to his wife”) could imply liberation from *Ai Kapu* restrictions, symbolizing a shift toward secular or communal use of resources.  \n• **Puali‘i**’s action of “iho akula i kai o Honouliuli e lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala” (“going to the coast of Honouliuli to fish with the sweet potato”) allegorically represents the end of *Ai Kapu* practices. Fishing with the **‘uala** (sweet potato) instead of traditional *i‘a* (fish) or human sacrifices signifies the replacement of ritualistic offerings with agricultural ones, a key theme in Hawaiian history during the decline of the *Ai Kapu* system.  \n– **Honouliuli** (a place name) may symbolize a boundary or transition point between sacred and secular life, as it was historically a region associated with both agricultural and spiritual practices.  \n• The structure of the paragraph mirrors Hawaiian oral traditions that blend genealogy, place names, and symbolic language to convey moral or historical lessons. The repetition of **“‘ai”** (food) and **“‘uala”** (sweet potato) underscores the crop’s sacredness and its role in cultural transformation.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
