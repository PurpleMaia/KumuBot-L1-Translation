  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to his mother's cave in Waipouli. Then the mother went to their house in Keahumoa, residing there. Nāmakaokapāo'o took the mat and door from the entrance of the house, and resided in the middle of the entrance.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>At that time, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to his mother's cave in Waipouli. Then the mother went to their house in Keahumoa, residing there. Nāmakaokapāo'o took the mat and door from the entrance of the house, and resided in the middle of the entrance.</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n**Paragraph 11:**  \n• The narrative continues to highlight Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s (Eyes of the Head) actions, emphasizing his disruption of domestic and spiritual spaces; • The \"cave of Waipouli\" (Waipouli: \"waipu\" [to flow] + \"oli\" [a place]) may symbolize a liminal or sacred space, reflecting the transition between earthly and divine realms; • The mother’s movement to \"Keahumoa’s house\" (Keahumoa: \"kea\" [chicken] + \"humoa\" [to gather]) underscores the importance of ancestral land and the re-establishment of familial ties; • The symbolic act of \"removing the mat (mau'u) and door (kua) from the entrance (kau'oku) of the house\" may allegorically represent the dismantling of traditional boundaries or rituals, aligning with the story’s broader critique of 'Ai Kapu (sacred eating) practices; – In Hawaiian culture, the entrance (kau'oku) is a threshold of significance, where social and spiritual exchanges occur. The removal of the mat and door could signify a rejection of ancestral customs or a shift in power dynamics within the household; – The phrase \"resided in the middle of the entrance\" (waena i luna pono o ke kaupoku) may metaphorically indicate Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s defiance of conventional roles, positioning himself as a central figure in a space traditionally reserved for elders or spiritual leaders, reflecting his disruptive, god-like nature; • This passage reinforces the theme of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o as a symbol of forward-thinking, challenging the rigid structures of the 'Ai Kapu era, where such acts of defiance would have carried profound cultural and spiritual implications.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
