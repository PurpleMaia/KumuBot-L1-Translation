They thoroughly knew all the children, they moved and stood at a place of sorrow for the sorrow of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! This is the ko‘ilipi in my hand, it is a thing to be caught for the night of this day, and the night of the night, and then, the pig with the taro, and eat also me in front, and then, peace.” No one was listening from Nāmakaokapāo‘o in these words and Puali‘i, and then, new words of Puali‘i, is the two. In secret, Puali‘i is to catch Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the ko‘ilipi, in that time to pray for Nāmakaokapāo‘o in his prayer of peace for Puali‘i. Thus, the prayer was: “Only the eyes of my heart are open. Be patient, be silent here. Eat perhaps, let perhaps. Let perhaps Nākukui‘aimakaokalani. Is Kukui‘aimakaokalani that. Is my heart’s home this. Is Nāmakaokai‘a the great chief of Hawai‘i. Be silent, be the silence. Only people with the fire. Only the fire and the pahu. Peace only for Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "The passage reflects a blend of Hawaiian oral traditions, mythological references, and ritualistic language. Here's a breakdown of its cultural, historical, and linguistic elements:\n\n**Cultural Context:**\n1. **Names & Deities:** The names *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (likely tied to *Nāmaka*, the god of the sea) and *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* (combining *Kukui* [light] and *aimaka* [to be open]) suggest connections to Hawaiian deities or ancestral figures. *Kukui* is a significant god associated with light and the moon, while *Nāmaka* is a sea deity. The repetition of *okalani* (a suffix often denoting a name or title) indicates a sacred or noble lineage.\n2. **Rituals & Practices:** The mention of *ko‘ilipi* (a type of fish trap or net) and *kālua me ka ‘uala* (pork with taro) points to traditional Hawaiian fishing and food preparation. The phrase *i luna o ke ahi* (“on the fire”) may symbolize a sacred space or a metaphor for conflict, as fire often represents transformation or struggle in Hawaiian cosmology.\n3. **Prayer & Peace (*make*):** The prayer structure emphasizes *make* (peace) as a central theme, likely invoking protection or harmony. The repetition of *e* in the prayer (“E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei”) mirrors the rhythmic cadence of traditional *mele* (chants) and *pule* (prayers), common in Hawaiian oral literature.\n\n**Linguistic Features:**\n1. **Syntax & Structure:** The passage uses complex verb phrases and particles like *iā* (to/for) and *e* (imperative). For example, *Lālau akula ‘o Puali‘i* (“They set up Puali‘i”) employs the causative suffix *-akula* to denote an action completed for a purpose.\n2. **Metaphor and Symbolism:** *Ko‘ilipi* (fish trap) may symbolize a strategy or plan, while *i luna o ke ahi* (“on the fire”) could represent a critical juncture or a sacred space. The term *pahu* (fire) and *ihe* (fire) are repeated, suggesting a focus on the sacredness of fire in rituals.\n3. **Poetic Devices:** The prayer contains parallelism and repetition, such as *E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale* (“Be silent, be the silence”), which is characteristic of Hawaiian *mele* and *pule*. The use of *penei* (“thus”) introduces the prayer, aligning with traditional storytelling conventions.\n\n**Historical Significance:**\n1. **Ancestral Connections:** The names *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* may reference historical or mythological figures from Hawaiian lore, such as chiefs or deities associated with the sea or light. The phrase *ke ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i* (“the great chief of Hawai‘i”) hints at a leadership role, possibly from the pre-colonial era.\n2. **Ritual Practices:** The act of setting up a *ko‘ilipi* and the prayer for peace reflects the importance of rituals in Hawaiian society, where *kālua* (pigs) and *‘uala* (taro) were central to offerings and feasts. The mention of *kālua me ka ‘uala* could symbolize a communal act of sustenance or a sacred meal.\n3. **Conflict and Resolution:** The phrase *ma kahi lō‘ihi* (“at a place of sorrow”) and the invocation of *make* (peace) suggest a narrative of conflict or hardship resolved through spiritual means. The secrecy (*mākaukau*) and the use of *pule* (prayer) imply a ritual to avert danger or secure blessings.\n\n**Key Terms:**\n- *Ko‘ilipi*: A fish trap or net, symbolizing a means of capture or strategy.\n- *Kālua me ka ‘uala*: Traditional food offerings, linking to *mo‘olelo* (stories) of sustenance and community.\n- *Pahu/ihe*: Fire, often representing both physical and spiritual energy in Hawaiian culture.\n- *Make*: Peace, a recurring theme in Hawaiian prayers, emphasizing harmony and balance.\n\nThis passage likely originates from a *mo‘olelo* (legend) or *mele* (chant) tied to the islands of Hawai‘i, blending myth, ritual, and cultural values. The structure and vocabulary reflect the archaic style of Hawaiian oral literature, preserving historical practices and beliefs. The dialogue between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o may symbolize a struggle between human and divine forces, with the prayer serving as a bridge between the mortal and spiritual realms.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
