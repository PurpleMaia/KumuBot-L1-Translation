The head of Nāmakaokapāo'o at that time was a very large head, two wounds from the thorns of the sweet potato vine, he did not stop his work, to continue. When they arrived at the sweet potato patches, as with the children, \"Pull out the roots and the leaves entirely from the surface, so that nothing grows.\" Therefore, the children were only the ones, so that, in the sweet potato, there was no pulling of the roots.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**  \n• The passage introduces a conflict between Puali'i and Nāmakaokapāo'o, emphasizing agricultural practices and symbolic violence. Nāmakaokapāo'o is described as a child with a \"kino ‘u‘uku loa\" (very large head), which may allegorically represent an overreliance on tradition or rigid structures, contrasting with Puali'i’s role as a figure upholding \"Ai Kapu\" (sacred dietary laws). The \"two wounds from the thorns of the sweet potato vine\" (‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e) symbolize the physical and spiritual toll of sustaining \"Ai Kapu\" rituals, where sweet potato cultivation was both a practical and sacred act.  \n• The phrase \"e huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala ā pau loa i luna, mai waiho i kekahi e ulu ana\" (pull out the roots and the leaves entirely from the surface, so that nothing grows) reflects a radical act of severing agricultural ties, possibly alluding to the dismantling of \"Ai Kapu\" practices. This mirrors the earlier example where Nāmakaokapāo'o destroyed sweet potato patches, symbolizing a break from ritualized restrictions. The \"pu‘e\" (roots) and \"lau ‘uala\" (leaves) are central to sweet potato cultivation, and their destruction here could represent a rejection of the sacred system that governed such labor.  \n• \"Kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala, ‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e\" (in the sweet potato, there was no pulling of the roots) suggests a shift in agricultural methodology. The \"kāohi mālie\" (only the children) may imply a generational divide, where younger generations (like Nāmakaokapāo'o) abandon traditional practices (e.g., \"Ai Kapu\" restrictions on harvesting), while older figures (Puali'i) cling to them. This aligns with the broader narrative of progressive vs. conservative forces in Hawaiian history, where \"Ai Kapu\" era customs were challenged by new ideas.  \n• The names carry symbolic weight:  \n– **Nāmakaokapāo'o** (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o): \"Maka\" (eyes) and \"pāo'o\" (a type of fish, often associated with strength or leadership). The name could signify a child of \"pāo'o\" (fish), metaphorically tied to the \"Ai Kapu\" era’s reliance on fish as a sacred resource.  \n– **Puali'i** (Pua-li'i): \"Pua\" (child, blossom) and \"li'i\" (to grow, cultivate). The name may reflect his role as a cultivator of both land and tradition, contrasting with Nāmakaokapāo'o’s destructive actions.  \n• The act of \"huhuki\" (pulling out roots) is a ritualized agricultural practice in \"Ai Kapu\" culture, where sweet potato farming was tied to kapu (sacred laws) and spiritual offerings. Nāmakaokapāo'o’s defiance of this practice—destroying the patches without restraint—symbolizes a rupture with ancestral customs, akin to the earlier example where his father’s rage against the \"Ai Kapu\" system led to threats of violence. This passage underscores the tension between preserving sacred agricultural traditions and the rise of more secular, progressive practices.  \n• The mention of \"kāne\" (man) and \"wahine\" (woman) in the context of \"keiki\" (children) highlights the societal structure of the \"Ai Kapu\" era, where children were central to both labor and spiritual roles. The dialogue between Puali'i and the children, though not explicitly stated here, may echo the earlier example’s emphasis on reciprocal hospitality and the moral obligations of the time.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
