  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \n\"Give to Nāmakaokapāo'o: 'I know, he is a great man, and he went to Ko'olau, to you, his name is.' They said: 'No, it is you, like our words, now, to make you ours, do not you live.' Nāmakaokapāo'o said: 'Return, return we to below to search.' They went down, they searched for Nāmakaokapāo'o, ended in death, and you take one person, that is the one who went and found Ama'u in Waikīkī, speaking to the dead of them all, and you also to the place to search for Ama'u.\"  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• [Narrative context: Ritual of search and transformation]  \n  – The passage reflects a traditional Hawaiian ritual of *kāne* (search) and *ho'okipa* (invitation), central to pre-contact spiritual practices. The act of \"searching for Nāmakaokapāo'o\" may symbolize the quest for ancestral knowledge or the soul’s journey.  \n  – The phrase \"pau loa i ka make\" (ended in death) aligns with the *ʻAi Kapu* era’s emphasis on sacred boundaries between life and death, where rituals often involved confronting mortality.  \n\n• [Symbolism of names: Nāmakaokapāo'o and Ama'u]  \n  – *Nāmakaokapāo'o*: \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o\" (the one who is like the sea’s search). *Nā-maka* (sea) and *pāo'o* (to search/seek) suggest a metaphor for a navigator or spiritual seeker.  \n  – *Ama'u*: \"A-ma'u\" (silent/quiet). The name may symbolize the hidden or sacred, reflecting the *moolelo* (mythology) of deities associated with stillness, such as *Ku* (war god) or *Hina* (moon goddess).  \n\n• [Historical context: Post-1820 missionary influence]  \n  – The text’s structure and themes may reflect post-1820 shifts, as missionary activity introduced new interpretations of spiritual practices. The \"search for Ama'u\" could allegorically represent the loss of traditional knowledge under colonialism.  \n  – The phrase \"e make ana 'oe iā mākou\" (to make you ours) hints at cultural assimilation, a theme prevalent after 1820 when Hawaiian sovereignty faced erosion.  \n\n• [Numerical symbolism and riddles]  \n  – The repetition of \"ho'i aku ho'i hā\" (return, return we) may allude to the *kūʻau* (sacred) number 4, representing the four directions or the four elements, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and death.  \n  – \"Pau loa i ka make\" (ended in death) could encode the *makahiki* (season of peace) cycle, where death and renewal were tied to lunar and solar calendars.  \n\n• [Cultural critique: Identity and erasure]  \n  – The dialogue critiques the erasure of indigenous identity, as \"make ana\" (to make you ours) reflects colonial attempts to redefine Hawaiian identity.  \n  – The search for Ama'u in Waikīkī (a historically significant place) may symbolize the struggle to preserve sacred spaces amid foreign influence.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
