  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nNāmakaokapāo'o said: \"I know, he is indeed a great man, and he has gone to Ko'olau, and your name is his.\" They replied: \"No, only you, that is our story, now, you will become us, you will not live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Let us go down together to search.\" They went down, searching for Nāmakaokapāo'o, having died completely, and you are one person, that is the one who went to Waikīkī to find 'Ama'u, speaking about the death of them all, and you are in the place where 'Ama'u is found.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\nThis passage is part of a traditional Hawaiian narrative, likely from a mythological or historical text, such as a chant or story from the Kumulipo or other cultural epics. The dialogue and actions suggest a mythic or legendary context, involving characters like Nāmakaokapāo'o and 'Ama'u, who may be deities or ancestral figures. The mention of Ko'olau (a mountain on O'ahu) and Waikīkī (a district in Honolulu) anchors the story in specific Hawaiian landscapes. The themes of death (\"make\"), transformation (\"e make ana\"), and searching (\"hakakā ai\") reflect common motifs in Hawaiian oral traditions, emphasizing the interplay between life, death, and the spiritual realm. The structure, with direct speech and imperative verbs, aligns with the performative style of ancient Hawaiian storytelling, where dialogue and action are central to conveying moral or cosmological lessons.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
