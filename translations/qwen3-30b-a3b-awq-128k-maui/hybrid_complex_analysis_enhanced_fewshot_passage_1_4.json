The phrase \"iho akula ‘o Puali‘i i kai o Honouliuli e lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala\" (Puali'i went to the shore of Honouliuli to fish with the sweet potato) reflects the integration of agricultural and ritual practices, where the sweet potato (‘uala) is both a staple crop and a sacred offering. – \"Kālua\" in \"kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala\" is a term with dual meanings: 1) a type of sweet potato (Pukui & Elbert 1986: 369: *kālua* – \"a kind of sweet potato\"), and 2) a poetic reference to \"heiau\" (temple), as *kālua* can also mean \"to be set apart\" or \"sacred.\" This duality underscores the sacredness of the crop and its connection to ritual.  \n• Puali'i’s statement \"Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala\" (This is the head of the ulua and the sweet potato) alludes to the *Ai Kapu* era, where *ulua* (fish) was symbolically substituted for human sacrifices. Here, the sweet potato (‘uala) replaces *ulua*, reflecting a shift in ritual practices. The phrase \"po‘o o ka ulua\" (head of the ulua) may metaphorically refer to the *po‘o* (head) of a chief, linking the crop to the concept of *makua* (children) and *kūʻike* (sacredness).  \n• The act of \"‘ai kāna wahine, Pōka‘ī a me nā mea ‘ē a‘e\" (eat his wife, Pōka'ī, and the other things) is allegorical, representing the destruction of traditional values or the severing of familial ties. Pōka'ī, as Nāmakaokapāo'o’s mother, symbolizes the *moʻokūauhau* (lineage) and the *ʻōlelo hoʻohiki* (sacred language) of the heiau. This mirrors the earlier conflict between Puali'i’s adherence to *Ai Kapu* and Nāmakaokapāo'o’s progressive defiance.  \n• The movement to *kai o Honouliuli* (shore of Honouliuli) ties to the *kula* (circle, ritual) and *moa* (chickens), suggesting a symbolic reorientation from *Keahumoa* (the plains of Keahumoa) to a new location. This reflects the story’s theme of cultural transition, where Puali'i’s actions represent clinging to old traditions, while Nāmakaokapāo'o’s earlier destruction of sweet potato patches symbolizes breaking from *Ai Kapu* practices.  \n• The repetition of \"iho akula\" (went to) and \"kai\" (shore) highlights the importance of *moʻolelo* (stories) as spatial and temporal anchors. Honouliuli, a place associated with *kūʻike* (sacredness) and *hoʻi* (return), becomes a site of conflict between Puali'i’s ritualistic demands and Nāmakaokapāo'o’s rebellious growth, allegorically representing the tension between *kapu* (sacred restrictions) and *alaka‘i* (leadership, innovation).",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
