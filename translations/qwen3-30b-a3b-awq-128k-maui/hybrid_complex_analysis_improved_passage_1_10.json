  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "The story of Puali‘i, then Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother was in the direction of the sea, to Pōka‘ī, residing there, without any food for Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the sea. At that time, ‘Ama‘u was an ali‘i of O‘ahu, in Waikīkī, a place where someone went to Honouliuli from the sea, residing with the ali‘i. She said: “O, noble ali‘i! There was a very strong child, a powerful child, her father died and her head was cut off in the ocean. It was a very sacred place, five miles is the sacred place. A lohe of ‘Ama‘u, there is strength and death in her. Therefore, I do not speak without strength in her. She speaks in Waikīkī, only Nāmakaokapāo‘o is known by these words.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>The story of Puali‘i, then Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother was in the direction of the sea, to Pōka‘ī, residing there, without any food for Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the sea.

The term \"pāo‘o\" may symbolize a guardian or a specific resource, while \"Nāmaka\" (sea) ties her to the ocean’s power.  \n  – *Pōka‘ī*: Pō-ka‘i (night of the kā‘i [a name or metaphor for a boundary]). Suggests a liminal space or transition, aligning with the narrative’s focus on death and sacredness.  \n  – *‘Ama‘u*: Ama-u (child of the sea). Reinforces her connection to the ocean and its role as both life-giver and source of danger, reflecting the dual nature of *moana* (ocean) in Hawaiian thought.  \n\n• Historical and cultural context:  \n  – The reference to \"ali‘i of O‘ahu\" and \"Waikīkī\" situates the narrative in the pre-contact or early contact period, emphasizing the social hierarchy of *ali‘i* (chiefly class) and the sacredness of *‘āina* (land).  \n  – The mention of \"Honouliuli\" (a historical site associated with the Mākaha Stream and ancient rituals) and \"Waikīkī\" highlights the geographical and spiritual significance of these places during the *‘Ai Kapu* era (pre-1819), when certain areas were restricted for religious or social reasons.  \n  – The \"head cut off in the ocean\" (kiola i kai loa) may allude to *kāne‘o* (sacrificial rituals) or the symbolic severing of a chief’s connection to the land, reflecting the collapse of traditional kapu systems.  \n\n• Post-contact social commentary:  \n  – The text’s focus on \"sacred places\" (lohe) and the phrase \"I do not speak without strength\" (i ‘ole au e make iā ia) might critique the erosion of indigenous knowledge systems after 1820, as missionary influence introduced new values and disrupted oral traditions.  \n  – The fragmented structure of the passage mirrors the disintegration of traditional governance and the displacement of *kūpuna* (elders) as colonialism reshaped Hawaiian society.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
