To Pōka‘ī, they dwelled there, no food for Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u was an ali‘i of O‘ahu, in Waikīkī a place to live, going to Honouliuli from Waikīkī, the ali‘i was dwelling there. He said: \"O royal one! The son of the chief was very strong, the father died and the head was cut off in the ocean, it was a very deep place, five miles the depth.\" The one who was strong, and died by him, so, in the absence of strength, he died without strength. He spoke in Waikīkī, the one who was strong was Nāmakaokapāo‘o in these words.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The mention of \"no food for Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" (‘a‘ohe ‘ai o Nāmakaokapāo‘o) may critique the rigidness of kapu, which was abolished in 1819, leading to societal shifts.]  \n  – [The movement from **Waikīkī** to **Honouliuli** (a historical region in O‘ahu) could symbolize the displacement of traditional power centers during the 19th century, reflecting the impact of foreign contact and missionary influence post-1820. The \"deep ocean\" (kai loa) may allegorically represent the *mo‘o* (mythical creature) or the *kai* (ocean) as a liminal space between worlds.]  \n  – [The phrase \"five miles the depth\" (‘elima mile ka lō‘ihi) may encode **numerical symbolism**, with \"five\" (‘elima) representing the five elements of Hawaiian cosmology (earth, water, fire, wind, void), emphasizing the magnitude of loss or transformation.]  \n\n• [Social commentary and critique]  \n  – [The death of the chief's son (\"keiki ‘u‘uku ikaika loa\") and the severing of his head (\"kiola ‘ia kona po‘o\") could allegorically critique the **vulnerability of ali‘i (noble) power** during the 1819-1820s, when traditional leadership was challenged by Western missionaries and the introduction of new religious and social norms.]  \n  – [The repetition of \"i ka ‘ai\" (in the food) and \"i kai loa\" (in the ocean) may highlight the tension between **sustenance (‘ai)** and **transcendence (kai)**, reflecting the shift from indigenous knowledge systems to foreign agricultural and spiritual practices.]  \n  – [The phrase \"in the absence of strength, he died without strength\" (\"i ‘ole au e make iā ia ‘a‘ohe ona ikaika\") underscores the **fragility of power** under colonial pressures, a theme echoed in historical accounts of the 1820s when traditional ali‘i were marginalized by missionary influence (Kuykendall, 1952).]  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
