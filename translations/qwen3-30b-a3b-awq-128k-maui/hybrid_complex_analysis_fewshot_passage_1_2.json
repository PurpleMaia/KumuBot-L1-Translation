  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 2:**  \n• The structure of this paragraph continues the narrative of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s lineage, emphasizing familial and geographic connections:  \n– **Hō‘ae‘ae (place name):** Likely refers to a specific location in Ewa, O‘ahu, suggesting a sacred or significant site. The name \"Hō‘ae‘ae\" may derive from \"ho‘ae\" (to grow, to flourish) or \"ho‘ā‘ā\" (to be full, to be abundant), reflecting a place of fertility or spiritual importance.  \n– **\"Ma laila lāua i launa kino ai me ka moe ana iho ā loa‘a o Nāmakaokapāo‘o\":** This describes the circumstances of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s birth. \"Launa kino ai\" (to have a child) and \"ka moe ana iho\" (while sleeping) may imply a divine or supernatural origin, as sleep often symbolizes a liminal state between worlds in Hawaiian cosmology. \"Ā loa‘a\" (to find) suggests a serendipitous or fateful discovery, possibly hinting at the child’s destined role.  \n– **Pōka‘ī (f) and Kauluakaha‘i (m):** These names are linked to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s parents. \"Pōka‘ī\" may derive from \"pō\" (night) and \"ka‘ī\" (to take, to seize), symbolizing a connection to the spiritual realm or nocturnal forces. \"Kauluakaha‘i\" combines \"kau\" (to stretch, to extend) and \"kaha‘i\" (a name), possibly alluding to a journey or expansion of power.  \n• The phrase \"ho‘i akula o Kauluakaha‘i i kona ‘āina\" (Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land) reflects the cultural practice of *kānaka* (humans) navigating between *moʻolelo* (stories) and *ʻōlelo* (language), where ancestral journeys or migrations are often recounted. \"Kona ‘āina\" (his land) emphasizes territorial lineage, tying Kauluakaha‘i to a specific geographic identity.  \n• **\"Noho ihola o Pōka‘ī me kona hāpai\" (dwelling with Pōka‘ī and his father):** This suggests a dual lineage—Pōka‘ī’s connection to her own father (possibly a deity or high chief) and Kauluakaha‘i’s return to his ancestral land. The term \"hāpai\" (to give birth) may imply a sacred or ritualistic context for the birth, aligning with the *Ai Kapu* era’s emphasis on ritual purity and divine ancestry.  \n• **Allegorical interpretation of \"hānau ‘ana\":** The phrase \"ma kēia hānau ‘ana\" (in this way of birth) may allude to the transition from *Ai Kapu* (sacred restrictions) to a post-sacrificial era. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s birth here could symbolize the end of human sacrifice, with \"kāna keiki\" (his child) representing the next generation freed from such practices.  \n• **Cultural context:** The repetition of names and places underscores the importance of genealogy in Hawaiian storytelling. Pōka‘ī’s role as a mother and Kauluakaha‘i’s return to his land highlight the interplay between *kupuna* (elders) and *kūkanākā* (descendants), reflecting the *kula* (circle) of ancestral knowledge and responsibility.",

When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",

When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
