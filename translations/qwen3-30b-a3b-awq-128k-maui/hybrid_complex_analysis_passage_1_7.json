  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "Then Puali‘i also taught the ko‘ilipi and went to the place where Nāmakaokapāo‘o was found, among the four fishers, by the fire. They all knew, and they were silent in a place of silence for the sake of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! This is the ko‘ilipi in my hand, it is a thing of the night for this day, and the night, and then, the kālua with the ‘uala, and eat me first, and then, peace.” No one was listening to Nāmakaokapāo‘o in these words, and then Puali‘i spoke new words, which were the two. Puali‘i was careful to take Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the ko‘ilipi, in that time to pray for Nāmakaokapāo‘o in his prayer for Puali‘i. Thus he prayed: “Only the face of my pāo‘o, Be silent, be quiet here, Eat, let me eat. Let me rest, Nākukui‘aimakaokalani. That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani. This is my place of rest. Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i. Be gone, the hōhē is gone. Only people with the ihe. Only the ihe with the pahu. Only with Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "This passage is rich with cultural, historical, and linguistic elements rooted in traditional Hawaiian practices. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Cultural Context:**\n1. **Prayer and Rituals:** The text reflects the importance of prayer (*pule*) in Hawaiian culture, where invocations to deities or natural forces were central to activities like fishing, agriculture, or warfare. The phrase \"e he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale\" (Be gone, the hōhē is gone) may allude to a ritualistic dismissal of a spirit or a symbolic act of releasing a catch, aligning with the concept of *ʻāina* (land/earth) and *mo‘olelo* (stories/legends) that emphasize harmony with nature.\n2. **Deities and Ancestral Figures:** Names like *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* likely reference deities or ancestral figures. *Kukui* (light, moon) and *Nāmaka* (sea) are common in Hawaiian mythology, suggesting a connection to oceanic or celestial deities. *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* might be a composite name combining *kukui* (light) and *aimaka* (a type of fish), while *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* could relate to the sea (*nāmaka*) and *okapāo‘o* (a term for a type of fish or a place name).\n3. **Fishing and Resource Management:** The mention of *ko‘ilipi* (a type of fish) and *kālua* (a type of fish or a fishing net) highlights traditional Hawaiian fishing practices. The phrase \"kālua me ka ‘uala\" (kālua with the ‘uala) may refer to specific fishing techniques or tools, underscoring the cultural significance of sustainable resource use.\n\n**Linguistic Features:**\n1. **Syntax and Structure:** Hawaiian sentences often begin with verbs or nouns, as seen in \"Lālau akula ‘o Puali‘i\" (He was also taught by Puali‘i). The use of *e* as a particle for commands (\"E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei\") is characteristic of invocations or prayers.\n2. **Proper Nouns and Metaphors:** Names like *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* are likely metaphorical or symbolic, blending elements of nature (e.g., *nāmaka* for sea, *kukui* for light) with ancestral or divine titles. The repetition of *e* in the prayer (\"E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha\") emphasizes urgency or emphasis, a common stylistic device in Hawaiian oratory.\n3. **Poetic and Rhythmic Elements:** The prayer's structure mirrors traditional Hawaiian *mele* (poetry), with parallelism and alliteration. For example, \"E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale\" uses repetition for effect, a hallmark of Hawaiian oral traditions.\n\n**Historical Significance:**\n1. **Ancestral Practices:** The passage may originate from a *mo‘olelo* (legend) or *ʻōlelo no‘eau* (proverb) that illustrates the relationship between humans and deities in pre-colonial Hawaii. The act of \"taking\" (*‘o‘oki*) Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the ko‘ilipi could symbolize a spiritual or ritualistic transfer of power or responsibility.\n2. **Names as Cultural Anchors:** The names *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* might be tied to specific historical events or genealogies. For instance, *Nāmakaokai‘a* (the great chief of Hawai‘i) could reference a ruling ali‘i (chief) or a legendary figure, reflecting the hierarchical structure of Hawaiian society.\n3. **Symbolism of Elements:** The fire (*ke ahi*) and the sea (*nāmaka*) are recurring symbols in Hawaiian cosmology, representing transformation and life-giving forces. The phrase \"i luna o ke ahi\" (on the fire) might symbolize a sacred space or a metaphor for a trial or purification.\n\n**Key Terms:**\n- *Ko‘ilipi:* A type of fish, possibly a sacred or ritualistic term.\n- *Pahu:* A fish species, but also a verb meaning \"to rest\" or \"to be silent,\" suggesting a dual meaning in the prayer.\n- *Ihe:* A staff or spear, often used in rituals, symbolizing authority or a tool for spiritual connection.\n- *Hōhē:* A term for a type of fish or a metaphor for a spiritual entity, possibly linked to the afterlife or ancestral spirits.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis passage exemplifies the integration of language, spirituality, and daily life in Hawaiian culture. The prayer structure, with its imperative verbs and symbolic references, reflects the deep reverence for natural resources and deities. The names and terms used here are not just labels but carry layered meanings tied to Hawaiian cosmology and social practices, emphasizing the interconnectedness of humans, nature, and the divine.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
