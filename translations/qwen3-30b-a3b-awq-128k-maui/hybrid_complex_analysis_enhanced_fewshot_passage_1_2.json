This may symbolize his role as a bridge between generations or a figure of authority;  \n• The phrase \"a hāpai ‘o Pōka‘ī iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" (Pōka‘ī adopted Nāmakaokapāo‘o) reflects the *kūʻike* (to raise, to nurture) tradition, where children were formally adopted to ensure lineage continuity and spiritual protection;  \n– **Kāne (father) and wahine (mother):** The names Pōka‘ī and Kauluakaha‘i are linked to parental roles, with Kauluakaha‘i as the biological father (as per earlier context) and Pōka‘ī as the adoptive mother, illustrating the fluidity of familial ties in Hawaiian culture;  \n• The mention of Kauluakaha‘i coming to Pōka‘ī’s land and residing with her and her adoptive child suggests a *kula* (ritual or communal) connection, reinforcing the idea of shared responsibility and *ʻāina* (land) as a unifying force;  \n– **Noho ihola (to reside with):** Implies a temporary or permanent integration into a family, reflecting the *ho'okupu* (to plant, to establish) metaphor for fostering relationships;  \n• The final line, \"Ma kēia hānau ‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o,\" (In this birth, Pōka‘ī was very pregnant and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o) may allegorically represent the tension between *ʻāina* (land) and *kūʻike* (nurturing), symbolizing the struggle between traditional practices and the emergence of new cultural paradigms during the transition from the 'Ai Kapu era to a more secularized society;  \n– **‘Ilima (pregnant):** The term \"‘ilihune\" (pregnant) here may allude to the *mākua* (child) as a sacred entity, tied to the *kūpuna* (elders) who guided *kūʻike* (nurturing) through rituals and spiritual connections;  \n– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s name:** \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o\" (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish), a poetic reference to *maka* (eyes) and *pāo‘o* (a type of fish), symbolizing perception and resourcefulness, traits central to Hawaiian navigators and leaders.
