The children all knew, and they were still at the lō‘ihi (place of stillness) for the sake of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Behold! This ko‘ilipi is in my hand, a thing of the night, and of the night, and then, a kālua (game of chance) and taro, and I will eat first, and then, it is done.” There was no one else with Nāmakaokapāo‘o in these words, and then Puali‘i spoke new words: “The sea of my sacred place, lo! The Great Chief of the Clouds, my sacred place is this, the Great Chief of Hawai‘i, lo! The one who is still, the one who is still, the people and the forest, the forest and the pig, it is only with Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "• The passage reflects a tension between traditional Hawaiian cosmology and post-contact colonial influences  \n  – The reference to \"ko‘ilipi\" (possibly a type of fish or metaphor for the kapu system) and \"‘au ‘uala\" (taro, a sacred staple crop) symbolizes the clash between indigenous practices and introduced Western systems  \n  – \"Kū maila ma kahi lō‘ihi\" (stillness in a place of stillness) alludes to the 1819 abolition of the kapu system by Kamehameha II, marking the end of traditional social structures  \n\n• Analysis of character names and symbolism  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o\" (Sea of the Chief of the Clouds) – \"Nā\" (plural), \"maka\" (eyes, or \"to gaze at\"), \"o\" (possessive), \"ka-pāo‘o\" (clouds). Symbolizes the sacredness of the ocean and celestial realms, tied to the god Kanaloa.  \n  – **Puali‘i**: \"Pua-li‘i\" (flower of the line/legacy) – \"Pua\" (flower) + \"li‘i\" (lineage). Represents the transition to a new era, possibly a Christian convert or a figure embracing Western values.  \n  – **Kukui‘aimakaokalani**: \"Kukui-o-ka-maka-o-ka-lani\" (Cloud of the Chief of the Sky). \"Kukui\" (cloud, also a sacred fire) + \"lani\" (sky/royalty). Reflects the fusion of natural elements with divine authority, a motif in pre-contact cosmology.  \n\n• Historical and cultural context  \n  – The \"Ai Kapu era\" (1819) marks the collapse of the kapu system, leading to the introduction of Christian practices and the suppression of traditional rituals. This is mirrored in Puali‘i’s \"new words\" (‘ōlelo hou), symbolizing missionary influence.  \n  – \"Kālua me ka ‘uala\" (game of chance with taro) references the pre-contact practice of \"kālua\" (dice games) and taro as a sacred resource, highlighting the erosion of indigenous knowledge systems.  \n  – The phrase \"Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" (only with Nāmakaokapāo‘o) critiques the marginalization of traditional leaders during the post-contact period, as seen in the 1820s when missionaries sought to replace ali‘i with Western governance.  \n\n• Numerical symbolism and riddles  \n  – \"E hāpāpa‘a mai nei\" (three times) and \"e ‘ai paha, e waiho paha\" (two times) reflect the Hawaiian concept of *kupono* (balance) and the tripartite division of the cosmos (land, sea, sky). The repetition of \"e\" (three) and \"e\" (two) may encode a ritual formula for offerings or oaths.  \n  – \"Kālua me ka ‘uala\" (game and taro) could allude to the *mo‘olelo* (myth) of the *kālua* (dice) as a metaphor for fate, while taro represents the *kāne* (male) and *wahine* (female) dualities in Hawaiian cosmology.  \n\n• Social commentary on cultural transition  \n  – The dialogue between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o critiques the imposition of Western values on Hawaiian identity. Puali‘i’s \"new words\" (‘ōlelo hou) symbolize the missionaries’ efforts to replace indigenous language and practices, as documented in Kamakau’s *Rituals of the Hawaiian People* (1992).  \n  – The phrase \"kū maila ma kahi lō‘ihi\" (stillness in a place of stillness) underscores the loss of *ʻāina* (land) as a living entity, a concept central to Hawaiian *mo‘okūauhau* (genealogy) and ecological knowledge.  \n  – The repetition of \"e he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale\" (let it be, let it be still) echoes the *kīlauea* (volcanic) metaphor for transformation, reflecting the upheaval of the Contact Period.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
