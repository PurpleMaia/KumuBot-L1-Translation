They fully understood the children, and they were placed in a sacred place for the protection of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! This is the ko‘ilipi in my hand, a sacred object for the gods in this era, and the land of the gods, and then, the canoe with the taro, and I will eat first, and then, it is free.” There was no one to question Nāmakaokapāo‘o in these words, and then Puali‘i spoke anew: “Only the eye of my sacred place. Hapupu‘u, come to me for protection. Eat, perhaps, leave, perhaps. Leave, perhaps, Nākukui‘aimakaokalani. That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani. This is my sacred place.

Its placement in Puali‘i’s hand signifies the transmission of cultural authority.  \n  – The \"four waves of the sea\" (āna ‘ehā) may allegorically reference the four sacred directions or the four elements (earth, water, fire, air), emphasizing the interconnectedness of Hawaiian cosmology.  \n\n• [Symbolism of names: Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o]  \n  – **Puali‘i**: Breakdown: *Pua* (flower, symbolizing growth or vitality) + *li‘i* (to be small, young, or humble). Represents a figure of emerging power or a new generation navigating tradition.  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o* (the great eye of the sea). \"Maka\" (eye) and \"pāo‘o\" (great) suggest a guardian of the ocean, possibly linked to Pele (volcanic deity) or other deities of the sea, symbolizing protection and ancestral wisdom.  \n  – **Kukui‘aimakaokalani**: *Kukui* (light, source of light) + *aimaka* (white) + *okalani* (place of). Likely references a deity of light or a sacred place, possibly Kukui (goddess of lightning) or a localized variant, symbolizing enlightenment or divine authority.  \n\n• [Historical context: Post-1819 cultural shifts and missionary influence]  \n  – The mention of \"pule make\" (prayer for protection) and the \"ko‘ilipi\" may reflect tensions during the **Ai Kapu era (1819)**, when Kamehameha II abolished the kapu system, disrupting traditional religious practices. The narrative could allegorically depict the struggle to preserve sacred objects amid societal change.  \n  – The phrase \"make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" (only with Nāmakaokapāo‘o) may critique the erosion of indigenous authority, as missionaries later marginalized ali‘i (chiefs) and introduced new hierarchies.  \n\n• [Numerical symbolism: The \"four waves\" (āna ‘ehā)]  \n  – The number four (āna ‘ehā) is significant in Hawaiian cosmology, representing the four sacred directions (*kūmūho‘ō*) and the four elements. This reinforces the idea of balance and the cyclical nature of life, contrasting with the disruptive \"abandonment\" of kapu.  \n  – The \"canoe with the taro\" (*kālua me ka ‘uala*) symbolizes sustenance and migration, linking to the sacred plant *‘uala* (taro) as the ancestor of the Hawaiian people (*kānuu ka po‘o*—the sacred lineage).  \n\n• [Cultural practices and social commentary]  \n  – The \"ihi\" (sacred place) where the children are \"kū maila\" (placed) may reference *heiau* (temples) or *mo’okū’auhau* (sacred spaces), highlighting the sanctity of such locations in pre-contact Hawaiian society.  \n  – The dialogue’s ambiguity (\"e ‘ai paha, e waiho paha\") reflects the tension between old and new beliefs, as the arrival of missionaries introduced uncertainty, leading to the decline of traditional practices.  \n\n• [Post-contact biases and hybridity]  \n  – The structure of the prayer (\"Aloha wale ka maka...\") may blend pre-contact invocations with later Christian influences, as missionaries often reinterpreted Hawaiian terms.

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
