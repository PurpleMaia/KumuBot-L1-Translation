  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "At night, he went to her mother's place, hidden in the canyon of Waipouli. Then the mother, after that, went to their house in Keahumoa, resided there. He placed Nāmakaokapāo'o on the roof of the house, took the burden of the head and the shoulder, and slept there in the middle of the roof of the house.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>At night, he went to her mother's place, hidden in the canyon of Waipouli. Then the mother, after that, went to their house in Keahumoa, resided there. He placed Nāmakaokapāo'o on the roof of the house, took the burden of the head and the shoulder, and slept there in the middle of the roof of the house.</translation>  \n\n<commentary>This passage is part of a traditional Hawaiian narrative, likely from a story involving familial relationships, movement between locations, and cultural practices. The mention of specific place names like Waipouli and Keahumoa suggests a localized setting, while the actions of \"placing\" and \"taking the burden\" may reflect rituals or symbolic acts. The structure emphasizes sequential events, a hallmark of oral storytelling in Hawaiian tradition, and the roof (\"kaupoku\") as a space for rest or responsibility, common in historical and mythological texts.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
