They placed Nāmakaokapāo'o over the roof of the house, they placed the shadow of the head and the shadow of the foot, and they dwelled in the middle of the shadow of the roof.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nThen it was night, they went to the woman's place in the grove of Waipouli. Then the woman, they went to their house in Keahumoa, to dwell. They placed Nāmakaokapāo'o over the roof of the house, they placed the shadow of the head and the shadow of the foot, and they dwelled in the middle of the shadow of the roof.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• [Narrative context reflecting post-contact cultural tensions]  \n  – [The text mirrors the upheaval of the 'Ai Kapu era (pre-1819) and the subsequent societal shifts after 1819, when the kapu system was abolished, symbolizing the collapse of traditional religious structures.]  \n  – [The movement from \"Waipouli\" (a grove, symbolizing natural sacred spaces) to \"Keahumoa\" (a constructed space) critiques the transition from communal to individualized living under missionary influence.]  \n\n• [Symbolism of the name \"Nāmakaokapāo'o\"]  \n  – [Etymology: \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o\" – \"Nā\" (plural), \"maka\" (eyes), \"ka-pāo'o\" (possibly \"pāo,\" to teach or instruct, or a place name). The name could imply \"Eyes of the Teacher\" or \"Eyes of the Pāo'o (sacred knowledge).\"]  \n  – [Allegorically, \"Nāmakaokapāo'o\" represents the transmission of knowledge, blending traditional wisdom (\"pāo'o\") with the new Christian teachings introduced by missionaries, reflecting the duality of pre- and post-contact Hawaiian epistemology.]  \n\n• [Cultural practices and historical transitions]  \n  – [The act of \"placing the shadow of the head and foot\" references the Hawaiian concept of \"mau’ole\" (shadow) as a metaphor for ancestral presence or spiritual protection, a practice tied to the 'Ai Kapu era’s emphasis on sacred spaces.]  \n  – [The phrase \"moe ihola ma waena i luna pono o ke kaupoku\" (dwelling in the middle of the roof’s shadow) may symbolize the \"waena\" (middle) as a liminal space, reflecting the tension between old and new worldviews post-1820 missionary influence.]  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
