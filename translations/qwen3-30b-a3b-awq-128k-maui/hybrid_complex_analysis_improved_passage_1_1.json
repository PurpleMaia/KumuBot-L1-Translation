This could imply \"The Opened Eyes of the Extended One,\" symbolizing vision or foresight in navigating the spiritual and physical worlds.  \n  – **Kauluakaha‘i**: \"Kau-lu-a-kaha‘i\" (Kau = to stretch, lu = to extend, a = and, kaha‘i = name). Suggests \"The Extender and the One Who Stretches,\" reflecting the role of a leader or ancestor in expanding territory or knowledge.  \n  – **Kahikipapaialewa**: \"Kahi-pa-pa-i-lewa\" (Kahi = a, pa = to place, papa = board, i = in, lewa = to be high). May denote \"A Place of the Elevated Board,\" symbolizing a sacred or elevated space, possibly linked to the kapu system’s rituals.  \n  – **Pōka‘ī**: \"Pō-ka‘ī\" (Pō = night, ka‘ī = name). \"Night’s One\" could allude to a guardian of the unseen or a figure associated with the spiritual realm, contrasting with the \"koa\" (tree) symbolizing strength and warriors.  \n  – **Kahikinu‘u**: \"Kahi-ki-nu‘u\" (Kahi = a, ki = to, nu‘u = high). \"A High Place of the Foreigner\" (Kahiki = foreign) may allegorically represent the encroachment of Western influence, a theme post-1820 missionary contact.  \n\n• Historical and cultural context:  \n  – The mention of \"u‘uku\" (fish) and \"koa\" (tree) connects to the *‘Ai Kapu* era, where natural resources were governed by strict kapu (sacred laws). The \"two of these\" could reflect the dualities of Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., *mo‘o* and *moana*, land and sea), but also the disruption of these systems by colonialism.  \n  – \"Kahikinu‘u\" (foreign high place) may critique the post-1820 shift as missionaries introduced foreign concepts, replacing indigenous *mo‘o* (land) and *moana* (ocean) with colonial land divisions.  \n  – The term \"ao‘ao akua kekahi ona\" (a priest of one) highlights the erosion of the traditional *kānaka‘aumakua* (priesthood) structure, as missionaries later redefined religious authority.  \n\n• Social commentary and allegory:  \n  – The \"strong child in its young days\" (keiki ikaika loa i kona wā ‘ōpiopio) may allegorically depict the resilience of Hawaiian society during the *Ai Kapu* era, while the \"long ‘u‘uku\" symbolizes the enduring spiritual ties to the ocean.  \n  – The names \"Kauluakaha‘i\" (father) and \"Pōka‘ī\" (mother) could represent the fusion of male and female energies, but their association with \"Kahikipapaialewa\" (a land in Kahikinu‘u) critiques the displacement of traditional *ʻāina* (land) by foreign concepts of ownership and hierarchy.  \n  – The narrative’s focus on \"Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau\" (Hawai‘i and Ni‘ihau) may symbolize the fragmentation of Hawaiian identity, as Ni‘ihau, a remote island, became a site of cultural preservation but also isolation under colonialism.  \n\n• Numerical symbolism:  \n  – The number \"two\" (lua) in \"‘a‘ohe ona lua\" reflects the Hawaiian *mo‘o* (land) and *moana* (ocean) duality, but also the \"two\" in the *kānaka‘aumakua* (priesthood) and *mo‘i* (monarch) roles, which were later undermined by missionary influence.  \n  – \"Loa\" (long) in \"keiki ‘u‘uku loa\" may allude to the *loa* (spirit world) and the *ʻōpiʻopio* (young days), symbolizing the transition from ancestral to modern times.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97).
