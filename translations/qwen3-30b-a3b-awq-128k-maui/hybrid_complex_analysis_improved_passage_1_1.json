  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "• [Allegorical representation of lineage and divine authority]  \n  – The passage uses the term \"keiki ‘u‘uku loa\" (great fish child) to symbolize a figure of immense power and connection to the ocean, a central element in Hawaiian cosmology. The \"u‘uku\" (fish) is often linked to Mo‘ōpuna (progeny) of the gods, reflecting the sacredness of the sea in Hawaiian creation myths.  \n  – \"Ko koa loa\" (great koa) references the koa tree, sacred to the warrior class, suggesting the child embodies both spiritual and martial strength.  \n\n• [Analysis of character names and symbolism]  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o\" (Sea of the Child of the Pāo‘o). \"Nāmaka\" (sea) and \"pāo‘o\" (a name or term meaning \"to be silent\" or \"to rest\") may symbolize a guardian of the ocean’s mysteries or a mediator between divine and human realms.  \n  – **Kauluakaha‘i**: \"Kau-lu-akaha‘i\" (The one who breaks the path). \"Kau\" (to break) and \"lu\" (to cut) suggest a figure associated with transformation or challenging boundaries, possibly reflecting a leader who disrupts tradition for progress.  \n  – **Kahikipapaialewa**: \"Kahi-kapa-pa-i-lewa\" (The place of the chief’s breaking). \"Kahi\" (place) and \"papai\" (to break) may allude to a site of historical or ritual significance, such as a conflict between ali‘i (chief) and the kapu system.  \n\n• [Historical and cultural context: Pre-Contact to Post-Contact transitions]  \n  – The reference to \"ao‘ao akua kekahi ona\" (a certain divine law) points to the **‘Ai Kapu era** (the kapu system), which governed social and religious life before 1819. This aligns with the pre-contact period, where divine laws (‘ao‘ao akua) dictated resource management, social hierarchy, and rituals.  \n  – The mention of \"Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau\" (Hawaii to Niihau) highlights the **geographical duality** of the archipelago, symbolizing the balance between the Big Island (Hawaii) and the smaller, more isolated Ni‘ihau. This duality may reflect the tension between centralized power (Hawaii) and peripheral territories (Ni‘ihau) during the rise of the Māori dynasty.  \n  – The term \"ali‘i nui\" (great chief) underscores the **hierarchical structure** of Hawaiian society, where chiefs were seen as divine intermediaries. The narrative’s focus on lineage and land (\"he ‘āina\") may critique the rigidities of the kapu system, which were abolished in 1819, leading to shifts in power dynamics.  \n\n• [Numerical symbolism and social commentary]  \n  – \"‘a‘ohe ona lua\" (two islands) symbolizes the **duality of existence** (mo‘olelo) in Hawaiian cosmology, such as the union of land and sea or the balance between spiritual and temporal realms. This reflects the cultural emphasis on harmony (‘āina and moana).  \n  – The structure of the text with nested labels (a), b1), c), etc.) mirrors the **oral storytelling tradition**, where layered narratives conveyed moral and historical lessons. This could critique the erosion of traditional knowledge systems after 1820 due to missionary influence and Westernization.  \n  – The child’s \"ikaika loa\" (great strength) and \"ko koa loa\" (great koa) may allegorically represent the **resilience of Hawaiian sovereignty** against colonial pressures, with the koa tree symbolizing the warrior spirit that was later suppressed.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97).
