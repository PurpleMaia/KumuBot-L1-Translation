  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "The death of Puali‘i, Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to her homeland, to her mother's place, to Pōka‘ī, where she lived, the food of Nāmakaokapāo‘o was not for her. At that time, ‘Ama‘u was an ali‘i of O‘ahu, living in Waikīkī. Some people went from Honouliuli to Waikīkī to reside as the ali‘i. She spoke: “O ali‘i! There was a child of the ‘u‘uku who was very strong. Her father died and her head was cut off in the sea. It was a very deep place, five miles of depth. But for ‘Ama‘u, her strength was such that she died from it, so that she would not die from the strength. She spoke in Waikīkī, it was only Nāmakaokapāo‘o who said these words.”",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The text references key locations in O‘ahu (Waikīkī, Honouliuli, Lo‘ihi) and names like Puali‘i, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and ‘Ama‘u, which may relate to ancestral figures or mythic events. The dialogue highlights themes of strength, mortality, and the consequences of power, common in Hawaiian storytelling. The structure reflects traditional narrative techniques, including direct speech and symbolic descriptions of depth (“kai loa,” “lō‘ihi”), which could signify both literal and metaphorical significance. The mention of ‘u‘uku (mullet) and the tragic fate of the child underscores cultural values of respect for nature and the sacredness of ali‘i lineage.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
