Place the Nāmakaokapāo’o on top of the roof of the house, he was in the edge of the side and the edge, and he lies quietly at the edge of the roof.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>And then, he read to her, the mother, in the silence of the valley of Waipouli. Then the mother, then to their house in Keahumoa, she resides quietly. Place the Nāmakaokapāo’o on top of the roof of the house, he was in the edge of the side and the edge, and he lies quietly at the edge of the roof.</translation>  \n\n<commentary>This passage appears to be part of a traditional Hawaiian narrative, likely from a story involving familial or spiritual themes. The mention of specific place names like Waipouli and Keahumoa suggests a localized setting, possibly reflecting historical or mythological geography. The verbs \"lawe\" (to read/chant), \"noho\" (to reside), and \"pi’i\" (to place) indicate a sequence of actions, while the repetition of \"makuahine\" (mother) and the name \"Nāmakaokapāo’o\" (possibly a person’s name) highlight character roles. The phrase \"ma waena i luna pono o ke kaupoku\" (at the edge of the roof’s edge) may metaphorically or literally describe a sacred or transitional space, common in Hawaiian narratives where physical locations hold spiritual significance. The text’s archaic structure and vocabulary align with oral traditions or written accounts from the pre-modern era, emphasizing cultural and historical continuity.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
