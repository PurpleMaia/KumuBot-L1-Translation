  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "• [Allegorical interpretation of the passage: Rituals as a metaphor for cultural transformation]  \n  – The act of \"making a single coconut tree on top of another\" symbolizes the construction of social hierarchies or the blending of traditions during the 'Ai Kapu era (sacred kapu system). Coconut trees (‘uala) represent sustenance and spiritual connection, while their stacking suggests the interdependence of human and divine realms.  \n  – The \"eight coconut leaves\" (ehā ‘au o ka ‘uala) may allegorically reflect the eight directions of the universe (mo‘olele) in Hawaiian cosmology, a sacred number tied to navigation and spiritual balance (Kamakau, 1992). Burning them on a fire (ahi) could signify purification or the dissolution of old structures.  \n\n• [Symbolism of names: Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Pōka‘ī, Puali‘i]  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: Etymologically, \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o\" (the one who seeks the sea’s creation). \"Maka\" (sea) and \"pāo‘o\" (to create or build) suggest a connection to the ocean’s life-giving power, possibly representing the *mo‘o* (guardian spirits) of the sea or navigators.  \n  – **Pōka‘ī**: \"Pō-ka-‘ī\" (night’s eye or darkness of the eye). \"Pō\" (night) and \"ka‘ī\" (eye) may allude to the *mo‘o* (guardian of the night) or the hidden knowledge of the ancestors, contrasting with the \"light\" of new practices post-1820.  \n  – **Puali‘i**: \"Pua-li‘i\" (flower of the li‘i plant). \"Pua\" (flower) and \"li‘i\" (a type of sacred plant) symbolize fragility and sacredness, possibly reflecting the tension between traditional rituals and the encroaching influence of missionaries.  \n\n• [Historical context: 'Ai Kapu to post-1820 reforms]  \n  – The \"fire\" (ahi) and \"burning\" (‘ōhinu) may reference the *kūpaoa* (sacred fires) used in *kapu* rituals, which were abolished in 1819 after Kamehameha’s death. The act of burning \"eight coconut leaves\" could parallel the dismantling of kapu systems, where rituals were replaced by Christian practices.  \n  – The dialogue between Pōka‘ī and Puali‘i mirrors the conflict between traditionalists (\"‘A‘ole\") and those embracing Western influence (\"‘Ae\"). This reflects the post-1820 period’s social upheaval, as missionaries introduced new values, disrupting ancestral practices (Green, 1992).  \n\n• [Numerical symbolism: Eight as a sacred number]  \n  – The number \"eight\" (ehā) in Hawaiian culture represents the *mo‘olele* (directions) and the *kūmūho‘ā* (eight elements of the natural world), symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and the cosmos. The burning of eight leaves may allegorically signify the surrender of these elements to a new order, reflecting the loss of traditional knowledge.  \n  – The phrase \"the size of the two coconut trees is a measure\" (he kanahā āhua ka nui o nā māla ‘elua) could allude to the binary cosmology of *Māui* (the god of fishing and navigation) and *Hina* (the moon goddess), representing the duality of life and death, or the old and new worlds.  \n\n• [Cultural critique: The erosion of sacred practices]  \n  – The narrative critiques the erosion of *kapu* (sacred laws) through the metaphor of burning sacred objects (coconut leaves). The \"mother\" (makuahine) and \"father\" (makua kāne) may symbolize the dual forces of tradition and change, with the father’s action (descending to the fire) representing the collapse of ancestral authority.  \n  – The line \"on this day, he will be made\" (eia kona lā e make ai ia‘u) reflects the inevitability of cultural transformation, a theme tied to the post-1820 missionary influence that redefined Hawaiian identity and spirituality.",

  "reference_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \\[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;"
