  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "When he was there, Nāmakaokapāo‘o covered all the taro fields above and below, as well as the two taro plants on the sacred place. Thus, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went to the fire, burning the two taro plants on the sacred ground. Then, his male parent, the elder, went down, and he went to his mother. To Pōka‘ī: “No.” Puali‘i replied: “Yes, the head and the eyes of the thing that will eat my taro on this day, therefore, that day will make him.”",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "• [Allegorical interpretation of the passage]  \n  – The act of \"covering all the taro fields\" symbolizes the protection or concealment of sacred resources, reflecting the traditional Hawaiian concept of *kuleana* (responsibility) to preserve *kuleana* (rights) of the land. The two taro plants on the \"sacred place\" may represent the duality of life and death, or the balance between human and divine realms.  \n  – The dialogue between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and his parents mirrors the tension between *kapu* (sacred law) and *alii* (chiefly authority), a recurring theme in pre-contact Hawaiian narratives where decisions about sacred resources were often tied to spiritual and social hierarchies.  \n\n• [Analysis of character names and symbolism]  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: \"Nā\" (the), \"makahina\" (to be clear, to purify), \"pāo‘o\" (a place, possibly a name). The name may imply \"The Clearer of the Pāo‘o,\" where *pāo‘o* could symbolize a boundary or sacred space, suggesting a figure tasked with maintaining spiritual order.  \n  – **Pōka‘ī**: \"Pō\" (night, darkness), \"kā‘ī\" (to be still, to rest). The name may allude to the \"Stillness of Night,\" representing a moment of decision or moral ambiguity.  \n  – **Puali‘i**: \"Pua\" (flower, blossom), \"li‘i\" (to be small, to diminish). The name could symbolize \"The Diminishing Blossom,\" hinting at the erosion of traditional values or the fragility of cultural practices under external pressures.  \n\n• [Historical and cultural context]  \n  – The reference to \"sacred place\" (*kapuahi*) connects to the *Ai Kapu* era (pre-contact, 1819), where taro (*kalo*) was considered a *aumakua* (deity) and its cultivation was deeply spiritual. Burning taro plants might symbolize the disruption of sacred rituals or the collapse of the kapu system.  \n  – The numerical symbolism of \"two\" (*‘elua*) and \"head and eyes\" (*po‘o me nā maka*) reflects the Hawaiian cosmological concept of *mo‘okūauhau* (genealogical lineage) and the importance of *kūkulu* (structure) in maintaining social order. The dialogue may critique the erosion of traditional governance post-1820, as missionary influence introduced new values conflicting with *kapu*.  \n\n• [Social commentary and critique]  \n  – The conflict between Nāmakaokapāo‘o and his parents mirrors the societal upheaval during the *Ai Kapu* abolition (1819), where the destruction of sacred practices led to cultural dissonance. The \"head and eyes\" of the taro could allegorically represent the loss of cultural identity and spiritual vision.  \n  – The use of *ahi* (fire) as a metaphor for transformation or destruction highlights the tension between preservation and change, a theme central to post-contact Hawaiian history. The narrative may reflect anxieties about the future of *ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi* (Hawaiian language) and *loco iʻa* (traditional fishponds) under missionary influence.  \n\n• [Post-contact biases and narrative transitions]  \n  – The phrase \"that day will make him\" (*eia kona lā e make ai ia‘u*) may allude to the 1820s missionary arrival, which \"made\" (transformed) Hawaiian society. The passive construction (*e make ai*) could indicate a critique of how external forces imposed new systems, eroding indigenous autonomy.  \n  – The dialogue's ambiguity (\"No\" vs. \"Yes\") reflects the uncertainty of the era, where traditional *mo‘okūauhau* (genealogical) ties were challenged by Christian morality and Western concepts of ownership.",

  "reference_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \\[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;"
