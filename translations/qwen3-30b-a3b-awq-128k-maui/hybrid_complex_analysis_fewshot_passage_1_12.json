Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \n\"Equal to Ama'u, the chief from Waikīkī, the people of Kaua, there is a group of great people, such as all the people of Ehā. They went to the field of Keahumoa, they entered into the house, no one is there. Then they came back, a call was made by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o on the head. They listened to the voice, no one is aware of the head, they asked them: 'Where are you going now?' Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o replied: 'Only I am here.'

They replied: 'We are going to Kaua with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, a place of small children like you, strong and mighty. He alone was in the house of his father, Puali'i.'\"  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• This paragraph continues the narrative of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, emphasizing his role as a figure of contrast between traditional and progressive values. The mention of \"Kaua\" (Kaua Island) and \"Waikīkī\" (a district in Honolulu) situates the story in a specific geographic and cultural context. The phrase \"kula o Keahumoa\" (field of Keahumoa) may reference a sacred or ritual site, aligning with the 'Ai Kapu era's emphasis on land and spiritual boundaries.  \n– The repetition of \"Ehā ma ke kua o ka hale\" (Ehā at the head of the house) and \"alo o ka hale\" (head of the house) could symbolize the tension between communal leadership and individual authority, reflecting the hierarchical structure of Hawaiian society.  \n– \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o\" (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) is analyzed in prior examples as a metaphor for a child with symbolic \"eyes\" (maka) representing knowledge or vision. Here, the \"head\" (kua) of the house (hale) may allude to the physical and spiritual center of a household, where decisions were made.  \n• The dialogue \"He aha mai nei kā 'oukou o 'one'i?\" (\"What is this that you are looking for?\") echoes the theme of questioning traditional practices, a common motif in Hawaiian narratives during the 'Ai Kapu era, where rituals and taboos were scrutinized.  \n– \"Wahi keiki 'u'uku e like me 'oe\" (\"a place of small children like you\") may allegorically represent the younger generation challenging the old guard, with \"keiki\" (children) symbolizing future leaders and \"u'uku\" (a type of fish) possibly tied to ancestral deities.  \n– \"Puali'i\" (father) is likely a reference to a deity or high priest, as \"pua\" (flower) and \"li'i\" (lineage) often denote sacred or royal heritage. The phrase \"he ikaika a me ke koa loa\" (\"strong and mighty\") underscores Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's unique status as both a child and a symbol of power.  \n• The structure of the paragraph mirrors earlier examples, with a focus on naming conventions, geographic specificity, and symbolic conflict between human and divine forces. The absence of people in the house (\"a'ohe kanaka\") may reflect the collapse of traditional structures or the isolation of a visionary.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
