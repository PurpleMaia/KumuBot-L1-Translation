  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>He said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: \"I know that Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great man, and he went to Ko'olau, and your name is his.\" They replied: \"No, it is you.

The dialogue reflects a conflict or confrontation, possibly between warriors or between the living and the supernatural. The mention of \"loa\" (the underworld) and \"make\" (death) ties to Hawaiian cosmology, where the afterlife is a central theme. The structure of the text, with direct speech and action verbs like \"hakakā ai\" (to fight), suggests an oral tradition narrative emphasizing valor and fate. The repetition of names and the use of \"e\" in phrases like \"e make ana\" (you will die) highlight the grammatical causative structure, common in Hawaiian for expressing obligation or destiny. The reference to \"āha'ilono\" (council) may allude to a gathering of deities or ancestral spirits, underscoring the cultural significance of councils in decision-making and spiritual matters.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
