  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**  \n• This passage follows the traditional Hawaiian storytelling structure of introducing names, their familial roles, and their significance within a cultural or spiritual framework. The phrase “ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki” (In the land of small words) may allude to the concept of “mele” (songs, poetry) or “ʻōlelo” (language) as a sacred medium, with “ane‘i” possibly referencing a specific locality or metaphorical space.  \n– **Nāmakaokalani** (Eyes of the heavens): The name combines *nā maka* (eyes) with *ka lani* (the sky/upper realm), suggesting a connection to celestial deities or the spiritual domain.  \n– **Nāmakaokai‘a** (Eyes of the fish): The name *i‘a* (fish) ties to oceanic symbolism, while *nā maka* (eyes) may reflect the importance of vision or perception in Hawaiian cosmology.  \n– **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (Eyes of the pāo‘o): The suffix *pāo‘o* (a type of fish, possibly *Echeneis* or remora) links to the earlier names, creating a triadic relationship. The act of “being placed in the prayer” (*ua komo i loko o ka pule*) could signify ritual inclusion, blessing, or spiritual consecration.  \n• The familial relationship (“makua kāne” father, “keiki” child) emphasizes lineage and hierarchy, common in Hawaiian genealogies. Nāmakaokalani as the father and Nāmakaokai‘a as the child may symbolize the transmission of power or divine authority.  \n• The reference to “ali‘i nui lāua” (great chiefs of Hawai‘i) highlights their high social status, aligning with the *mo‘okūau* (genealogical lines) of powerful *ali‘i* (chiefs) in Hawaiian history.  \n• Allegorically, the repetition of *nā maka* (eyes) in the names may represent the dual focus of *alii* on both the spiritual (*lani*) and material (*i‘a*) realms, reflecting the balance between celestial and earthly domains. The “prayer” (*pule*) could symbolize a ritual act of protection or empowerment, tying the individuals to the divine.  \n• The name *pāo‘o* (fish) may also connect to the myth of *Kāne* (god of creation) or *Kāne‘o* (a deity associated with the ocean), suggesting the child’s ties to marine life and ancestral deities.",

  "reference_translation": "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity."
