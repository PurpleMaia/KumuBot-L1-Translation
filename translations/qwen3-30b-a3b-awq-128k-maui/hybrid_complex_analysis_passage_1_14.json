  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "A lohe of Ama'u, he was a guardian of his war canoes, which were a lineage of the kumamāwalu. He went down to Ewa, and was with Namakaokapāo'o. Ama'u was also with his people in Ewa, who were taken by Namakaokapāo'o in the great luku, 'a'ohe kanaka koe, and Ama'u was destroyed. This O'ahu was also under Namakaokapāo'o. Then, he was captured by his wife and was placed on the land of O'ahu.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>A lohe of Ama'u, he was a guardian of his war canoes, which were a lineage of the kumamāwalu. He went down to Ewa, and was with Namakaokapāo'o. Ama'u was also with his people in Ewa, who were taken by Namakaokapāo'o in the great luku, 'a'ohe kanaka koe, and Ama'u was destroyed. This O'ahu was also under Namakaokapāo'o. Then, he was captured by his wife and was placed on the land of O'ahu.</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• [Main interpretive point about the passage]  \n  – The passage reflects a conflict between traditional Hawaiian power structures and external forces, symbolizing the erosion of sovereignty during the post-1820 missionary era.  \n  – The destruction of Ama'u and his people mirrors the collapse of the kapu system (1819) and the destabilization of ali’i (noble) authority under foreign influence.  \n\n• [Analysis of character names or symbolism]  \n  – **Ama'u**: From *ama* (to guard/protect) + *u* (suffix denoting a place or state), suggesting a guardian or protector figure.  \n  – **Namakaokapāo'o**: *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o* (eyes of the two), referencing the dual vision of a leader or deity, possibly symbolizing a figure with foresight or divine authority.  \n  – **Kumamāwalu**: *Kuma* (to endure) + *māwalu* (to be strong), implying a lineage of resilience or strength, contrasting with the \"great luku\" (destruction) later in the text.  \n\n• [Historical or cultural context point]  \n  – **Ai Kapu era (pre-1819)**: The narrative may allude to the rigid social hierarchy and religious practices of the kapu system, which were abolished in 1819, leading to societal upheaval.  \n  – **Missionary influence (post-1820)**: The phrase \"e noke mai ana 'o Namakaokapāo'o\" (taken by Namakaokapāo'o) could symbolize the imposition of foreign values, as missionaries later dismantled traditional practices.  \n  – **Ewa and O'ahu**: Ewa, a district on O'ahu, was historically significant for its resources and strategic location. The \"placement on the land of O'ahu\" might signify the loss of autonomy or the integration of local governance under foreign rule.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
