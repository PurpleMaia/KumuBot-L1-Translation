  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "Ama'u, taking care of his canoes, was a company of warriors, and went down to Ewa with Nāmakaokapāo'o. Ama'u arrived with his people in Ewa, for Nāmakaokapāo'o was carried throughout the land, 'you are not a person,' and Ama'u died. Then, the island of O'ahu was given to Nāmakaokapāo'o, and at that time, he gazed at his wife and laid her on the land of O'ahu.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>Ama'u, taking care of his canoes, was a company of warriors, and went down to Ewa with Nāmakaokapāo'o. Ama'u arrived with his people in Ewa, for Nāmakaokapāo'o was carried throughout the land, 'you are not a person,' and Ama'u died. Then, the island of O'ahu was given to Nāmakaokapāo'o, and at that time, he gazed at his wife and laid her on the land of O'ahu.</translation>\n\n<commentary>This passage appears to be part of a traditional Hawaiian narrative, likely a legend or historical account, concerning the distribution of land, leadership, or cultural practices. The names 'Ama'u and Nāmakaokapāo'o may refer to ancestral figures or deities, while references to canoes, warriors, and territorial claims align with Hawaiian oral traditions about migration, conquest, and resource management. The phrase \"e noke mai ana\" (to be carried) and \"ki'i akula\" (gazed) suggest symbolic or ritualistic actions, possibly reflecting the sacredness of land and ancestral connections. The structure and vocabulary are consistent with older Hawaiian texts, emphasizing genealogical and geographic relationships.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
