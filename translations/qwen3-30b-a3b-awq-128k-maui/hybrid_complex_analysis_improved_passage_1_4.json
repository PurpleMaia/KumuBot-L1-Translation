  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "• The passage reflects the transition from the traditional kapu system to post-contact societal changes, symbolizing the collapse of religious and social hierarchies.  \n  – The \"Ai Kapu era\" (pre-1819) emphasizes rigid structures, while the mention of \"noa\" (freedom) and \"iho akula\" (to go) suggests a shift toward new practices under missionary influence after 1820.  \n  – The abandonment of kapu in 1819, as documented by Kamakau (1992), mirrors the narrative’s depiction of leaving behind old systems.  \n\n• Symbolism of \"Puali‘i\" and \"Pōka‘ī\" as allegorical figures.  \n  – \"Puali‘i\": \"Pua\" (flower) + \"li\" (to be, to become), suggesting \"the one who becomes the flower of the sea\" or a deity of the ocean.  \n  – \"Pōka‘ī\": \"Pō\" (night) + \"ka‘ī\" (to be), symbolizing \"the rest of the night\" or a figure tied to cyclical time, reflecting the interplay between human and divine in Hawaiian cosmology.  \n\n• The name \"Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" as a metaphor for resource management and cultural identity.  \n  – \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o\": \"Nā\" (plural) + \"maka\" (eye, as in \"mālama\" [care] and \"maka\" [eye] as a symbol of observation.  \n  – \"Ka-pāo‘o\" (the place of the pāo‘o, a type of fish or a term for a boundary marker) may signify the intersection of land and sea, highlighting the importance of resource boundaries in traditional Hawaiian governance.  \n\n• The act of \"catching fish and taro\" at Honouliuli’s sea critiques the shift from agricultural to maritime subsistence.  \n  – Honouliuli, a historically significant fishpond area, represents the integration of traditional aquaculture with new practices under foreign influence.  \n  – The phrase \"lawai‘a i i‘a ‘ai pū me ka ‘uala\" (to catch fish and taro) may allegorically depict the tension between land-based (taro as sacred staple) and sea-based (fish as alternative sustenance) resource systems.  \n\n• The \"two taro fields\" as a numerical symbol of duality in Hawaiian cosmology.  \n  – The number two often signifies balance (e.g., male/female, land/sea) in Hawaiian thought, aligning with the kapu system’s emphasis on harmony.  \n  – The abandonment of these fields in 1819 could symbolize the dissolution of traditional land divisions, as missionaries introduced new agricultural models.  \n\n• The role of \"kapa ‘ia ka inoa\" (named) in cultural memory.  \n  – Naming practices in Hawaiian tradition (e.g., \"Namakaokapāo‘o\") encode ancestral and ecological knowledge.  \n  – The persistence of such names in post-contact narratives may reflect efforts to preserve indigenous identity amid foreign influence, as seen in the work of Kuykendall (1953).",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
