And the taro spoke, the words of Puali‘i in his own tongue: “Here is the head of the ulua (eel) and the taro, and Puali‘i's food, and then, free, his wife's food, Pōka‘ī and other things.” Thus, Puali‘i went to the sea of Honouliuli and caught fish for the taro.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "• The passage reflects a transition from traditional Hawaiian agricultural and spiritual practices to post-contact social changes  \n  – The mention of taro (kalo) fields and rituals ties to the sacred kalo cultivation system, central to Hawaiian subsistence and cosmology (Kamehameha’s conquest and the ‘Ai Kapu era, 1819).  \n  – The name “Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o” (The Eyes of the Chief) symbolizes the hierarchical relationship between land, resources, and leadership, with the taro fields as both physical and spiritual entities.  \n\n• Symbolism of “kālua” (eel) and “kalo” (taro) as dual sacred symbols  \n  – “Kālua” (ulua) represents Kanaloa, the god of the ocean and fertility, while “kalo” is the sacred ancestor of the Hawaiian people (Malo, 1951).  \n  – The dialogue attributed to the taro (“Here is the head of the ulua and the taro”) may allegorically signify the unity of land and sea in Hawaiian cosmology, where kalo (land) and ulua (sea) are intertwined in resource management.  \n\n• Etymology and allegorical meanings of names  \n  – **Puali‘i**: “Pau” (to finish, conclude) + “li‘i” (to be, to exist). Symbolizes a leader who brings closure to a system or establishes a new order.  \n  – **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o**: “Nā” (the), “maka” (eyes), “o” (of), “ka-pāo‘o” (chief, from *pā‘o*—to rule, to lead). Represents the “Eyes of the Chief,” suggesting the fields as sacred extensions of the ali‘i (chief) who oversees them.  \n  – **Pōka‘ī**: A name possibly linked to “pō” (night, darkness) and “kā‘ī” (to scatter, to distribute). May symbolize the redistribution of resources or the cyclical nature of life and death.  \n\n• Historical context: Post-1820 missionary influence and the collapse of ‘Ai Kapu  \n  – The “Ai Kapu” (food taboo) system, abolished in 1819, governed resource access and social hierarchy. The phrase “noa” (free) in the dialogue may allude to the post-1819 reforms, which dismantled kapu restrictions, enabling commoners to eat taro freely.  \n  – The reference to Puali‘i’s actions—fishing for taro—could critique the disruption of traditional agricultural practices by post-contact economic shifts, such as commercial fishing or missionary-driven land reforms.  \n\n• Numerical symbolism and the role of “elua” (two)  \n  – “Elua āna mau māla ‘uala lō‘ihi” (two of the taro fields of Lō‘ihi) may signify duality in Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., male/female, land/sea), but also the fragmentation of land after Western contact.  \n  – The number “two” could also allude to the twin gods of the Mo‘ohala (the twin deities of the sea and land), reflecting the tension between traditional resource stewardship and colonial exploitation.  \n\n• Social commentary on gender and resource distribution  \n  – The mention of Puali‘i’s wife and “Pōka‘ī” may hint at shifting gender roles under missionary influence, where female leadership in agriculture was diminished.  \n  – The phrase “‘ai kāna wahine, Pōka‘ī a me nā mea ‘ē a‘e” (his wife’s food, Pōka‘ī and other things) could allegorically represent the marginalization of women’s roles in post-contact society, contrasting with pre-contact matriarchal systems.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
