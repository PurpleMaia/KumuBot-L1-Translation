They replied: 'No, you are the one, so our words, therefore, you will die, you will not live.' Nāmakaokapāo'o said: 'Return and rest.' Then they went down to rest, but Nāmakaokapāo'o became a burden, completely destroyed the sweet potato, and you (singular) became one person, that is the 'Ama'u of the sea in Waikīkī, speaking to the sweet potato of them all, and you (singular) in the land of 'Āha'ilono to search for 'Ama'u.\"",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \n\"Then Nāmakaokapāo'o said: 'I know, Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great man, and he has gone to Ko'olau, and that is his name.' They replied: 'No, you are the one, so our words, therefore, you will die, you will not live.' Nāmakaokapāo'o said: 'Return and rest.'

The dialogue reflects a conflict or confrontation, likely tied to cultural or spiritual themes;  \n– **Nāmakaokapāo'o** (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, \"the eyes of the pāo'o fish\"): The name retains its symbolic connection to \"maka\" (eyes) and \"pāo'o\" (a type of fish), reinforcing his association with the \"Ai Kapu\" tradition, where \"pāo'o\" could represent a sacred or symbolic entity;  \n– **Ko'olau** (Ko'olau, a mountain on O'ahu): The reference to Ko'olau as a place of significance may allude to its historical role as a site of spiritual or territorial importance, where Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions (e.g., destroying sweet potato patches) challenge traditional practices;  \n• The phrase \"pau loa i ka make\" (completely destroyed the sweet potato) mirrors earlier symbolic actions in the text, where sweet potatoes (‘uala) are tied to ritual and sustenance. Here, the destruction of 'uala may allegorically represent the dismantling of 'Ai Kapu practices, as seen in previous examples (e.g., Paragraph 6);  \n– **'Ama'u ma Waikīkī** (Ama'u of the sea in Waikīkī): \"Ama'u\" (to search or seek) is linked to the name \"Ama'u,\" a deity associated with the ocean and navigation, suggesting a metaphorical connection to the \"Ai Kapu\" era’s reliance on sacred resources;  \n– **'Āha'ilono** (Ā-ha-i-lono, \"the place of searching\" or \"the land of inquiry\"): This could symbolize a transition from ritualistic practices to a more secular or progressive mindset, as seen in the story’s broader themes of abandoning 'Ai Kapu;  \n• The dialogue \"e make ana 'oe iā mākou, 'a'ole 'oe e ola\" (\"you will die, you will not live\") reflects the harsh consequences of violating 'Ai Kapu laws, where certain actions (e.g., destroying sacred crops) were considered taboo and punishable by death;  \n– The repetition of \"make\" (kill) and \"ola\" (live) underscores the binary of life and death in the 'Ai Kapu system, where spiritual transgressions had dire outcomes;  \n• The instruction \"Ho'i aku ho'okākā i lalo e hakakā ai\" (\"Return and rest\") may allude to the need for reconciliation or ritual purification, as \"hakā\" (to rest) could imply a return to balance or harmony in the cultural framework;  \n– The act of \"koe aku ho'okahi kanaka\" (\"you become one person\") may symbolize the merging of identities or the erasure of individuality under the weight of cultural obligations, a recurring theme in stories about resistance to 'Ai Kapu.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
