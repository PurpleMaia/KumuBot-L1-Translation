Puli'i approached Pōka‘ī and asked him, saying: 'I will ask you for a wife.' Pōka‘ī replied: 'How will you ask me for a wife? I have children, and my son is grown.' Puli'i replied: 'These things are not good, you ask me for a wife, let us sleep together.' Pōka‘ī agreed. Then Pōka‘ī returned with his husband and Puli'i to the field of Keahumoa, to stay.\"",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "• **Paragraph 3:**  \n  – The passage introduces the protagonist **Puli'i** (Puli‘i), a \"good person\" (kanaka maika‘i) from **Līhu‘e** (Lihue), a region on the island of O‘ahu. His location is specified as \"in the area of Honouliuli's coast\" (i ka lawai‘a ma kai o Honouliuli), indicating a geographic setting tied to specific land divisions.  \n  – **Pōka‘ī** (Pokai) is identified as the host (kipa maila ia ma ka hale o Pōka‘ī), suggesting a familial or communal relationship. The phrase \"a guest in the house of Pokai\" implies a temporary or ritualistic stay, possibly reflecting traditional hospitality (aloha ‘āina) or a sacred context.  \n  – The dialogue between Puli'i and Pokai revolves around a marriage proposal (makemake iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u), which is a central cultural practice (ho‘oika‘i) in Hawaiian society. Pokai’s refusal (\"I have children, and my son is grown\") may allude to the **Ai Kapu** era’s restrictions on marriage, where lineage and status were strictly maintained, and daughters might not be available for union until their father’s obligations were fulfilled.  \n  – Puli'i’s response (\"He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua\") contains metaphorical language. The phrase \"e moe kāua\" (let us sleep together) could symbolize a union (marriage) or a deeper spiritual bond, while \"he mea ‘ole ia mau mea\" (these things are not good) may critique the rigidity of traditional practices or foreshadow conflict.  \n  – The mention of **Keahumoa** (Keahumoa) as the destination for \"to stay\" (noho) suggests a place of significance, possibly a sacred site (heiau) or a symbolic threshold between worlds. The name \"Keahumoa\" might derive from **kea** (white, pure) and **humoa** (a term possibly linked to \"humoa\" meaning \"to rest\" or \"to dwell,\" reflecting a place of settlement or spiritual refuge).  \n  – The structure mirrors Hawaiian narrative conventions of introducing characters through their origins, relationships, and symbolic actions. Puli'i’s journey to Pokai’s house and the subsequent dialogue may allegorically represent the tension between traditional values (Ai Kapu) and emerging social changes, such as the breakdown of rigid hierarchies during the **Māori colonization** or **post-contact era**.  \n  – **Cultural context:** The term \"maka‘ole\" (not good) in Puli'i’s reply could symbolize the rejection of **kapu** (sacred laws) or the clash between old and new ways. The phrase \"e moe kāua\" (let us sleep together) might allude to **māmā** (to lie with, to be intimate), a verb often used in poetic or metaphorical contexts to signify union, both literal and symbolic.  \n  – **Allegorical interpretation:** The narrative may reflect the struggle between **ho‘oika‘i** (marriage alliances) and **kapu** (sacred restrictions). Puli'i’s insistence on \"sleeping together\" despite Pokai’s refusal could symbolize the erosion of traditional social structures, akin to the **Māori** (a term for a person from the moon, often linked to celestial or spiritual themes) or the **Hawaiian concept of 'āina** (land) as a living entity requiring balance. The \"field of Keahumoa\" might represent a metaphorical space for renewal or transformation, aligning with the **māla** (garden) as a symbol of sustenance and cultural continuity.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
