At that time, Ama‘u was an ali‘i of O‘ahu, in Waikīkī, where she lived, some people went from Honouliuli to Waikīkī to live with the ali‘i. She spoke: “O the ali‘i! A very strong son of a chief, was killed, and his head was severed in the ocean, a very deep place, five miles the depth.” Alohe of Ama‘u, there was strength and death in her, therefore, in her, there was death without strength. To her, she spoke in Waikīkī, it was Nāmakaokapāo‘o who spoke these words.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nIt was the death of Puali‘i, then the death of Nāmakaokapāo‘o was at the side of her mother, to Pōka‘ī, they were living, there was no food for Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the food. At that time, Ama‘u was an ali‘i of O‘ahu, in Waikīkī, where she lived, some people went from Honouliuli to Waikīkī to live with the ali‘i. She spoke: “O the ali‘i!

To her, she spoke in Waikīkī, it was Nāmakaokapāo‘o who spoke these words.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• [Allegorical interpretation of death and power dynamics]  \n  – The passage uses \"make\" (death) and \"kiola\" (to sever) to symbolize the collapse of traditional power structures, reflecting the vulnerability of ali‘i (nobility) during the 'Ai Kapu era.  \n  – The \"five-mile depth\" (‘elima mile ka lō‘ihi) may allegorically represent the inescapable consequences of violating kapu (sacred laws), as the ocean’s depth signifies a realm beyond human reach.  \n\n• [Symbolism of names and their cultural context]  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o\" (the sea of the pāo‘o), where \"pāo‘o\" (a type of fish) may symbolize a guardian spirit or a metaphor for a lost lineage.  \n  – **Pōka‘ī**: \"Pō-ka-‘ī\" (night of the eye), suggesting a hidden or mysterious force, possibly tied to ancestral spirits or the afterlife.  \n  – **Ama‘u**: \"Ama-‘u\" (mother of the ‘u), where \"‘u\" (a type of breadfruit) could symbolize sustenance or the earth’s fertility, contrasting with the \"death without strength\" motif.  \n\n• [Historical and cultural context: 'Ai Kapu and post-1820 transitions]  \n  – The reference to \"no food for Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the food\" (‘a‘ohe ‘ai o Nāmakaokapāo‘o i ka ‘ai) may allude to the rigid 'Ai Kapu (food taboos) system, where access to resources was restricted to ali‘i.  \n  – The movement from Honouliuli to Waikīkī reflects pre-contact migration patterns and the centralization of power, later disrupted by missionary influence post-1820.  \n\n• [Numerical symbolism and riddles]  \n  – \"Five miles\" (‘elima mile) as a metaphor for the \"five elements\" (kupu, loko, moe, moana, and ‘āina) in Hawaiian cosmology, emphasizing the depth of loss or the inescapable nature of fate.  \n  – \"Head severed in the ocean\" (kiola ‘ia kona po‘o i kai loa) may symbolize the severing of a chief’s mana (spiritual power), a common theme in Hawaiian narratives about the fall of ali‘i.  \n\n• [Social commentary on ali‘i and kapu]  \n  – The phrase \"death without strength\" (i ‘ole au e make iā ia) critiques the fragility of ali‘i authority, suggesting that even powerful figures could be undone by external forces (e.g., foreign influence, internal strife).  \n  – The narrative mirrors the 1819 abolition of the 'Ai Kapu, where the rigid social order was shattered, leading to the loss of traditional practices and the rise of new hierarchies under missionary influence.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
