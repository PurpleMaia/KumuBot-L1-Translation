  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "Puali‘i died, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother's place, to Pōka‘ī, where they stayed. There was no food for Nāmakaokapāo‘o in that place. At that time, ‘Ama‘u was the chief of O‘ahu. In Waikīkī, he lived. Some people went from Honouliuli to Waikīkī to live the chief. He said: “O chief! There was a very strong child of ‘u‘uku. His father died, and his head was buried in the sea. It was a very deep place, a depth of five miles. But the place of ‘Ama‘u, there was strength and he died there. Therefore, he died there without strength. He spoke in Waikīkī. Only Nāmakaokapāo‘o was said in these words.”",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The text includes names of individuals (Puali‘i, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, ‘Ama‘u) and locations (Waikīkī, Honouliuli, Pōka‘ī), which are significant in Hawaiian cultural and historical contexts. The dialogue and references to 'u‘uku (a type of fish, often associated with the ocean deity Kanaloa) and the \"depth of five miles\" reflect metaphorical or hyperbolic language common in Hawaiian storytelling, emphasizing the vastness of the sea or the afterlife. The structure, with its use of \"iā\" (to/for) and \"e\" (to be) for emphasis, aligns with traditional oral narratives, where such particles highlight key elements. The mention of \"lō‘ihi\" (deep) and \"mile\" (mila) as a unit of measurement underscores the blending of indigenous and introduced concepts in Hawaiian texts.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
