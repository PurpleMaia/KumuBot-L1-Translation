At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, was living in Waikīkī, a place to live. A person from Honouliuli came to Waikīkī to live with the chief. He spoke: 'O chief! A very strong little boy, his father was dead and his head was cut off in the sea, a very high place, fifty miles the height.' About ‘Ama‘u, there was his strength and his death, so, I will kill him because there is no stronger one. He spoke in Waikīkī, the words were about Nāmakaokapāo‘o.\"",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\"It was Puali'i who died, and Nāmakaokapāo'o returned to his mother, Pōka'ī, and they lived together. There was no food for Nāmakaokapāo'o in the food.

He spoke in Waikīkī, the words were about Nāmakaokapāo‘o.\"</translation>\n\n<commentary>  \n• This paragraph continues the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo'o's life after Puali'i's death, emphasizing the absence of sustenance (\"‘a‘ohe ‘ai o Nāmakaokapāo'o i ka ‘ai\") and the symbolic link between his survival and the collapse of traditional practices like 'Ai Kapu, where food was restricted and rituals governed resource use;  \n– The phrase \"ua kiola ‘ia kona po‘o i kai loa\" (\"his head was cut off in the sea\") may allude to a ritualistic act of severing a symbolic \"head\" (po‘o) of the land or a person, reflecting the severing of ancestral ties or the destruction of sacred symbols during the transition from 'Ai Kapu to Western practices;  \n• The name ‘Ama‘u (a chief of O‘ahu) is tied to Waikīkī, a historically significant area associated with royal and spiritual practices. The mention of a visitor from Honouliuli (a district in 'Ewa, O'ahu) highlights the interconnectedness of Hawaiian communities and the role of chiefs in overseeing resources;  \n– \"‘Elima mile ka lō‘ihi\" (\"fifty miles the height\") could symbolize a sacred or metaphorical measurement, possibly referencing the \"height\" of a chief's power or the spiritual elevation of a place, with \"mile\" (miles) as a poetic exaggeration for vastness;  \n• The dialogue \"I will kill him because there is no stronger one\" reflects the cultural tension between Nāmakaokapāo'o's strength (symbolized by his \"ikaika,\" \"i.e., 'strong' or 'mighty') and the traditional 'Ai Kapu era, where strength was often tied to divine favor and ritual. The act of \"kiola\" (cutting off the head) may allegorically represent the dismantling of old customs, as seen in earlier paragraphs where Nāmakaokapāo'o's destructive actions symbolized the end of 'Ai Kapu;  \n– The repetition of \"kai loa\" (sea) and \"lō‘ihi loa\" (height) reinforces the theme of the ocean as a boundary between the sacred and the profane, and the \"height\" as a metaphor for spiritual or social status, aligning with the earlier allegory of Nāmakaokapāo'o's destructive power over the land's resources;  \n• The final line about 'Ama‘u's words being \"about Nāmakaokapāo'o\" suggests a continuation of the symbolic conflict, where Nāmakaokapāo'o's strength and defiance of 'Ai Kapu practices are contrasted with the lingering influence of traditional power structures, as represented by 'Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu. This underscores the story's allegorical critique of cultural change and the struggle between old and new paradigms.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
