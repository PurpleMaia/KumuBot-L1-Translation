  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Symbolizes a figure associated with the ocean's depths or the \"rear\" of societal structures, possibly representing the unseen forces of tradition.]  \n  – [Ama'u: A deity or ancestral figure linked to the ocean, often tied to navigation and spiritual realms. \"Ama'u\" may derive from *ama* (to seek/ask) + *u* (to be in motion), suggesting a \"seeker of the sea\" or a guide through spiritual waters.]  \n\n• [Historical and cultural symbolism]  \n  – [The reference to Ko'olau (a mountain on O'ahu) and Waikīkī (a sacred place) situates the story within a landscape of ritual and power, reflecting the *ʻāina* (land) as a living entity in Hawaiian cosmology.]  \n  – [The phrase \"pau loa i ka make\" (\"he is dead\") may allegorically signify the end of the 'Ai Kapu system (1819), where societal structures collapsed after Kamehameha's death, mirroring the \"death\" of traditional practices under missionary influence (post-1820).]  \n  – [The conflict between \"kākou\" (we) and \"oe\" (you) highlights the tension between ali’i (chiefs) and maka’ainana (commoners), a theme in post-contact narratives where Western influence disrupted indigenous governance.]  \n\n• [Numerical symbolism and riddles]  \n  – [\"Ho'i aku ho'i hā\" (return, return) repeats the verb *ho'ike* (to return), suggesting cyclical patterns of conflict and renewal in Hawaiian history, akin to the *mālama ʻāina* (caring for the land) philosophy.]  \n  – [\"Ho'okahi kanaka\" (one person) may symbolize the individual's struggle against collective forces, reflecting the vulnerability of traditional leaders during the 1820s when missionaries introduced new social norms.]  \n\n• [Social commentary and critique]  \n  – [The passage critiques the rigidity of kapu enforcement, where even a \"great man\" like Nāmakaokapāo'o is not spared, foreshadowing the 1819 abolition of kapu by Kamehameha II, which destabilized the old order.]  \n  – [The mention of \"loa'a 'o Ama'u\" (the one who went to Ama'u) may allegorically reference the loss of sacred knowledge, as missionaries later suppressed traditional practices, leading to the erosion of oral histories.]  \n</commentary>",

So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
