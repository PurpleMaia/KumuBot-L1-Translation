  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nHe replied to Nāmakaokapāo'o: \"I know, he is a great man, and he went to Ko'olau, and your name is that.\"  \nThey replied: \"No, you alone, such is our talk, now, you will die among us, you will not live.\"  \nHe said to them: \"Return, return, we go down to make a decision.\"  \nThey went down, and they killed Nāmakaokapāo'o, finished with the death, and they took one person, that is the one who went to and found 'Ama'u in Waikīkī, spoke to the death of them all, and they to the gathering to find 'Ama'u.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• [Main interpretive point about the passage]  \n  – [This passage reflects a tension between traditional Hawaiian values and the societal upheaval following the 1819 abolition of the kapu system, symbolizing the collapse of old hierarchies and the imposition of new power structures.]  \n  – [The dialogue and actions mirror the conflict between aliʻi (chiefly) authority and the emerging influence of missionaries, as seen in post-1820 cultural transitions.]  \n\n• [Analysis of character names or symbolism]  \n  – [Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o: \"Nā\" (the), \"maka\" (eye/opening), \"o\" (possessive), \"ka-pāo'o\" (the paddle). The name could allegorically represent \"the one who opens the way\" or \"the leader who guides,\" tying to navigational expertise (pāoʻo as a canoe paddle).]  \n  – [Ama'u: \"Ama\" (to rest/remain still), \"u\" (a suffix). Symbolizes \"stillness\" or \"rest,\" possibly reflecting the inevitability of death or the end of a cycle, aligning with Hawaiian cosmology where death is a return to the gods.]  \n\n• [Historical or cultural context point]  \n  – [The Ai Kapu era (pre-1819) emphasized strict social and religious codes, but the 1819 abolition by Kamehameha II dismantled these, leading to societal reorganization. This narrative may critique the erosion of traditional governance.]  \n  – [The reference to Waikīkī, a historically significant area for royal gatherings, underscores the displacement of cultural practices. The act of \"going down to make a decision\" (hoʻi aku hoʻi hā) parallels the ritual of *ʻiliʻili* (consultation) but may hint at the loss of such practices under missionary influence.]  \n\n• [Numerical symbolism and riddles]  \n  – [\"Ho'i aku ho'i hā\" (return, return) – the repetition of \"hoʻi\" (return) may symbolize the cyclical nature of Hawaiian *moʻokūauhau* (genealogy) or the inevitability of fate, while \"hā\" (two) could reflect the duality of life and death in Hawaiian philosophy.]  \n  – [\"pau loa\" (finished with the death) – \"pau\" (end) and \"loa\" (long), suggesting a prolonged or irreversible conclusion, mirroring the irreversible changes after 1819.]  \n\n• [Social commentary and critique]  \n  – [The dialogue \"e make ana 'oe iā mākou\" (\"you will die among us\") critiques the loss of autonomy for aliʻi and the imposition of foreign religious and political systems, which often led to the persecution of traditional leaders.]  \n  – [The name \"Nāmakaokapāo'o\" (sea-like) may symbolize a connection to the ocean, a central element of Hawaiian identity, while \"Ama'u\" (stillness) represents the inescapable end of such ties under colonial pressures.]  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
