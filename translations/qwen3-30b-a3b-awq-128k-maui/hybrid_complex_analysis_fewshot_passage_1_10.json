At that time, ‘Ama‘u was the chief of O‘ahu, in Waikīkī where he resided, and he sent someone to Honouliuli from Waikīkī to reside as the chief. He spoke: \"O chief! A little boy who was very strong, his father is dead and his head was cut off in the sea, a very sacred place, five miles the sacred place.

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nIt was Puali‘i who took Nāmakaokapāo‘o back to his mother, Pōka‘ī, to live in the village, and there was no food for Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u was the chief of O‘ahu, in Waikīkī where he resided, and he sent someone to Honouliuli from Waikīkī to reside as the chief. He spoke: \"O chief!

He spoke in Waikīkī, the words of Nāmakaokapāo‘o are these.\"  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n**Paragraph 10:** • This paragraph continues the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s story, emphasizing the consequences of his destructive behavior and the sacredness of locations tied to the 'Ai Kapu era, where land and resources were governed by strict rituals; • The names and places include: 1) **Puali‘i** (possibly \"Puli-i,\" meaning \"to take/carry\" or a name with no direct translation); 2) **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (literally \"the eyes of the pāo‘o fish,\" a metaphor for strength, echoing the first example’s \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o\" as a poetic reference to \"po‘o\" [head]); 3) **Pōka‘ī** (mother’s name; \"pō\" [night] and \"ka‘ī\" [possibly \"to dwell\" or \"to stay,\" suggesting a connection to darkness or secrecy); 4) **‘Ama‘u** (chief of O‘ahu; \"ama\" [to be heavy/oppressive] and \"au\" [suffix], possibly symbolizing authority or burden); 5) **Honouliuli** (a place in O‘ahu, historically significant for its sacred or agricultural role); 6) **Waikīkī** (a place in O‘ahu, central to Hawaiian history and governance).  \n– The term **lō‘ihi** (sacred place) reflects the 'Ai Kapu era’s emphasis on *kapu* (sacred restrictions), where certain areas were deemed spiritually potent and required ritual protection. The phrase \"ua kiola ‘ia kona po‘o i kai loa\" (his head was cut off in the sea) may symbolize a severing of spiritual or ancestral ties, with \"kiola\" (to cut off) evoking the concept of *kiola* as a verb for ritualistic dismemberment or metaphorical loss of power.  \n– The reference to \"five miles the sacred place\" (‘elima mile ka lō‘ihi) likely uses the number **five** (‘elima) symbolically, as in the first example, to denote a significant distance or esoteric meaning. The repetition of \"lō‘ihi\" (sacred) underscores the sanctity of the location, which in the 'Ai Kapu system, was tied to the *kahiko* (ancient) practices of maintaining balance between human and divine realms.  \n– The dialogue \"E ke alii ē! He ‘oi kahi keiki ‘u‘uku ikaika loa...\" (O chief! A little boy who was very strong...) serves as a lament or warning, alluding to the destructive consequences of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s actions. The mention of his father’s death and the sacred place (lō‘ihi) may allegorically represent the collapse of traditional structures, as 'Ai Kapu practices were abandoned, with the chief’s authority (mana) tied to the land’s sacredness.  \n– The phrase \"a‘ohe ona ikaika\" (no strength) mirrors the first example’s \"a‘ohe ona ikaika,\" suggesting a thematic link to the loss of power when sacred traditions are disregarded. ‘Ama‘u’s strength and death being inseparable from his place of death (Waikīkī) may allegorically reflect the idea that a chief’s mana (spiritual power) is inseparable from the land they govern, a core concept in Hawaiian cosmology.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
