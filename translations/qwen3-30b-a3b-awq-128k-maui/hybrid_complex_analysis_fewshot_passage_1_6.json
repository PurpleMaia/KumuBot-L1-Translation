  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**  \n• The passage continues the narrative of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish), emphasizing his destructive actions against sweet potato fields, which symbolize the sacred *ai kapu* (sacred restrictions) system. The repetition of \"māla ‘uala\" (sweet potato fields) and \"huhuki ā pau\" (head of the ulua) underscores the symbolic substitution of *ulua* (fish) for human sacrifices in the *ai kapu* era.  \n– \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o\" (eyes of the pāo‘o fish) is analyzed in Example 1 as a metaphor for a child with divine or supernatural qualities, but here his actions challenge the sacredness of the land’s resources.  \n– The phrase \"i luna o kapuahi e ‘ā ana\" (on the top of kapuahi, which is four) likely refers to a place name (kapuahi) tied to the number four, symbolizing the four directions or the four corners of the earth, a common Hawaiian cosmological concept.  \n– \"Pua-li‘i\" (Pua-li‘i) is a name possibly derived from *pua* (flower, blossom) and *li‘i* (to be strong, to grow), suggesting a figure of power or authority, but in this context, he embodies the rigid enforcement of *ai kapu* customs.  \n• The father’s threat to \"make it eat him\" (e make ai ia‘u) allegorically represents the *ai kapu* system’s demand for sacrifice, where *ulua* (fish) replaces human offerings. The \"head and eyes\" (po‘o a me nā maka) of the sweet potato (‘uala) symbolize the vital parts of the crop, which were sacred and required ritual protection.  \n– \"Pōka‘ī\" (Pōka‘ī) is likely a name meaning \"night falls upon the chief,\" reflecting the mother’s role as a guardian of the land’s resources.  \n– The dialogue between Pua-li‘i and Pōka‘ī (\"‘A‘ole\" / \"No\" and \"‘Ae\" / \"Yes\") highlights the tension between preserving sacred traditions (*ai kapu*) and the disruptive forces of a new era.  \n• The numbers \"‘ehā\" (four) and \"e ‘ā ana\" (which is four) may allude to the four sacred directions (*kūkulu ‘au) in Hawaiian cosmology, reinforcing the idea of completeness and the interconnectedness of the land, its people, and the divine. This ties to the *ai kapu* era’s emphasis on structured, ritualistic control over resources.  \n– The destruction of the sweet potato fields by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o symbolizes the collapse of the *ai kapu* system, where the sacred was challenged by the young protagonist’s actions, mirroring historical shifts toward the abolition of *ai kapu* after Kamehameha’s unification of the islands.  \n• The phrase \"e make ai ia‘u\" (to make it eat him) is a metaphor for the father’s attempt to reassert control over the sacred by enforcing the old customs, while Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s actions represent the breaking of these restrictions, aligning with the narrative of progressive thinking in Hawaiian tradition.  \n– \"Kapuahi\" (kapuahi) is likely a place name, possibly linked to the sacred site of *ai kapu* rituals, where the substitution of *ulua* for human sacrifices occurred. This reflects the historical practice of replacing human offerings with fish to avoid bloodshed, rooted in word magic (*kū‘au*) and the sacredness of *ulua* as a symbol of life and abundance.  \n• The allegorical conflict between Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o and Pua-li‘i mirrors the broader struggle between traditionalist and reformist forces in Hawaiian history, particularly during the *ai kapu* era, where rigid social and religious structures were challenged by new ideas.  \n– The name \"Pua-li‘i\" may also allude to the concept of *pō* (night, darkness) and *li‘i* (to grow, to strengthen), suggesting a figure who enforces the old ways through fear and control, contrasting with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s disruptive energy.",

  "reference_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \\[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;"
