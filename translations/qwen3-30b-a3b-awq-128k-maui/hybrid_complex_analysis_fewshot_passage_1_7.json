The children of all ages knew well, moving to the place of the fisherman for the sake of Puali‘i's fishing. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: 'This is the ko‘ilipi in my hand, a thing of strength for my head on this day, and my head, and the pig and the taro, and eat me first, and then peace.' No one could understand the words of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and then Puali‘i spoke new words, of the two. Puali‘i continued to strengthen Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the ko‘ilipi, at that time to pray for Nāmakaokapāo‘o's death by Puali‘i. Thus, the prayer: 'Only my eyes are for the pāo‘o of my land, O you who are gentle, who are kind, O you who are gentle, who are kind, O you who are hungry, who are thirsty, O you who are thirsty, Nākukui‘aimakaokalani.

  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**  \n• This passage continues the narrative of conflict between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, emphasizing ritualistic and symbolic language tied to the *Ai Kapu* era (sacred kapu system). The repetition of phrases like \"e he‘e lā\" (O you who are silent) and \"e hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a mai nei\" (O you who are gentle, who are kind) reflects the structure of traditional Hawaiian prayers and chants, which often use parallelism and invocation to deities or natural forces.  \n– **\"Ko‘ilipi\"** (a sacred object or ritual tool) is central here, symbolizing a conduit for spiritual power. Its placement in Puali‘i’s hand and its association with \"strength for my head\" may allude to the *kānaka* (people) and *kūʻau* (trees) in Hawaiian cosmology, where objects like *ko‘ilipi* were used in ceremonies to channel divine energy.  \n– **\"Nāmakaokapāo‘o\"** (the eyes of the *pāo‘o* fish) retains its earlier symbolic role as a child of extraordinary strength, but here it is contrasted with Puali‘i’s actions, suggesting a struggle between human agency and divine or ritualistic authority. The \"four winds\" (*nā ‘au ‘uala āna ‘ehā*) may represent the four directions of the *mo‘olele* (sacred space), underscoring the sacredness of the act of \"carrying\" the child’s strength.  \n– **The prayer structure** (\"Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o...\") mirrors *mele* (chants) used in *Ai Kapu* rituals, where specific invocations to gods or natural elements were recited to enforce taboos or seek protection. The repetition of \"e he‘e lā\" (O you who are silent) and \"e ‘ai paha, e waiho paha\" (O you who are hungry, who are thirsty) may reflect the dualities of *mana* (spiritual power) and *kūʻike* (sacred duty), with the *pāo‘o* (fish) and *kālua* (pig) as sacred offerings.  \n– **\"Kukui‘aimakaokalani\"** and **\"Nākukui‘aimakaokalani\"** are likely variations of a place name or deity, with *kukui* (shadow, darkness) and *aimaka* (to make calm) suggesting a connection to the god *Kukui* (associated with rain and darkness) and *Makau* (the *makua* of the land). The phrase \"Only death for Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" may allegorically represent the collapse of *Ai Kapu* traditions, where Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s strength defies the era’s rigid structures.  \n• The mention of \"pule make\" (prayer for death) by Puali‘i highlights the tension between human will and divine law. In the *Ai Kapu* era, such prayers could be acts of defiance or attempts to enforce kapu through supernatural means. Puali‘i’s actions here may symbolize the resistance to change, while Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s destructive behavior (from earlier chapters) represents the forward march of progress, undermining *Ai Kapu* practices.  \n– The symbolic exchange of \"head\" (*po‘o*) and \"eyes\" (*maka*) in the prayer, replacing *ulua* (fish) as a substitute for human sacrifice, reinforces the allegorical critique of *Ai Kapu* customs. By threatening to \"eat\" Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s \"head\" and \"eyes,\" Puali‘i may be invoking the same wordplay used in *Ai Kapu* to replace human offerings with animals or plants, reflecting the era’s esoteric rituals.  \n– The final lines (\"Only people and the fish. Only the fish and the pig. Only death...\") may allude to the *mo‘olele* (sacred space) and the *kū‘ike* (sacred duty) of maintaining balance. The exclusion of other elements (e.g., the pig and taro) could symbolize the erasure of traditional practices, while \"death\" represents the consequences of violating kapu.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
