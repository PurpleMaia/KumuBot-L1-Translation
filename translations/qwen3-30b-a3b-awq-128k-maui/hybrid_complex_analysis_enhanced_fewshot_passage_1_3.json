  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**  \n• This passage introduces **Pua-li'i (Puali'i)**, a \"good man\" (kanaka maika'i) from **Līhu'e (Wāhiāwā)**, and **Pōka'ī**, a woman described as having a child and a \"ruined\" body (ua 'ino'ino ko'u kino). The narrative follows the conventions of Hawaiian storytelling, where characters are introduced with their origins, relationships, and cultural contexts;  \n– **Pua-li'i** (likely \"Pua\" as a prefix denoting a child or descendant, and \"li'i\" as a name) is positioned as a suitor, arriving from inland (iho maila) to **Honouliuli (dark bay)** in **'Ewa**. His visit to **Pōka'ī's** home reflects the **'Ai Kapu era** practice of hospitality, where strangers were welcomed and offered food, a custom rooted in the reverence for **mana** (spiritual power) and communal responsibility;  \n– **Pōka'ī** (possibly \"Pō\" [night] + \"ka'ī\" [a name]) is portrayed as a woman with a child, suggesting she may be a widow or a mother in a society where **kūpuna** (elders) or **mo'okū'auhau** (genealogical lineage) were central to social structure. Her hesitation (\"Pehea ‘oe e makemake ai ia‘u?\") stems from the belief that a woman with a child and \"ruined\" body (ua 'ino'ino) might be spiritually or socially constrained, a concept tied to **'Ai Kapu** restrictions on certain activities or relationships;  \n• The dialogue between Pua-li'i and Pōka'ī highlights the tension between **traditional values** and **individual agency**. Pua-li'i's insistence (\"He mea ‘ole ia mau mea, ke makemake ‘oe ia‘u, e moe kāua\") reflects a shift toward **moe kāua** (cohabitation), which in the **'Ai Kapu era** could symbolize a challenge to rigid taboos, as **'Ai Kapu** (sacred eating) emphasized communal rituals and restrictions. However, here the phrase \"e moe kāua\" (let's sleep together) may allude to **mahi** (work) and **ho'okipa** (hospitality) as foundational to relationships, even in the face of cultural norms;  \n• The relocation to **Keahumoa (heap of chickens)** in **Līhu'e** underscores the symbolic importance of **'āina** (land) and **kuleana** (responsibility). Keahumoa, a place name, may reference the **māla (garden)** practices of the **'Ai Kapu era**, where land was cultivated collectively. Pōka'ī's decision to move with Pua-li'i signifies a **kū'ula (honor)** in accepting a partner despite societal stigma, aligning with the **mālama 'āina** (caring for the land) ethos;  \n• The phrase **\"ua 'ino'ino ko'u kino\"** (\"my body is ruined\") may allude to **kūpā (sacredness)** and **kū'ike (transgression)**, suggesting Pōka'ī's self-perception as spiritually or socially compromised. Pua-li'i's dismissal of this (\"He mea ‘ole ia mau mea\") reflects a **mālama 'āina** approach, prioritizing **lā'au (healing)** and **ho'okipa** over rigid taboos, a theme seen in stories where **kāne (men)** and **wahine (women)** transcend **'Ai Kapu** restrictions to form new kinship bonds;  \n• The structure of the paragraph mirrors **Hawaiian oral traditions** where **kāne** and **wahine** are introduced through their actions and relationships, emphasizing **ho'okipa** (hospitality) and **kōkua** (helping) as central to cultural identity. Pua-li'i's proposal and Pōka'ī's acceptance also highlight the **mālama pū (care for the people)** principle, where individuals are valued beyond their physical state.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
