  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "And the village of Ama'u, the chief who was a leader, and he went down to the lower part of Ewa with the people of Namakaokapāo'o. And the people of Ama'u with his people in Ewa, they went to the place where Namakaokapāo'o is eternal, no one is like you, and the chief was. This is the O'ahu of Namakaokapāo'o, and then, they looked upon his mother and the chief was placed on the land of O'ahu.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>And the village of Ama'u, the chief who was a leader, and he went down to the lower part of Ewa with the people of Namakaokapāo'o. And the people of Ama'u with his people in Ewa, they went to the place where Namakaokapāo'o is eternal, no one is like you, and the chief was. This is the O'ahu of Namakaokapāo'o, and then, they looked upon his mother and the chief was placed on the land of O'ahu.</translation>  \n\n<commentary>This passage is part of a larger narrative section that likely recounts a historical or mythological story involving conflicts, migrations, or territorial claims between groups or individuals in ancient Hawaii. The names \"Ama'u\" and \"Namakaokapāo'o\" may reference specific ancestors or places, while terms like \"wa'a kaua\" (canoe of the people) and \"luku ā pau loa\" (eternal land) reflect cultural concepts of lineage, geography, and sacredness. The structure suggests a genealogical or legendary account, common in Hawaiian oral traditions, emphasizing leadership, kinship, and divine connections.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
