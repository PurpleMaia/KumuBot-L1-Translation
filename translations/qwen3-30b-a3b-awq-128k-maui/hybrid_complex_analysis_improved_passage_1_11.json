  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "Then, he read to the daughter of Kona, hidden in the cave of Waipouli. Then the daughter returned to their house in Keahumoa, residing in peace. He placed Nāmakaokapāo'o on the roof of the house, he placed the sacredness of the kua and alo, and dwelled in peace in the middle of the sacred roof of the house.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>Then, he read to the daughter of Kona, hidden in the cave of Waipouli. Then the daughter returned to their house in Keahumoa, residing in peace. He placed Nāmakaokapāo'o on the roof of the house, he placed the sacredness of the kua and alo, and dwelled in peace in the middle of the sacred roof of the house.</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• The passage reflects the tension between traditional Hawaiian spiritual practices and the societal upheaval following the abolition of the *ʻAi Kapu* (taboo system) in 1819.  \n  – The \"cave of Waipouli\" symbolizes a sacred, hidden space for ritual or refuge, aligning with pre-contact *moʻolelo* (myths) where caves were portals to the *moʻohai* (spirit world) or sites of *kapu* (sacred law).  \n  – The daughter’s return to \"Keahumoa\" (a place name possibly linked to the north) and her residence in peace contrasts with the chaos of the post-1819 era, suggesting a struggle to preserve cultural identity.  \n\n• The name *Nāmakaokapāoʻo* carries layered symbolism: *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo* (the open eye of the observer).  \n  – *Maka* (eye) and *pāoʻo* (observer/keeper of sacred knowledge) evoke the concept of *ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi* (Hawaiian language) as a vessel for spiritual insight.  \n  – The name may allegorically represent the *kupuna* (elders) or *kahu* (guardians) who safeguarded sacred traditions during cultural transitions.  \n\n• The act of placing *kua* (sacred object) and *alo* (sacred space) on the roof mirrors the collapse of the *ʻAi Kapu* system and the erosion of traditional *moolelo* (history) under missionary influence.  \n  – *Kua* and *alo* were central to *kapu* rituals, but their placement \"on the roof\" (symbolizing elevation or separation from the earth) may critique the loss of communal sacred spaces post-1820.  \n  – The repetition of \"moe ihola\" (dwelled in peace) underscores the fragility of harmony in a society grappling with foreign ideologies.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
