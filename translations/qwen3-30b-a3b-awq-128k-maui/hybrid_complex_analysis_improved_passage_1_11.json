  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_translation": "At night, they read to the woman in Kona, concealed in the grove of Waipouli. Then the woman returned to their house in Keahumoa, residing in peace. They placed Nāmakaokapāo'o over the mouth of the house, removing the covering of the mouth and the door, and rested in peace in the midst of the mouth of the house.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>At night, they read to the woman in Kona, concealed in the grove of Waipouli. Then the woman returned to their house in Keahumoa, residing in peace. They placed Nāmakaokapāo'o over the mouth of the house, removing the covering of the mouth and the door, and rested in peace in the midst of the mouth of the house.</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• The narrative symbolizes the transition from sacred restriction to communal restoration under the 'Ai Kapu system.  \n  – The \"grove of Waipouli\" (ke ana o Waipouli) reflects a traditional ritual space, aligning with 'Ai Kapu-era practices where groves were sites for spiritual observances.  \n  – The act of concealing the woman (makuahine) in the grove parallels the ritual seclusion of ali’i (noblewomen) during sacred periods, emphasizing social hierarchy and spiritual boundaries.  \n\n• The name \"Nāmakaokapāo’o\" (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo’o) carries layered symbolism.  \n  – \"Maka\" (eye) and \"pāo’o\" (a type of fish or a term for \"the place where the fish is caught\") suggest a guardian of knowledge or a metaphor for the \"eye of the sea,\" linking to navigational wisdom.  \n  – The placement of \"Nāmakaokapāo’o\" over the \"mouth of the house\" (kaupoku o ka hale) may allegorically represent the restoration of access to sacred knowledge, with the \"mouth\" symbolizing entry or communication.  \n\n• The text reflects post-1820 missionary influence and cultural shifts.  \n  – The \"abandonment of kapu\" in 1819 is hinted through the removal of the \"covering\" (mou’u), symbolizing the end of restrictive taboos.  \n  – \"Keahumoa\" (peaceful dwelling) may allude to the 19th-century Christianization of Hawaiian society, where \"ihola\" (peace) became a central ideal.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
