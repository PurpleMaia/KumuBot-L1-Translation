'Ama'u, with his people in Ewa, aimed to destroy Nāmakaokapāo'o throughout the entire land, for no one is like you, and 'Ama'u became a warrior on the land of O'ahu.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>It is known that 'Ama'u, a fierce warrior, led his war canoes to confront Nāmakaokapāo'o, and went down to Ewa to fight against Nāmakaokapāo'o. 'Ama'u, with his people in Ewa, aimed to destroy Nāmakaokapāo'o throughout the entire land, for no one is like you, and 'Ama'u became a warrior on the land of O'ahu.</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n**Paragraph 14:**  \n• The passage introduces **'Ama'u (m)**, a warrior leader, and his conflict with **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (m)** (the eyes of the pāo'o fish), emphasizing their roles in a battle over land and resources. 'Ama'u’s actions—leading war canoes (*wa'a kaua*) and targeting Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o—reflect tensions between traditional power structures and emerging challenges.  \n– **'Ama'u** is likely a name or title, possibly derived from *ama* (to strike, to attack) and *u* (a suffix indicating a place or person), suggesting a \"warrior of attack\" or \"aggressor.\"  \n– The phrase *e noke mai ana 'o Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o* (\"to destroy Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o\") uses *noke* (to destroy) and *maka* (eyes), symbolizing the erasure of a cultural or spiritual legacy tied to the *pāo'o* fish, which in Hawaiian tradition often represents protection or sacredness. This mirrors the example’s allegory of challenging *Ai Kapu* (sacred laws) by disrupting symbolic resources.  \n• **Ewa** (a district on O'ahu) and **O'ahu nei** (this O'ahu) are specified as the locations, grounding the narrative in a specific geographic and political context. The reference to *kula* (to fight, to battle) underscores the militaristic stakes.  \n– **'Ama'u’s** threat to \"destroy the whole land\" (*luku ā pau loa*) may allegorically represent the collapse of traditional systems (*Ai Kapu*) through overexploitation or defiance, while *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o* symbolizes the sacredness of the land’s resources.  \n• The line *a make ihola 'o 'Ama'u* (\"and 'Ama'u became a warrior\") highlights the transformation of 'Ama'u into a warrior figure, possibly reflecting the rise of a new power structure or the rejection of old hierarchies.  \n– The phrase *ki'i akula ia i kona makuahine* (\"a symbol of his mother\") links 'Ama'u to his mother, suggesting a connection to ancestral or spiritual lineage. This may allude to the *makuahine* (mother) as a symbol of the land’s fertility or the *moʻolelo* (history) of O'ahu.  \n• The narrative context ties to the **'Ai Kapu era** (sacred laws), where certain lands and resources were protected. 'Ama'u’s actions could symbolize the disruption of these laws, while Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s legacy represents the traditional guardianship of the land.  \n– The conflict between 'Ama'u and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may allegorically reflect the tension between *kupuna* (elders) and *maoli* (new generations) during the transition from *Ai Kapu* to Western-influenced practices.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
