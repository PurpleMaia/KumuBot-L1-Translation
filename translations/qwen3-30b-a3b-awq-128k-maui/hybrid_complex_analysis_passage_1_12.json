They asked: \"Why are you here?\" Namakaokapāo'o replied: \"It is you who are here.\" He poured water on the head of the house, on the head of the house, and the Namakaokapāo'o.

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nThe chief Ama'u from Waikīkī was a warrior, and there was a great gathering of people in the single house. Thus ended the warriors. They went to the field of Keahumoa, entering the house, no one. They waited, asking Namakaokapāo'o on the hill. They spoke in the voice, no one's knowledge of the body. They asked: \"Why are you here?\" Namakaokapāo'o replied: \"It is you who are here.\" He poured water on the head of the house, on the head of the house, and the Namakaokapāo'o. Namakaokapāo'o replied: \"What is this that you are doing?\" They answered: \"We are coming to fight with Namakaokapāo'o, a place for children to be like you, strong and brave, he who is in the care of his father, the chief, Puli'i.\"  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• [Narrative context and historical transition]  \n  – This passage reflects the collapse of traditional Hawaiian societal structures during the post-1820 missionary era, as 'Ai Kapu (sacred dietary laws) and kapu (taboos) were abolished in 1819, leading to societal upheaval. The \"single house\" (kānaka ka nui) may symbolize the fragmentation of communal living under colonial influence.  \n  – The mention of \"field of Keahumoa\" (kula o Keahumoa) could reference a specific geographic or symbolic battleground, aligning with historical conflicts between rival chiefs or the erosion of traditional mo'olelo (stories) as Western narratives took precedence.  \n\n• [Allegorical symbolism of names and terms]  \n  – **Ama'u**: \"Ama-u\" (to be still/quiet) + \"u\" (suffix indicating location), suggesting a figure of restraint or silence, possibly representing the suppression of indigenous knowledge.  \n  – **Keahumoa**: \"Kea\" (white) + \"humoa\" (to be silent/quiet), symbolizing a place of stillness or isolation, reflecting the loss of traditional spaces for conflict resolution.  \n  – **Namakaokapāo'o**: \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o\" (the sea of the pāo'o fish), where \"pāo'o\" (a type of fish) may allegorically signify a guardian or protector, while \"namaka\" (sea) could represent the vastness of knowledge or the people.  \n\n• [Cultural practices and social critique]  \n  – The \"kānaka ka nui\" (great gathering of people) contrasts with the \"kula o Keahumoa\" (field of Keahumoa), highlighting the tension between communal life and individualized conflict post-contact. The absence of \"kanaka\" (people) in the house (\"a'ohe kanaka\") mirrors the displacement of traditional governance structures.  \n  – The dialogue \"Why are you here?\" and \"It is you who are here\" may critique the accountability of leaders during societal transformation, echoing the breakdown of ali'i (chief) authority after the 1819 abolition of 'Ai Kapu.  \n  – The phrase \"wahi keiki 'u'uku\" (place for children to be like you) alludes to the erosion of traditional education systems, as missionaries later replaced indigenous knowledge with Western methods.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
