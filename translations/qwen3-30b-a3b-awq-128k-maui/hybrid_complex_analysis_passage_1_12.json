  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nIt was a time of peace for Ama'u, the chief from Waikīkī, there were warriors, in the group of one, there was a great warrior, such as all the warriors. They went to the school of Keahumoa, they entered inside the house, no one. No one had knowledge of the body, they said: \"What are you doing here?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o answered: \"It is you who is here.\" They brought the people, there were at the door of the house, there were at the entrance of the house, looking for Nāmakaokapāo'o.

The mention of \"Keahumoa\" (possibly a name of a place or person) and \"Puali'i\" (a name often associated with Hawaiian mythology or historical figures) suggests a connection to a broader mythological or historical context. The dialogue and references to warriors, a chief, and a same-sex relationship (via \"kona makua kāne,\" meaning \"his husband\") reflect themes common in Hawaiian oral traditions, such as honor, duty, and familial or romantic bonds. The structure of the text, with its mix of narrative and direct speech, aligns with the storytelling conventions of ancient Hawaiian literature, which often emphasized genealogy, conflict, and spiritual or social hierarchies.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
