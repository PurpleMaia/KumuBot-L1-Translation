They went to Keahumoa's school, entered the house, no people. They arrived late, they asked Nāmakaokapāo'o on top of the house. They listened in the voice, no one had knowledge of the body, they asked them: 'How are you doing this?' Nāmakaokapāo'o replied: 'Only you here.' They went to the door of the house, there were people who were quick, there were people at the front of the house, and Nāmakaokapāo'o was there. Nāmakaokapāo'o asked: 'What is this that you are doing?' They replied: 'We are coming here to be with Nāmakaokapāo'o, for the place of children, for strength and courage, he who is with his father, Puali'i.'\"",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The text reflects elements of Hawaiian oral tradition, including dialogue, place names (e.g., Keahumoa, Waikīkī), and references to social structures (e.g., \"kula\" as a school or gathering place, \"kumu\" as a teacher). The mention of \"Puali'i\" (possibly a name or title) and the emphasis on \"ke koa loa\" (great warriors) suggest themes of leadership, community, and cultural values. The structure combines descriptive elements with direct speech, characteristic of Hawaiian storytelling, and highlights the interplay between human figures and their environment, such as the house (\"hale\") and its symbolic significance.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
