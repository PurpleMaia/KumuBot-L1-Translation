The *lani* (chief) here may allude to the sacredness of leadership in Hawaiian society;  \n– **Nāmakaokai‘a** (Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a): *I‘a* (fish) is a central element in Hawaiian cosmology, often symbolizing abundance and spiritual connection. The name may also reference the *‘Ai Kapu* practice of using fish as offerings, contrasting with the earlier era’s human sacrifices;  \n• The phrase **“he makua kāne ‘o Nāmakaokalani a he keiki ‘o Nāmakaokai‘a”** (Nāmakaokalani is the father and Nāmakaokai‘a is the child) reflects a common narrative structure in Hawaiian lore, where familial roles and relationships are tied to mythic or historical contexts;  \n– The use of *makua kāne* (father) and *keiki* (child) emphasizes generational hierarchy, a key aspect of *ʻapanaʻi* (ancestral lineage) in Hawaiian tradition;  \n• The final clause **“akā, ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o”** (therefore, they were incorporated into the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o) suggests ritualistic or mythic integration, where individuals are spiritually enmeshed in sacred practices;  \n– *Komo* (to be incorporated) here may reference the act of *komo* (to lie down, to rest) in a spiritual sense, as seen in *heiau* (temples) where offerings were placed. *Pule* (prayer) in this context could allude to the *‘Ai Kapu* era’s emphasis on sacred speech and ritual invocations;  \n– The name **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o** (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish) from earlier examples is likely connected, as this passage may foreshadow the conflict between *Nāmakaokalani* (father) and *Nāmakaokai‘a* (child) with *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (the main protagonist), symbolizing the tension between tradition and transformation;  \n• Allegorically, the inclusion of these names in a prayer may represent the cyclical nature of Hawaiian cosmology, where ancestral figures are perpetually linked to the land and its resources. The *‘Ai Kapu* system, which governed sacred practices, often required such symbolic associations to maintain balance between humans and the divine;  \n– The repetition of *nā maka* (eyes) in multiple names may allude to the concept of *maka* (to see) as a metaphor for wisdom or spiritual insight, contrasting with the destructive behavior of *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* in earlier paragraphs, who tore apart sweet potato patches;  \n– The phrase *“kāne”* (man) and *“wahine”* (woman) in the names may reflect the gendered roles in *‘Ai Kapu*—*kāne* as warriors and *wahine* as those under sacred protection, though this passage focuses on *kāne* (father) and *keiki* (child), suggesting a lineage tied to both spiritual and earthly authority.",

  "reference_translation": "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity."
