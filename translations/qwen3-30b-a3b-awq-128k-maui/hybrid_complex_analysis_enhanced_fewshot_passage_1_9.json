At that time, Puali'i was seeking the prayer from Nāmakaokapāo'o's head, to reverse the eyes of the ko'i of Puali'i, the head, and speak from another place. The head of Puali'i came to Nāmakaokapāo'o: \"Hello to you, O Nāmakaokapāo'o.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o took the head of Puali'i and cast it into the sea of Waipouli, he was at the edge of Honouliuli, his loa, five miles the loa.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 9:**  \n• The text describes a pivotal moment where Nāmakaokapāo'o completes a ritual or prayer, symbolizing the culmination of a spiritual or cultural act. The phrase \"ko‘ilipi i luna pono o Nāmakaokapāo'o\" (the \"ko‘ilipi\" on the pono of Nāmakaokapāo'o) may allude to a sacred object or concept tied to his identity, possibly a metaphor for his spiritual authority or the \"head\" of his lineage.  \n• Puali'i’s attempt to \"obtain the prayer\" and \"reverse the eyes of the ko'i\" (perhaps a symbolic reference to disrupting a sacred vision or power) reflects tensions between traditional practices and transformative actions. The \"head\" (po‘o) and \"eyes\" (‘oi) here may carry dual meanings: literal body parts and metaphors for leadership or insight, aligning with Hawaiian cosmology where the head is sacred (pō‘o) and eyes (‘oi) signify perception or divine knowledge.  \n• The dialogue \"Aloha ‘oe\" (Hello to you) is a respectful greeting, emphasizing relational dynamics. The act of Nāmakaokapāo'o taking Puali'i’s head and casting it into the sea of Waipouli (a place name) may symbolize the severing of a spiritual or familial bond, a common motif in Hawaiian narratives where water represents transition or purification.  \n• The phrase \"he ana ma kahakai o Honouliuli, ‘o kona loa, ‘elima mile ka loa\" (he was at the edge of Honouliuli, his loa, five miles the loa) likely references specific geographic or ritual locations. \"Loa\" (a name or term for a deity or spirit) and \"five miles\" could signify a symbolic boundary or a metaphor for distance from sacred practices, suggesting a shift away from 'Ai Kapu (sacred) traditions.  \n• The narrative mirrors themes from earlier examples, such as the conflict between \"Ai Kapu\" rituals (sacred laws) and progressive change. Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions—destroying sweet potato patches (Example 3) and now casting a head into the sea—reflect a defiance of traditional hierarchies, possibly allegorizing the abandonment of ritualistic violence or the rejection of kapu restrictions.  \n• The name \"Puali'i\" (possibly derived from *pua* [flower] + *li‘i* [to twist or bind]) may symbolize a figure tied to earthly or spiritual entanglements, while \"Nāmakaokapāo'o\" (eyes of the pāo'o fish) underscores his connection to water and vision, aligning with the sea imagery.  \n• The act of casting the head into the sea could parallel the \"kiola\" (to throw) ritual, where offerings are made to deities or to cleanse a space, reflecting a cultural practice of returning objects to their origin or purifying through water.",

  "reference_translation": "When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength."
