The dialogue between Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī mirrors tensions between indigenous traditions and foreign ideologies.  \n  – Pōka‘ī’s mention of “children” and “son” (kūna) symbolizes the traditional family structure, which was disrupted by missionary-driven reforms that redefined gender roles and kinship.  \n\n• Symbolism of names and locations:  \n  – **Pōka‘ī**: “Pō” (night) + “ka‘ī” (edge, boundary). Represents the twilight of traditional practices, as “night” often symbolizes endings or the unknown in Hawaiian cosmology.  \n  – **Puali‘i**: “Pau” (end, completion) + “li‘i” (to be in a place). Suggests a transition or conclusion, possibly reflecting the end of an era or the “completion” of cultural change.  \n  – **Keahumoa**: “Kea” (crow, metaphor for a leader) + “humoa” (to grow, cultivate). May symbolize the introduction of Western agricultural methods (e.g., missionary gardens) or the “growth” of Christianity, displacing indigenous practices.  \n\n• Historical and cultural context of 1819–1820:  \n  – The abolition of 'Ai Kapu in 1819 dismantled the rigid social and religious structures of pre-contact Hawaii, leading to the erosion of sacred taboos. Pōka‘ī’s reference to his “son” could allude to the loss of genealogical continuity under foreign influence.  \n  – The phrase “e moe kāua” (let us sleep) may metaphorically signify the end of traditional practices, as sleep in Hawaiian lore often represents death or the passage of time. This aligns with the post-1820 period, where missionary activity and Westernization suppressed indigenous rituals.  \n\n• Allegorical critique of cultural erasure:  \n  – Puali‘i’s question about a “woman” (wahine) could symbolize the loss of female autonomy in a patriarchal colonial system. The term “wahine” (woman) in this context might critique the gendered impacts of missionary policies that marginalized women’s roles.  \n  – The garden of Keahumoa (Keahumoa) may represent the displacement of traditional ahupua‘a (land divisions) by foreign land ownership systems, reflecting the broader theme of resource control and cultural assimilation.  \n\n• Post-contact biases and hybridity:  \n  – The text’s structure and dialogue hint at a hybrid narrative influenced by missionary scribes, who often reinterpreted oral traditions through a Christian lens. The phrase “He mea ‘ole ia mau mea” (“These things are nothing”) may reflect colonial narratives dismissing indigenous knowledge as “nothing” in favor of Western frameworks.  \n  – The mention of “husband” (kāne) alongside Puali‘i’s name could indicate a blending of traditional Hawaiian gender roles (e.g., kumu (teacher) and kāne (male)) with foreign concepts of marriage, suggesting a cultural collision.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
