Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and asked him, spoke to him: “Ask you about a wife now.” Pōka‘ī replied: “How do you ask me about a wife? I have children, and my husband is dead.” Puali‘i replied: “These things are nothing, you ask me, let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed. Then Pōka‘ī with his husband and Puali‘i to the house of Keahumoa, reside.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "• The dialogue between Puali‘i and Pōka‘i allegorically represents the tension between traditional Hawaiian values and the transformative pressures of colonialism and missionary influence.  \n  – Pōka‘i’s assertion of having children and a deceased husband reflects the disruption of the *‘Ai Kapu* (sacred dietary laws) and social structures during the 1819 abolition of the kapu system, which dismantled rigid gender roles and familial hierarchies.  \n  – Puali‘i’s dismissal of Pōka‘i’s status as “nothing” symbolizes the erosion of old traditions, while his suggestion of “sleeping together” (e moe kāua) metaphorically signifies the imposition of new, foreign norms, such as monogamy and Christian marriage practices.  \n\n• Symbolism of names and terms:  \n  – *Puali‘i* (Pua-li‘i): “Pua” (flower) and “li‘i” (to be small, humble). The name may symbolize a person who is modest yet vital, reflecting the fragility of traditional Hawaiian identity under external pressures.  \n  – *Pōka‘ī* (Pō-ka‘ī): “Pō” (night) and “ka‘ī” (to be strong, firm). Suggests resilience or steadfastness, possibly representing the last vestiges of pre-contact social order.  \n  – *Keahumoa* (Kea-humoa): “Kea” (a type of bird, often associated with royalty) and “humoa” (to be strong, firm). The term may symbolize a new, fortified social structure emerging post-1820, influenced by missionary reforms.  \n\n• Historical and cultural context:  \n  – The *‘Ai Kapu* era (pre-1819) emphasized strict social codes, including restrictions on marriage and food. Pōka‘i’s reference to his husband’s death and children may allude to the collapse of these systems, as kapu were abolished by Kamehameha II in 1819, allowing for the mixing of men and women and the reorganization of family life.  \n  – Post-1820 missionary influence introduced Christian morality, which likely shaped the narrative’s critique of polygamy and the redefinition of relationships. The phrase “e moe kāua” (let’s sleep together) could reflect the missionaries’ emphasis on “chastity” and “family” as replacements for traditional *kānaka‘o* (sacred unions) or *kumu‘o* (marriage alliances).  \n  – The term *kāne* (husband) and *wahine* (wife) in the dialogue may highlight the shift from *kānaka‘o* (sacred partnerships) to more rigid, Western-influenced marital roles, as documented in studies of Hawaiian social transformation (e.g., Kuykendall, 1953).  \n\n• Numerical symbolism and riddles:  \n  – The absence of explicit numbers in the text may symbolize the void left by the collapse of the kapu system, where traditional structures were replaced by ambiguity.  \n  – The repetition of “kāne” (husband) and “wahine” (wife) could reflect the binary oppositions in Hawaiian cosmology, such as *maunakea* (mountain) and *moana* (ocean), but here it underscores the destabilization of gender roles.  \n\n• Social commentary:  \n  – The narrative critiques the loss of autonomy in Hawaiian social systems, as Pōka‘i’s agency is undermined by Puali‘i’s proposition, mirroring the erosion of *mo‘olelo* (history/tradition) under colonialism.  \n  – Puali‘i’s dismissal of Pōka‘i’s past (“he mea ‘ole ia mau mea”) may reflect the missionaries’ view of traditional practices as “heathen” or “useless,” as seen in early 19th-century missionary journals (e.g., Bingham, 1823).  \n  – The union of Pōka‘i with Puali‘i and his husband in the “house of Keahumoa” could symbolize the forced integration of Hawaiian society into a new, foreign framework, where *ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi* (Hawaiian language) and *kuleana* (rights) were marginalized.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
