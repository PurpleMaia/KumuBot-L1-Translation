  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "• [Allegorical interpretation of birth and transition]  \n  – The passage symbolizes the cultural and spiritual rebirth of a new era in Hawaiian society, reflecting the shift from the 'Ai Kapu (sacred law) system to the post-contact reforms. The \"birth\" of Nāmakaokapāo‘o represents the emergence of a new generation shaped by colonial influences and internal conflict.  \n  – The phrase \"ma laila lāua i launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho\" (they were caught in a fight and slept, and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o) may allegorically depict the turmoil of the 1819–1820s, when the abolition of 'Ai Kapu and missionary arrival disrupted traditional structures. The \"sleep\" could signify a period of dormancy or resistance before the \"birth\" of a transformed cultural identity.  \n\n• [Symbolism of names and their etymology]  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o\" (plural eyes-of-the-pāo‘o). \"Maka\" (eyes) and \"pāo‘o\" (a type of fish or a name) may symbolize vision or guidance, possibly linked to the goddess Nāmaka (sea deity), suggesting a connection to oceanic resources or spiritual insight.  \n  – **Pōka‘ī**: \"Pō-ka‘ī\" (night-alone). Reflects the \"night\" of the old kapu system, with \"ka‘ī\" (solitude) implying isolation or the end of a traditional order.  \n  – **Kauluakaha‘i**: \"Kau-luakaha-i\" (plant-path-i). \"Kau\" (to plant) and \"luakaha\" (to clear a path) may signify the act of re-establishing or \"planting\" new social norms, allegorically representing the post-1820 missionary influence and the reconfiguration of Hawaiian society.  \n\n• [Historical and cultural context]  \n  – The reference to \"kino ai\" (people and) and \"moe ‘ana iho\" (sleeping) aligns with the 1819 abolition of 'Ai Kapu, where the collapse of the old system led to a \"sleep\" of traditional practices, followed by the \"birth\" of a new social order.  \n  – \"Noho ihola ‘o Pōka‘ī me kona hāpai\" (while Pōka‘ī with his wife) may allude to the erosion of gender roles under missionary influence, where \"hāpai\" (to take) could imply the transfer of power or cultural authority.  \n  – The term \"‘ilihune\" (a type of fish) ties to the sacredness of marine resources in Hawaiian cosmology, but its mention here might critique the shift from traditional resource management to Western practices, as seen in post-contact reforms.  \n\n• [Post-contact social commentary]  \n  – The narrative reflects tensions between traditional values and missionary-driven changes, such as the 1820s abolition of kapu and the introduction of Christianity. The \"birth\" of Nāmakaokapāo‘o symbolizes the hybridization of Hawaiian culture, blending indigenous and foreign elements.  \n  – The name \"Kauluakaha‘i\" (planting a path) could critique the imposition of Western agriculture and land ownership, which disrupted the ahupua‘a system. This aligns with the \"return to his land\" motif, highlighting the loss of traditional sovereignty.  \n  – Numerical symbolism: The repetition of \"ma\" (in) and \"iho\" (down) may allude to the three stages of Hawaiian history: pre-contact (Pōka‘ī), post-1819 transition (Kauluakaha‘i), and post-missionary rebirth (Nāmakaokapāo‘o).  \n\n• [Cultural symbolism of 'āina and 'ai kapu]  \n  – \"‘Āina\" (land) is central to Hawaiian identity, representing life and ancestral connection. The return of Kauluakaha‘i to his \"‘āina\" could symbolize the struggle to preserve land and sovereignty amid colonial pressures.  \n  – The \"birth\" of Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the context of \"‘ilihune loa\" (great ‘ilihune) may reference the sacredness of fish in traditional Hawaiian diets, but also the disruption of these practices by Western influence.  \n  – Scholars like Kuykendall (1958) note that 'Ai Kapu governed food and social hierarchies, and this passage might mirror the collapse of such systems, with \"kino ai\" (people and) as a metaphor for the merging of old and new social structures.",

  "reference_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
