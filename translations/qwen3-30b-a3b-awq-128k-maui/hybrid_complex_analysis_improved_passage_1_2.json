Then Pōka‘ī was born to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, then Kauluakaha‘i was born in that land, because Pōka‘ī and his wife, and afterwards, was born. In this birth, there was a great child of Pōka‘ī and his child of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "• **Allegorical interpretation of the land and lineage**  \n  – The phrase “O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina” (Hō‘ae‘ae of Ewa is the land) suggests a symbolic connection to the district of Ewa (a region on O‘ahu) as a place of origin or spiritual foundation. “Hō‘ae‘ae” (eternal, unending) may represent the cyclical nature of Hawaiian cosmology, where land and lineage are tied to the divine.  \n  – The naming of “Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (Sea’s Fullness or Moon’s Abundance) could allegorically signify the union of celestial forces (sea and moon) as creators of life, reflecting the Hawaiian belief in the sacredness of natural elements as ancestors.  \n\n• **Symbolism of names and their etymology**  \n  – **Pōka‘ī**: “Pō” (night, realm of the dead) + “ka‘ī” (to be born, to emerge). Allegorically, this may represent the birth of a new era from the “night” of the old kapu system, symbolizing transition or renewal.  \n  – **Kauluakaha‘i**: “Kau” (to be strong, endure) + “lu” (to be, to exist) + “kaha‘i” (to be born). This could symbolize resilience or the enduring strength of the people, reflecting post-contact struggles to maintain cultural identity.  \n  – **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**: “Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o” (the sea’s fullness, the moon’s abundance). “Nāmaka” (sea) and “pāo‘o” (abundance, completion) may allude to the ocean as a source of life and the moon as a symbol of time and fertility, linking the narrative to traditional cosmology.  \n\n• **Historical and cultural context: Transition from ‘Ai Kapu to Missionary Influence**  \n  – The passage may allude to the collapse of the ‘Ai Kapu (sacred laws) in 1819, when Kamehameha II abolished the kapu system, marking a shift from ritualistic to secular governance. The “night” (Pō) and “moon” (‘ula) could symbolize the old religious order, while the “sea” (Nāmaka) represents the people’s connection to the ocean.  \n  – The mention of “hānau” (birth) and lineage might critique the erosion of traditional genealogical ties during the missionary period (post-1820), as foreign influences disrupted indigenous knowledge systems.  \n  – “Kauluakaha‘i” (Born of Strength) could reflect the struggle to preserve cultural identity amid colonialism, with “kau” (endure) symbolizing the resilience of Hawaiian values.  \n\n• **Numerical symbolism and riddles**  \n  – The repetition of “kāna keiki” (his child) and the structure of the names may hint at genealogical continuity, emphasizing the importance of lineage in Hawaiian society.  \n  – The phrase “ma kēia hānau ‘ana” (in this birth) could imply a metaphorical rebirth of the people, aligning with the 1819 abolition of ‘Ai Kapu as a symbolic “death” of the old order and “birth” of a new one.  \n\n• **Social commentary and critique**  \n  – The narrative may critique the disruption of traditional social structures by colonial forces, as the “sea and moon” (Nāmakaokapāo‘o) as ancestors contrast with the post-contact era’s secularization.  \n  – The name “Pōka‘ī” (Born of the Night) could symbolize the lingering influence of old religious practices, while “Kauluakaha‘i” (Born of Strength) reflects the need for adaptation.  \n  – The ambiguity of “ho‘i akula” (then again) might signify the cyclical nature of Hawaiian history, where past and future intertwine, but also the tension between tradition and change.",

  "reference_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",

When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
