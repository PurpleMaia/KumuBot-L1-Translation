Represents celestial guidance and the role of ali‘i (chiefs) as intermediaries between gods and people  \n  – *Nāmakaokai‘a* (Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a): \"Eyes of the Fish\" (i‘a = fish). Symbolizes the ocean’s bounty and the ali‘i’s responsibility to manage *lo‘i‘i* (fishponds) and *kula* (trade) networks  \n  – *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o): \"Eyes of the Pāo‘o\" (pāo‘o = a type of fish or a term for \"to be still\"). May allude to the *pāo‘o* (a sacred fish in Hawaiian mythology) or the concept of *pō* (night, darkness), hinting at a transition from traditional *mo‘okūauhau* (genealogical knowledge) to post-contact Christian symbolism  \n\n• Historical and cultural context  \n  – The reference to \"ali‘i nui lāua\" (great chiefs of Hawai‘i) aligns with the *Ai Kapu* era (pre-contact), where ali‘i were considered divine and their names carried sacred weight  \n  – The structure \"makua kāne (father) a keiki (child)\" of the two names may allegorically represent the collapse of the kapu system (1819) and the rise of new social hierarchies under missionary influence (post-1820)  \n  – The term \"pule\" (prayer) could indicate a shift toward Christian liturgy, as missionaries replaced traditional *kīmoemoe* (rituals) with biblical practices, though the name *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* retains pre-contact elements of *maka* (eyes) as a metaphor for spiritual vision  \n\n• Numerical symbolism and riddles  \n  – \"Kēlā mau inoa ‘elua\" (those two names) emphasizes the number two, a sacred number in Hawaiian cosmology (e.g., *two great gods*: Wakea and Ho‘ohokukoa). The duality may symbolize the merging of *maui* (earth) and *lani* (sky) in the creation narrative  \n  – The recursive structure of the names (e.g., *Nāmakaokalani* and *Nāmakaokai‘a*) mirrors the *kumu* (source) and *‘ōlelo* (language) in Hawaiian thought, where repetition reinforces spiritual power  \n\n• Post-contact influences and biases  \n  – The phrase \"ua komo i loko o ka pule\" (they are in the prayer) may reflect missionary-era reinterpretations of traditional *kīmoemoe* (rituals) as \"prayers,\" erasing pre-contact *kāne* (male) and *wahine* (female) roles in favor of a singular divine authority  \n  – The names \"Nāmakaokalani\" and \"Nāmakaokai‘a\" could have been altered to align with Christian symbolism, though their roots in *maka* (eyes) and *lani* (sky) preserve older cosmological themes",

  "reference_translation": "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity."
