Then the mother resided there, and then he went to their house in Keahumoa, dwelling there. He was placed on the roof of the house, he was placed in the possession of the god and the sacred place, and dwelled there in peace on the roof of the house.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>At that time, he went to his mother to be hidden in the cave of Waipouli. Then the mother resided there, and then he went to their house in Keahumoa, dwelling there. He was placed on the roof of the house, he was placed in the possession of the god and the sacred place, and dwelled there in peace on the roof of the house.</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n**Paragraph 11:**  \n• The narrative continues to emphasize the protagonist’s (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o) transition from a state of concealment (in the cave of Waipouli) to a new phase of residence under the protection of sacred spaces (Keahumoa, \"roof of the house\"). This mirrors the structure of Hawaiian oral traditions where protagonists are often hidden or relocated to sacred or symbolic locations for safety or spiritual training.  \n– **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** (the eyes of the pāo’o fish): The name retains its allegorical connection to \"maka\" (eyes) and \"pāo’o\" (a type of fish), symbolizing perception or insight. The \"pāo’o\" here may also evoke the \"po’o\" (head), reinforcing themes of leadership or divine favor.  \n– **Waipouli**: A cave or sacred space, possibly linked to ancestral or ritual practices. Caves in Hawaiian lore often represent liminal zones between the physical and spiritual worlds, aligning with the \"hūnā\" (hidden) motif.  \n– **Keahumoa**: Translates to \"roof of the house,\" a term that could symbolize a place of authority or divine guardianship. The repetition of \"roof\" (kaupoku) in the text underscores its sacredness, a concept tied to *mo’olelo* (myths) where elevated spaces were reserved for ali’i (nobility) or deities.  \n– **Kau’oku (god) and moku (sacred place)**: The phrase \"kaupoku o ka hale\" (roof of the house) and \"moku\" (sacred place) reflects the integration of natural and spiritual realms. In the *’Ai Kapu* era, such spaces were governed by strict kapu (sacred laws), and placing the child here may signify his role as a bridge between human and divine.  \n• The act of \"placing him on the roof\" allegorically represents his elevation to a position of spiritual or political significance, contrasting with his earlier destructive behavior. This mirrors the symbolic dismantling of *’Ai Kapu* practices, where sacred spaces were redefined from restrictive to inclusive.  \n• The repetition of \"roof\" (kaupoku) may allude to the *mo’olelo* of *Kahiko* (ancient) traditions, where the roof symbolized the connection between earth and sky, and the child’s residence there signifies his alignment with higher powers.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
