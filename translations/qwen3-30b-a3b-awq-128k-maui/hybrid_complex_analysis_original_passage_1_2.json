Then Pōka‘ī adopted Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i went to his land, living in the home of Pōka‘ī and his adoption, and later was born. In this birth, there was a great child of Pōka‘ī and his child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "This passage is a genealogical or narrative text rooted in Hawaiian cultural traditions, emphasizing lineage, adoption, and the significance of place names. Below is a detailed breakdown:  \n\n1. **Cultural Context**:  \n   - **Adoption (hāpai)**: In traditional Hawaiian society, adoption was a common practice to ensure lineage continuity and social cohesion. The term \"hāpai\" here reflects this cultural norm, highlighting the importance of familial bonds beyond biological ties.  \n   - **Place Names**: \"Ewa\" refers to a district on O‘ahu, historically significant for its role in Hawaiian settlement and genealogy. \"Hō‘ae‘ae\" and \"Kauluakaha‘i\" are likely names of ancestors or figures, underscoring the interplay between geography and identity in Hawaiian narratives.  \n   - **Lineage and Ancestry**: The repetition of names like \"Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" (possibly a variation of \"Nāmaka\" meaning \"sea\" or \"wave\") and the phrase \"kāna keiki\" (his child) suggest a focus on familial and spiritual connections, aligning with the Hawaiian concept of *ʻāina* (land) as a living entity tied to ancestry.  \n\n2. **Linguistic Features**:  \n   - **Topicalization**: The structure \"Ma kēia hānau ‘ana\" (In this birth) uses topicalization, a common Hawaiian syntactic feature to emphasize the subject or location.  \n   - **Possessive Pronouns**: \"Launa\" (their) and \"kona\" (his) demonstrate the use of possessive markers to denote relationships between individuals and their lands/children.  \n   - **Verbs and Tenses**: The verbs \"hānau\" (to be born) and \"hāpai\" (to adopt) are in their base forms, with context indicating past actions. The phrase \"noho ihola\" (living in the home) uses the verb \"noho\" (to dwell) with the locative suffix \"-ihola,\" reflecting the importance of spatial relationships in Hawaiian syntax.  \n   - **Reduplication**: Names like \"Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" use reduplication (e.g., \"pāo‘o\" from \"pā‘o\" meaning \"to be born\") to emphasize or denote specific traits, a hallmark of Hawaiian naming conventions.  \n\n3. **Historical Significance**:  \n   - **Genealogical Records**: The text mirrors the structure of *mo‘olelo* (stories) or *kilo‘oko* (genealogies) that trace lineage and ancestral connections. The mention of \"Ewa\" ties the narrative to a specific geographic and cultural region, which was central to Hawaiian settlement patterns.  \n   - **Ancestral Roles**: Names like \"Pōka‘ī\" and \"Kauluakaha‘i\" may correspond to historical figures or deities, with \"Kauluakaha‘i\" possibly linked to the *Kaharoa* (ancestors) of the *Kānaka‘ōlewa* (Hawaiian people). The act of adoption here may symbolize the transfer of *mana* (spiritual power) or *kuleana* (responsibility) between generations.  \n   - **Spiritual Connection to Land**: The phrase \"ma ‘Ewa ka ‘āina\" (in Ewa the land) reflects the Hawaiian worldview where land is not just a physical space but a *moʻolele* (ancestor) with which people have a reciprocal relationship.  \n\n4. **Symbolism and Structure**:  \n   - The passage uses parallelism (\"ma laila lāua i launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o\") to link birth, dwelling, and discovery, suggesting a cyclical or interconnected narrative of existence.  \n   - The repetition of \"hānau\" (birth) and \"kino\" (children) reinforces themes of continuity and renewal, central to Hawaiian cosmology.  \n   - The final sentence, \"he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘ī a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o,\" (In this birth, there was a great child of Pōka‘ī and his child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o) may allude to a significant figure (e.g., a chief or deity) born from the adoption, blending biological and social lineage.  \n\nThis text likely originates from a *mo‘olelo* (oral tradition) or *kilo‘oko* (genealogical record) of the 19th or early 20th century, preserving pre-colonial Hawaiian values of kinship, land stewardship, and the sacredness of ancestral ties. The language retains archaic structures, such as the use of \"iā\" (to/for) with the object, reflecting older Hawaiian syntax.",

  "reference_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",

When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
