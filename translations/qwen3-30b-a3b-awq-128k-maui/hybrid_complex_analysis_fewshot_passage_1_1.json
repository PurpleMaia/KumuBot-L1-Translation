The term *pāo'o* refers to a type of fish, and *maka* (eyes) may symbolize perception or spiritual awareness.  \n– **b1)** His father, **Kau-ulu-a-kaha'i** (possibly \"expanding growth of Kaha'i\"), a *makua kāne* (father) from **Kahikipapaialewa** (a place in **Kahikinu'u**, the \"summit of Kahiki,\" a term often referencing foreign lands or the spiritual realm).  \n– **c)** The father’s status as a **great chief** (*ali'i nui*) tied to **Kahikipapaialewa**, suggesting a lineage of leadership and sacred authority.  \n– **b2)** His mother, **Pō-ka-'ī** (possibly \"night falls upon the high chief\"), a name evoking imagery of darkness or mystery, possibly linked to ancestral or spiritual forces.  \n– **c)** The mother’s name *Pōka'ī* may symbolize the cyclical nature of time or the interplay between day and night, reflecting the balance of life and death in Hawaiian cosmology.  \n• The phrase *i ka 'u'uku a me ke koa loa* (\"in the strength and bravery of the ulua\") may allude to the *ulua* fish, which in *Ai Kapu* era rituals symbolized human sacrifice. Here, it could metaphorically represent the protagonist’s destructive potential, contrasting with the sacred *Ai Kapu* practices of the past.  \n• The mention of *Kahikipapaialewa* and *Kahikinu'u* (the \"summit of Kahiki\") reflects the hierarchical and spiritual geography of Hawaii, where *Kahiki* often denoted foreign lands or the afterlife. The father’s role as a *pālupalu* (priest) of a *kekahi ona* (certain god) ties him to the religious elite of the *Ai Kapu* era, emphasizing his divine connection.  \n• The name *Kauluakaha'i* may derive from *kaha'i* (to grow, expand), suggesting a lineage of growth or prosperity, while *Pōka'ī* could symbolize the cyclical nature of existence, aligning with Hawaiian concepts of *mo‘olelo* (history) as an eternal, repeating process.  \n• The absence of specific numbers (e.g., 2, 4, 40) in this paragraph contrasts with Example 2, but the emphasis on *‘u‘uku* (fish) and *koa loa* (bravery) retains the symbolic depth of Hawaiian storytelling, where natural elements often represent human traits or divine will.\"",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;"
