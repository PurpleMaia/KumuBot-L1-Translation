Ama'u came to the people of Ewa, to take the full strength of Nāmakaokapāo'o, no one is like you, and to make a fight with Ama'u. Now, O'ahu is with Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then, he looked to his wife and fought on the land of O'ahu.",
  "qwen3-30b-a3b-awq-128k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>The story of Ama'u, who was known for his strong canoes, and he went down to Ewa to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o. Ama'u came to the people of Ewa, to take the full strength of Nāmakaokapāo'o, no one is like you, and to make a fight with Ama'u. Now, O'ahu is with Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then, he looked to his wife and fought on the land of O'ahu.</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n• **Paragraph 14:**  \n– **Narrative Context:** This passage introduces Ama'u, a figure associated with strength and warfare, as he travels to Ewa (a region in O'ahu) to confront Nāmakaokapāo'o, a recurring character from earlier chapters. The phrase \"ho'omākaukau ihola\" (famous for his strong canoes) highlights Ama'u’s martial prowess, linking him to the tradition of seafaring and combat in pre-unification Hawaii.  \n– **Cultural Practice:** The act of \"e noke mai ana 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o i ka luku ā pau loa\" (to take the full strength of Nāmakaokapāo'o) may allude to the ritual of \"kūpuna\" (ancestral strength) or \"ho'okipa\" (to take as a challenge), where warriors sought to overpower opponents to assert dominance. The phrase \"a'ohe kanaka koe\" (no one is like you) reflects the Hawaiian concept of \"mālama ʻōlelo\" (respect for language) and the emphasis on individual valor, a key theme in the *Ai Kapu* era, where strength and lineage determined social status.  \n– **Symbolic Action:** \"Ho'onoho ihola i luna o ka 'āina O'ahu nei\" (to fight on the land of O'ahu) symbolizes the clash between rival chiefs or factions over territorial control. The land of O'ahu, historically a contested region, represents the physical and spiritual battleground for power. The reference to \"kona makuahine\" (his wife) suggests Ama'u’s personal stake in the conflict, tying familial loyalty to warfare.  \n– **Allegorical Interpretation:** Ama'u’s journey to Ewa and his confrontation with Nāmakaokapāo'o may allegorically represent the tension between centralized authority and localized power struggles during the pre-unification period. The \"strong canoes\" (wa'a kaua) could symbolize naval dominance, while \"fighting on the land\" (ho'onoho ihola) underscores the transition from seafaring to terrestrial conflict, reflecting the dual nature of Hawaiian warfare. The phrase \"a'ohe kanaka koe\" (no one is like you) may critique the hubris of warriors who overestimate their strength, a common theme in Hawaiian narratives about the consequences of defying kapu (sacred laws).  \n– **Name Etymology:**  \n– *Ama'u* (Ama'u): Possibly derived from *ama* (to fight, to struggle) or *amaʻu* (to be strong, to endure), emphasizing his role as a warrior.  \n– *Nāmakaokapāo'o* (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o): \"Nā maka\" (eyes) and \"ka pāo'o\" (a type of fish, also a poetic term for \"head\"). The name may symbolize Nāmakaokapāo'o’s connection to the ocean and his earlier destruction of sweet potato patches (as in Example 3), linking him to the \"Ai Kapu\" tradition of resource control and ritual sacrifice.  \n– **Historical Context:** Ewa and O'ahu were regions where conflicts over land and resources were frequent. The mention of \"kona po'e kānaka ma 'Ewa\" (the people of Ewa) highlights the communal aspect of warfare, where leaders mobilized their communities for battle, a practice rooted in the *mo'okūauhau* (genealogical) and *moolelo* (history) traditions of Hawaiian society.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
