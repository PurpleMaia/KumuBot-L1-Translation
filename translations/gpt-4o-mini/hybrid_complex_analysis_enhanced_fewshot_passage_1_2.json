  "gpt-4o-mini_translation": "“Hō‘ae‘ae is the land in ‘Ewa, where they engaged in physical intimacy with the procreation of Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Pōka‘ī became pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land, while Pōka‘ī lived with her pregnancy, and afterward, she gave birth. In this birth, Pōka‘ī was extremely impoverished, along with her child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”",
  "gpt-4o-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 2:** \n• The passage introduces an essential thematic element of Hawaiian stories: the connection between place and relationship. The name **Hō‘ae‘ae** (from the root 'hō‘ae' which means 'fertile' or 'productive') indicates a location abundant with resources, tied to the acts of procreation and intimacy that lead to birthing a significant character, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.\n  \n– The reference to **‘Ewa** (which translates to 'the set of desired things'); depicts a geographic context that serves as the backdrop for the protagonists' relationship and represents historical land affiliations which were significant in traditional Hawaiian society.  \n  \n• The phrase **launa kino ai** translates as 'to engage in physical intimacy,' a euphemism that reflects the sacredness of the union in Hawaiian culture, accentuating the importance of procreation and lineage, commonly revered themes in the context of Hawaiian mythology and genealogy.\n  \n– This could also suggest a broader cultural practice where private matters such as intimacy are openly acknowledged in folklore, reinforcing familial connections and human relationships through storytelling.\n\n• **Hāpai** (to become pregnant) emphasizes the significant roles of women in Hawaiian culture, as the act of bearing children is highly regarded. **Pōka‘ī** (potentially alluding to 'pile or heap from the uniqueness of the night') thus takes center stage. The characterization of Pōka‘ī as **‘ilihune loa** (extremely impoverished) serves to highlight contrasts within the narrative—a common literary device within the tradition to provoke empathy and explore the struggles of characters in their sacred quests.\n\n– Pōka‘ī’s poverty suggests themes of resilience and determination frequently encountered in Hawaiian mythology, where an “ali‘i” (chief) may face trials that test their strength and integrity. The plight of her and her son reveals the complexities of motherhood and the socioeconomic conditions of early Hawaiian society. \n\n• This birth narrative also places strong emphasis on the lineage of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, marking him not merely as a child but as a progenitor of significant socio-cultural implications. The involving of **Kauluakaha‘i** (the hero or vanquisher of Kaha‘i, echoing traits of a demigod) returning to his own land while Pōka‘ī remains with child encapsulates the dynamics of gender roles of the time where men might venture away for responsibilities while women often maintained family and domestic ties. \n\n– The return of Kauluakaha‘i to his land might symbolize the cyclical nature of Hawaiian cosmology, intertwining liberation and the obligations tied to one’s location. There is an interconnectedness to migrate, explore, and the responsibilities that arise from familial ties, anchoring the tale within the broader framework of Hawaiian values correlating with land, family, and identity.",

  "reference_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
