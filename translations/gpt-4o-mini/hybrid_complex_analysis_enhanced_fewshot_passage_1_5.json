The body of Nāmakaokapāo‘o at that time was quite small, with two skies (clouds) and half of his height not firm, and he was swaying. When they arrived at the sweet potato patch, he told the children, “Pull up the mounds and all the sweet potato leaves on top, do not leave any that can still grow.” However, the children were afraid, thus they quietly stood by the sweet potatoes, and did not pluck the mounds.",
  "gpt-4o-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:** \n• The introductory actions set a significant tone for Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a character still in formative years yet taking initiative to lead ten children to Puali‘i’s sweet potato patches, embodying traits of leadership and a degree of authority. His name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, suggests \"The Eyes of the Pāo'o fish,\" perhaps referring to keen insight or awareness of his surroundings, indicative of his leadership role, albeit among younger companions.\n  \n• The detailed description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o reveals both his physicality and his vulnerability: \n  – \"he kino ‘u‘uku loa\" (a very small body), indicates he is still a child, emphasizing themes of innocence and growth.\n  – The phrase \"elua kapua‘i\" (two clouds), metaphorically might refer to his potential or ideas that are not yet fully formed, suggesting his capability is still emerging, hinting at duality in his character which may evolve throughout the narrative.\n  – The phrase \"hapa kona ki‘eki‘e\" (half of his height not firm) indicates lack of maturity and instability—both physically and perhaps emotionally—hinting at a transitional phase in childhood. \"E lewalewa ana nō\" (was swaying) symbolizes unsteadiness, emblematic of the childish recklessness or naïveté which is often present in youth coming into their own.\n\n• The interaction with the children is telling:\n  – \"E huhuki i ka pu‘e\" (pull up the mounds), is not merely an instruction but tied strongly to agricultural practices, specifically the harvesting traditions associated with the sweet potato (uala), a staple of Hawaiian sustenance. This relates to the 'Ai Kapu era where land management and cultivation were sacred and tied closely to community survival.\n  – The command to not leave any \"that can still grow\" speaks to a sense of urgency or perhaps desperation, indicating a lack of understanding of sustainable practices among his young companions. This contrasts with traditional wisdom, showcasing the potential conflicts between youthful impulse and the wisdom often borne from experience.\n  \n• The children's fear:\n  – The phrase \"makau nō ua keiki\" (the children were afraid) introduces a critical perspective of the young characters, highlighting their hesitation to engage in what is a typically necessary agricultural practice, thus perhaps foreshadowing future events of resistance to leadership or established norms. Their reluctance to act showcases youthful inexperience and their vulnerability in the face of potential consequences of their actions.\n  – \"kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala\" (thus they quietly stood by the sweet potatoes), presents a poignant image of passivity amidst uncertainty. This passivity contrasts sharply with Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s initiative, hinting at potential themes of leadership, accountability, and the burden of expectation versus the fear of consequence within community dynamics.\n\nThis passage effectively serves as an allegory for growth, responsibility, and the interplay between youthful bravado and the collective wisdom of the community, highlighting critical tensions in the pursuit of tradition versus genuine learning.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
