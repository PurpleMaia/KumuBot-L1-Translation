All the children saw and they ran off, standing in a long line out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, 'Behold! Here is the ko‘ilipi in my hand; it is for cutting off your head today and severing your head, then I will roast it with the sweet potato and eat it first, and then be free.' Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not heed the words of Puali‘i, then Puali‘i spoke again, 'This will be the pit.' Puali‘i was ready to cut Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the ko‘ilipi at the time Nāmakaokapāo‘o was praying for his death concerning Puali‘i. Instead, his prayer went: 'Only the eyes of my pāo‘o friend, I receive, I shall crave for, shall consume, shall be left behind, shall be left behind, the one who is Nākukui‘aimakaokalani, Kukui‘aimakaokalani is that, my love, Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i, let it be, let the spear be but a mere poke, the people indeed with the spear, the spear indeed with the drum, death is certain for Nāmakaokapāo‘o.'\"",
  "gpt-4o-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:** \n• In this passage, the narrative escalates with a direct confrontation between Puali‘i and Nāmakaokapāo‘o, emphasizing themes of violence and fear within personal relationships. \n– **Puali‘i** (a name that means \"to gather or collect\") embodies the role of the aggressor, while **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (the eyes of the pāo‘o fish) represents a target of Puali‘i's wrath. The notion of a knife (**ko‘ilipi**) in his hand signals a rite of passage, indicative of a potential act of revenge or resolution of personal conflict.\n• The cultural context here highlights the significance of **ko‘ilipi**, traditionally a tool for both practical use and ceremonial functions, including the slaying of a pig for offerings, linking to sacrificial practices in the 'Ai Kapu era.\n– The act of preparing sweet potatoes on fire has implications beyond mere sustenance; it also acts as a symbolic preparation for violence—cooking food associated with the land while simultaneously threatening death. Sweet potato growth represents sustenance and prosperity in Hawaiian culture, but the twist of imminent violence underscores the significant tensions between the characters.\n• The children witnessing the encounter and fleeing in fear illustrates societal expectations regarding bravery and cowardice, suggesting that fear of violence can override communal bonds—an important lesson in traditional Hawaiian values.\n• Puali‘i's words reflect a sense of urgency and determination, highlighting the ‘Ākau (North) direction of action—signifying a goal-oriented mindset often associated with malevolent intentions. The exactness of his threats underscores the single-minded ambition to sever ties with Nāmakaokapāo‘o through both literal and symbolic destruction.\n• Additionally, the prayer recited by Nāmakaokapāo‘o before his impending demise reflects deeper cultural beliefs surrounding life, death, and the interconnectedness of relationships. The invocation of names like **Nākukui‘aimakaokalani** and **Kukui‘aimakaokalani** indicates a connection to celestial ancestors or deities, reinforcing their protective and vengeful attributes.\n– The phrasing highlights the intertwined relationship dynamics of love, violence, and mortality, which are recurrent themes in traditional Hawaiian lore, suggesting that one’s affection (or adversarial feelings) can possess transformative power.\n• Ultimately, the passage conveys the intense themes of rivalry and potential violence against the backdrop of familial expectations and societal hierarchies, reflecting the complexities of interaction and allegiance that characterize Hawaiian folklore.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
