  "gpt-4o-mini_translation": "Ama'u heard and prepared his war canoes, twelve of them, and sailed south to engage in battle with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When Ama'u and his people arrived in 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o was busy exterminating all the people; there was no one left, and Ama'u died. O'ahu was then encircled by Nāmakaokapāo'o, and he then took his mother and established himself on the land of O'ahu.",
  "gpt-4o-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

'Ewa is historically known as a site of conflict and strategic importance, as it is located on the leeward side of O'ahu, making it a prime target for battles in the 'Ai Kapu era when land rights and resource control were vital.\n• Nāmakaokapāo'o's extermination of all the people in 'Ewa can be interpreted as a brutal tactic, showcasing the ferocity of his character, possibly serving as a warning of the consequences of defiance against the powerful. This act of eradicating his enemies aligns with traditional tales of war, where total victory often meant the complete subjugation of foes.\n• The passage culminates with Nāmakaokapāo'o encircling O'ahu and returning to his mother, a moment that can imply both filial piety and his subsequent transformation from a warrior to a ruler. \n– His act of establishing himself on O'ahu after taking his mother implies a new phase of governance where familial ties play a pivotal role, stressing the importance of matrilineal connections in Hawaiian culture where lineage often dictated authority and power. \n• Furthermore, the resolution of Ama'u’s conflict emphasizes the harsh realities of warfare in ancient Hawai'i where the defeat could lead to irreversible changes in leadership and territorial control, thus influencing broader socio-political structures within the Hawaiian archipelago. This narrative effectively weaves themes of strength, strategy, familial ties, and the grave consequences of warfare into the rich tapestry of Hawaiian mythology and historical storytelling.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
