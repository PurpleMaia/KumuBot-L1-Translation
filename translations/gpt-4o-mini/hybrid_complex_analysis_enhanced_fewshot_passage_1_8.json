  "gpt-4o-mini_translation": "“Now I will speak briefly of those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, who were both great chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani was the father of Nāmakaokai‘a, but they were brought into the chant of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”",
  "gpt-4o-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:** \n• This passage introduces two significant characters, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, both identified as ali‘i nui (high chiefs) of Hawai‘i. \n  – **Nāmakaokalani** (the eyes of heaven): suggests a divine or elevated status, with “nāmaka” referring to \"eyes\" or \"sight,\" and “kalani” connoting \"heaven\" or \"sky.\" This name implies a chief whose presence is heavenly or authoritative, reinforcing his high status and possibly divine ancestry.\n  – **Nāmakaokai‘a** (the eyes of the sea): similarly employs the term “nāmaka,” with “kai‘a” indicating \"the sea.\" This suggests a connection to the ocean, which has immense cultural and practical significance in Hawaiian life, including navigation, subsistence, and spirituality. The ocean, as a name element, may symbolize adaptability, depth, and resourcefulness.\n• The relationship between Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a is critical: \n  – Nāmakaokalani is described as the father of Nāmakaokai‘a, establishing a lineage that is important in Hawaiian culture, where genealogy often denotes status and identity.\n  – The mention of familial ties indicates the strong influence of kinship in Hawaiian society, particularly amongst the ali‘i, where lineage determines power dynamics and social roles.\n• The reference to their materials being brought into the pule (chant) of Nāmakaokapāo‘o indicates the importance of storytelling and oral traditions in preserving history and culture: \n  – Chanting (pule) is a sacred practice that honors and remembers ancestors, significant events, and legends. This inclusion signifies that the contributions or stories of these ali‘i were considered essential in the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, suggesting a lineage of power, legacy, and potential conflict or unity. \n• Nāmakaokapāo‘o, likely the central figure in this narrative, appears to be a bridge connecting these two notable ali‘i, thus bringing forth themes of legacy, conflict, and resolution relevant in Hawaiian tradition, where ancestry and stories often intertwine to create a rich tapestry of cultural identity.",

  "reference_translation": "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity."
