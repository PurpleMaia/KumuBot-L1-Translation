  "gpt-4o-mini_translation": "Aloha, so he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. Then the mother disappeared, and they returned to their home at Keahumoa, where they stayed. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed to the roof of the house and pulled back the grass of the roof and lay down in the space above the roof.",
  "gpt-4o-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Aloha, so he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. Then the mother disappeared, and they returned to their home at Keahumoa, where they stayed. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed to the roof of the house and pulled back the grass of the roof and lay down in the space above the roof.</translation>\n\n<commentary>**Paragraph 11:** \n• This paragraph shows a continuation of Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions and the protective relationship with his mother, indicating a critical turning point in their narrative arc. \n• Relevant names and places include:\n   1) **Waipouli** (water of the sweet potato): potentially symbolic of nourishment and protection since it is the hiding place for his mother.\n   2) **Keahumoa** (pile of chickens): could suggest an abundance of resources or safety as a homestead where they return.\n   3) **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** (the eyes of the pāo'o fish): signifies vision and insight, possibly hinting at foresight in his actions.\n• The act of hiding his mother in the cave can be appreciated as an act reinforced by the cultural importance of protecting one’s family, illustrating values central to Hawaiian culture, such as 'ohana (family) and mālama (to take care). Caves are often seen as sacred places and serve as refuge, hinting at themes of survival and safety in Hawaiian storytelling.\n• The return to Keahumoa indicates a return to a place of security, emphasizing the significance of home as a sanctuary in the narrative context.\n• Nāmakaokapāo'o's climbing onto the roof and pulling back the grass reflects a desire for oversight or vigilance over his surroundings; this act might symbolize yearning for freedom or a broader perspective on life. The roof itself, in typical Hawaiian architecture, represents shelter while the act of lying down signifies a moment of rest or contemplation atop the physical and metaphorical protective space of his home.\n• This passage evokes 'Ai Kapu themes in its focus on familial relationships and protective duties while juxtaposing the innocent yet bold ventures of Nāmakaokapāo'o in an emerging conflictual narrative.\n• The imagery of grass may also invoke ideas of life, growth, and sustainability—elements that are critical in discussing agricultural practices prevalent in pre-colonial Hawaiian society. Essentially, each act carried out by Nāmakaokapāo'o is laden with cultural significance, reflecting an intricate balance between action and contemplation in Hawaiian ethos.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
