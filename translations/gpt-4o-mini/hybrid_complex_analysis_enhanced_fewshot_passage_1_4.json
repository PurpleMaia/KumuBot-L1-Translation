  "gpt-4o-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:** \n• The scene opens with a description of Nāmakaokapāo'o's connection to the land, indicating his agricultural operations: \"Noho ihola i laila, mahi 'ai\" (He was living there, farming). \n– This indicates a sustained relationship between the protagonist and the sacred practice of cultivation, which is central to Hawaiian life and spirituality. \n– The mention of the \"mau māla 'uala lō'ihi\" (long sweet potato patches) emphasizes agricultural stewardship and abundance, foundational elements of Hawaiian subsistence.\n\n• The sweet potatoes are notably named after Nāmakaokapāo'o, which reflects the traditional Hawaiian practice of assigning significant names to land and crops, often as a means of honoring cultural heritage. \n– The etymology of “Nāmakaokapāo‘o” (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) suggests a connection to strength, oversight, and the remarkable traits of this mythical creature, indicating that these patches are not merely crops but embedded with identity and legacy.\n\n• Puali'i's declaration: \"Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala\" (There are two heads, one of the ulua and one of the sweet potato) introduces an invitation to ritual and symbolic consumption.\n– The ulua (Caranx ignobilis) here represents strength and is intricately tied to the concept of ‘Ai Kapu, a time when food sharing between genders was regulated, highlighting societal norms around gender roles in subsistence and food gathering.\n\n• He states, “a ‘ai ‘o Puali‘i” (and he eats), which can be interpreted as a challenge to the norms by stating that he will partake in what is traditionally reserved for certain circumstances (indicating that he breaks from the norm).\n– “Pōka‘ī a me nā mea ‘ē a‘e” suggests that Puali'i’s actions are meant not only for himself but to also provide for his women and others, demonstrating hospitality and generosity; both key Hawaiian values.\n\n• The directive to “iho akula ‘o Puali‘i i kai o Honouliuli” (Puali‘i went down to the coast of Honouliuli) emphasizes both movement and community. \n– The name Honouliuli (dark bay) indicates a specific geographical locale, enhancing the narrative’s ties to real places, thus grounding mythic narratives in physical geography. \n– The act of going to gather \"i‘a ‘ai pū\" (to fish for food with the sweet potatoes) illustrates a blending of agricultural and oceanic resources, reinforcing the interconnectedness of land and sea in Hawaiian cosmology.\n\n• Overall, this segment illustrates the balance between traditional practices of farming and fishing, highlighting Puali'i's embodiment of the resourceful Hawaiian spirit. It frames the characters within a critical cultural space where nourishment, societal roles, and identity intertwine, resonating with historical practices and modern sensibilities around land stewardship and sustainability rooted in Hawaiian ideologies.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
