  "gpt-4o-mini_translation": "While they were living together, Puali'i, a good man from Līhu'e, came down to fish at the shore of Honouliuli and visited the home of Pōka'ī. He looked at Pōka'ī and liked her, saying, \"I would like you to be my woman.\" Pōka'ī replied, \"How could you want me? I have given birth to a child and my body is ruined.\" Puali'i said, \"Those things are nothing. If you like me, let us be together.\" Pōka'ī agreed. Then she returned with her partner Puali'i to the fields of Keahumoa to live.",
  "gpt-4o-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 1:** \n• This passage introduces Puali'i, a man characterized as \"a good man\" (kanaka maika'i), suggesting qualities of kindness and morality, attributes highly valued in Hawaiian culture. The location, Līhu'e, situates him historically and geographically, emphasizing his connection to a specific community and identity. \n\n• The setting of Honouliuli (dark bay) and its significance as a fishing ground illustrates the deep relationship Hawaiians have maintained with the sea as a provider of sustenance. Fishing is not merely an economic activity but a cultural practice connected to heritage and sustenance, particularly among the Hawaiian people who have relied on these resources for generations.\n\n**Paragraph 2:**\n• Puali'i's visit to Pōka'ī's home signals a customary social interaction in Native Hawaiian culture, where sharing food and visiting neighbors reflects the values of ‘ohana (family) and mana (spiritual power). This is in line with the etiquette that was common during the 'Ai Kapu era, which stressed community, sharing, and hospitality.\n\n• When Puali'i expresses his desire for Pōka'ī to be his wahine (woman), it underscores the expectations surrounding romantic and social relationships in Hawaiian society, often marked by partnerships that involve more than mere affection but also community recognition and familial ties.\n\n**Paragraph 3:**\n• Pōka'ī's response, highlighting her perceived flaws—her motherhood and the change in her body—reveals a culturally contextual perspective of beauty and femininity. In traditional Hawaiian culture, physical attributes and the ability to bear children are significant, yet they also weigh heavily on women's self-esteem—a duality that Pōka'ī grapples with. The phrase “ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino” (my body is ruined) reflects a societal pressure on women to maintain a certain image, which is still relevant today.\n\n• Puali'i’s reassuring response, “He mea ‘ole ia mau mea” (those things are nothing), emphasizes his inclination to look beyond physical appearance and past circumstances. This reinforces themes of compassion and understanding in relationships, connected to the value placed on inner qualities over superficial attributes in Hawaiian cultural discourse.\n\n**Paragraph 4:**\n• The agreement between Pōka'ī and Puali'i to be together indicates a resolution of doubts regarding her worthiness as a partner. Her decision to return to the fields of Keahumoa with him signifies an acceptance of familial bonds and cultural practices surrounding marriage, where the relationship involves not just the two individuals but their respective families and communities.\n\n• Keahumoa, meaning ‘the “heap of chickens,” reflects both a physical place and a metaphor for abundance and fertility. This deeply connects the narrative back to themes of sustenance and agrarian life central to Hawaiian culture, underscoring how the land and community are interwoven into personal relationships. Thus, Pōka'ī’s movement toward a life with Puali'i also symbolizes rebirth and new beginnings, milestones in the cycle of life rooted in Hawaiian tradition.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
