  "gpt-4o-mini_translation": "“Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ‘I know that Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great man, and he has gone over to Ko'olau, and I am that name for him.’ They replied, ‘No, it is you; that is what we have heard, therefore you will die for us, you will not live.’ Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ‘Let’s go down and fight.’ When they reached the bottom, Nāmakaokapāo'o was killing, completely finishing off his foes, and there was only one man left, who fled far away to 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He spoke of the death of all of them, except for him, who was the only survivor who could hear from 'Ama'u.”",
  "gpt-4o-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>“Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ‘I know that Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great man, and he has gone over to Ko'olau, and I am that name for him.’ They replied, ‘No, it is you; that is what we have heard, therefore you will die for us, you will not live.’ Nāmakaokapāo'o said, ‘Let’s go down and fight.’ When they reached the bottom, Nāmakaokapāo'o was killing, completely finishing off his foes, and there was only one man left, who fled far away to 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He spoke of the death of all of them, except for him, who was the only survivor who could hear from 'Ama'u.”</translation>\n\n<commentary>**Paragraph 13:** \n• This paragraph continues the narrative involving Nāmakaokapāo'o, highlighting his strength and asserting his identity as a significant figure. The exchange between him and the others illustrates both his awareness and a foreshadowing of conflict—a common theme in Hawaiian storytelling that emphasizes identity, strength, and the communal perceptions of individuals; \n– Nāmakaokapāo'o begins by claiming an understanding of his own significance: “I know that Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great man...” His assertion reflects a form of self-actualization common in Hawaiian culture, where personal and communal identity is deeply intertwined;\n• The response from the others is telling: “No, it is you; that is what we have heard...” Here, we see elements of peer perception and folklore messaging, suggesting that Nāmakaokapāo'o’s name has become synonymous with prowess and danger. This implies that his very existence commands respect and fear in equal measure;\n• The statement “therefore you will die for us, you will not live” hints at the heavy cost of warfare or conflict, turning the stakes of the narrative into a matter of life and death, a pressing theme throughout Hawaiian history in times of strife and warfare;\n• The call to action from Nāmakaokapāo'o— “Let’s go down and fight”—demonstrates not just courage but a strategic move within the narrative, positioning him as a leader and warrior, prepared to challenge fate or the challenges at hand;\n• The imagery of “killing, completely finishing off his foes” illustrates a fierce and relentless nature, symbolizing the potentially destructive force of mana (spiritual power) that Nāmakaokapāo'o embodies within the context of conflict, which is emphasized by the abruptness of the conflict's outcome;\n– The reference to the lone survivor who fled to 'Ama'u in Waikīkī indicates a narrative closure, perhaps serving as a caution or reflection on the violence experienced in warfare. 'Ama'u (possibly referring to the region or a person) here acts as both a geographical marker and a symbolic refuge for the last man alive, indicating themes of survival against overwhelming odds;\n– This fragment also reinforces the motif of isolation in conflict, where only one remains to tell the tale—a common narrative structure that reflects the fragile nature of life and legacy in Hawaiian narratives, as well as the unrelenting cycle of conflict.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
