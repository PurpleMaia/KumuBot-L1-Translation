He paid a visit to the home of Pōka'ī and looked at her and liked her. He said, \"I'd like you to be my woman.\" Pōka'ī replied, \"How could you possibly want me? I've given birth to a child and my body is ruined.\" Puali'i said, \"I don't care about that. If you like me, let's sleep together.\" Pōka'ī agreed and she went with Puali'i, now her man, to the plains of Keahumoa to live.",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "• **Paragraph 3:** A new character is introduced, Pua-li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu'e (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in 'Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-'ī was living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. – In the 'Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to every destination and it was normal to call in to the house of strangers and ask for food and water. It was normal to receive strangers at one's home and provide them with food and water, and it was considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the reason Pua-li'i called in at Pōka'ī's house and why Pōka'ī received Pua-li'i in her home, where he observed how she was living; \n• Pua-li'i falls in love with Pō-ka-'ī and proposes a longterm relationship. Pō-ka-'ī expresses hesitation due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li'i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and acknowledge each other as ʻkāne' (boyfriend, husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine' (girlfriend, wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu'e (Wāhiāwā), where Pua-li'i is from, to live; \n• It seems the meal Pua-li'i proposed, with the cooked head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of 'Ai Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their longterm relationship;\n\n• **Name Analysis:**\n    – *Puali'i*:  Derived from *pua* (flower, blossom) and *-li'i* (descendant, offspring), suggesting a connection to leadership or lineage. It implies he is a descendant of chiefs or has a noble standing. \n    – *Pōka'ī*:  The etymology is less direct but possibly linked to 'pō' meaning darkness, night, and 'kā'i' meaning to fall or descend. Could be interpreted as someone who carries the burden of darkness, hardship, or misfortune; potentially alluding to her current state after giving birth, or a deeper connection to ancestral suffering.\n\n• **Cultural Context:**\n    – The act of Puali’i seeking permission to enter Pōka'ī’s home and being received with hospitality reflects the importance of *ʻai kapu* customs during that period. It highlights a societal expectation of generosity and reciprocal relationships, especially when traveling. \n    –  The statement \"He mea 'ole ia mau mea\" (That doesn't matter) from Puali'i regarding Pōka'ī having given birth to a child and feeling diminished is significant. This implies he disregards the social stigma surrounding childbirth or perhaps views her differently than others might, potentially indicating deeper affection or admiration.\n\n• **Symbolism & Interpretation:**\n    – The immediate proposal of a relationship after observing Pō-ka-'ī's life suggests a directness that aligns with some historical portrayals of relationships in Hawaiian stories, where needs and desires were expressed openly. This contrasts with the more indirect courtship rituals prevalent in Western cultures.",
