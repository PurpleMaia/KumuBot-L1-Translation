  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_translation": "The land of Hōʻaeʻae was in ʻEwa, and so they became intimate and slept, and Nāmakaokapāoʻo was conceived. Pōkaʻī cherished Nāmakaokapāoʻo, and Kauluakahaʻi returned to his land, and Pōkaʻī resided there with her beloved, and afterward, she gave birth. With this birth, Pōkaʻī and her child, Nāmakaokapāoʻo, were very fortunate.",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 2:** • This paragraph establishes the foundational moment of Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s origin within a specific geographical location – ‘Ewa. The emphasis on intimacy and sleep immediately sets the stage for his divine conception, linking his existence to the land itself. The phrase \"launa kino ai me ka moe 'ana iho\" is significant; it implies not just physical union but also a deep, almost spiritual connection that resulted in gestation.\n\n– **‘Ewa:** This location is important as it's often associated with the transition between the earthly realm and the divine. It holds significance in many creation stories, representing a liminal space. \n– **Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s Conception**: The statement that Nāmakaokapāoʻo was \"conceived\" (launa kino ai me ka moe 'ana iho) is not simply biological; it signifies his divine origin and destiny intertwined with the land of ‘Ewa.\n\n•  The subsequent actions highlight familial bonds and the nurturing aspect of Pōkaʻī, Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s mother. \n– **Pōkaʻī's Cherishing:** The word \"hāpai\" (to cherish, to favor) reveals a strong maternal bond, indicating that Pōkaʻī held Nāmakaokapāoʻo in high regard from the moment of his conception. This is a common theme in Hawaiian narratives, where mothers play a crucial role in shaping their children’s destinies.\n– **Kauluakaha‘i's Return:**  Kauluakaha‘i returning to his land emphasizes ancestral lineage and the importance of family ties within Hawaiian society. It also provides a sense of grounding and stability to Pōkaʻī and Nāmakaokapāoʻo.\n\n• The final sentence, \"With this birth, Pōkaʻī and her child, Nāmakaokapāoʻo, were very fortunate,\" is an assertion of blessing and destined prosperity. \n– **'Ilihune:**  The term 'ilihune (fortunate, blessed) is significant. It connects the birth of Nāmakaokapāoʻo with a sense of divine favor – implying that his arrival was not accidental but ordained. This foreshadows his future role as a powerful, albeit destructive, force within the Hawaiian narrative. \n– **Cultural Significance:**  The paragraph subtly hints at the importance of lineage and ancestral connection in determining one's fate. The prosperity associated with Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s birth links him to the well-being of his family and community.\"",

When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
