And the sweet potatoes, said Puali'i in his promise, “The head of the marlin is roasted with the sweet potato, and Puali’i eats, then his wife, Pōka'ī, and other things are eaten as well. Therefore, Puali'i went to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for food to eat with the sweet potato.",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:** • This paragraph serves as a crucial link between Nāmakaokapāo'o’s earlier actions and his future role in the narrative. It establishes not only his lasting impact on the land but also foreshadows his relationship with Pōka'ī and Puali'i, deeply intertwined with sustenance and cultural practices. \n\n– **Nāmakaokapāo'o and the Sweet Potatoes:** The enduring presence of the sweet potato patches named after Nāmakaokapāo'o highlights a significant aspect of Hawaiian agricultural history.  The 'uala (sweet potato) was a staple food, particularly important during periods of scarcity or hardship, and its cultivation was deeply connected to mana (spiritual power). Naming the patches after him suggests that he either cultivated them himself or somehow became associated with their bounty – possibly reflecting his ability to transform or control the natural world. The \"long\" description of the sweet potato patches may allude to a particular variety known for its resilience, or perhaps symbolize an abundance of resources linked to Nāmakaokapāo'o’s presence.\n– **Puali'i's Promise and Cultural Practices:** Puali'i's statement about eating roasted marlin with sweet potatoes is significant. The combination of marlin (ʻUla) and 'uala represents a specific meal, likely related to the ʻAi Kapu system.  The `āina (land) provides sustenance, and it must be obtained through proper protocols. \n    – **'Ai Kapu:** This refers to the ancient Hawaiian system of food restrictions and prohibitions designed to maintain balance and harmony within the community and with the gods. Certain foods were reserved for chiefs or priests, certain places were considered sacred and off-limits, and specific rituals had to be performed before consuming particular items. The mention of eating \"other things\" alongside the roasted marlin suggests a broader understanding of appropriate food consumption within the context of Hawaiian traditions—not just the strict prohibitions, but also the allowance for community feasts and sharing.\n    – **Mālama ‘Āina:**  This phrase translates to \"to care for the land.\" The cultivation of sweet potatoes by Nāmakaokapāo'o can be seen as an act of mālama 'āina – a responsibility to nurture and protect the resources provided by the `āina. \n– **Honouliuli and Fishing:** Puali’i going to Honouliuli (dark bay) to fish for food is another key detail. Fish, especially marlin, were highly valued in Hawaiian society.  Fishing was not merely a means of obtaining food but also a spiritual act connected to the ocean gods. The phrase \"food to eat with the sweet potato\" suggests that Puali’i understands these two staples as complementary – providing both sustenance and spiritual nourishment.\n– **Name Etymologies:** \n    - Nāmakaokapāo'o:  This name literally translates to \"the eyes of the pāo'o fish.\" The pāo'o is a type of fish that lives in the reef. It is interesting to note how this name connects him with marine life, and could allude to his ability to navigate both the land and sea realms, or perhaps an association with the ocean’s mysterious depths – and possibly also connected with the creation stories where certain deities are associated with particular creatures.\n    - Puali'i:  Meaning \"descendant of a chief\" (a combination of *pua* - flower/descendant and *ali'i* - chief). This underscores his social status and role within Hawaiian society.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
