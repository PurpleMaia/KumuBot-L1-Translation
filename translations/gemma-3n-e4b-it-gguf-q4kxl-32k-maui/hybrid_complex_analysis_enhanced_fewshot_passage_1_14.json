Until Ama'u and his people of 'Ewa were escaping from Nāmakaokapāo'o's destruction, there were no people left, only Ama'u who died. Then O'ahu embraced Nāmakaokapāo'o, and he then took her to his mother and installed her on the land of O'ahu.",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Ama'u heard, and prepared his outrigger canoes, a hundred and eight of them, and sailed down to 'Ewa to meet Nāmakaokapāo'o. Until Ama'u and his people of 'Ewa were escaping from Nāmakaokapāo'o's destruction, there were no people left, only Ama'u who died. Then O'ahu embraced Nāmakaokapāo'o, and he then took her to his mother and installed her on the land of O'ahu.</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 14:** • This paragraph marks a significant turning point in the narrative, detailing Ama'u’s preparations for confronting Nāmakaokapāo'o and culminating in Nāmakaokapāo'o’s eventual dominion over the island of O'ahu. The sheer number of canoes – \"a hundred and eight\" – highlights the scale of the threat posed by Nāmakaokapāo'o and Ama'u's desperation to confront it. \n– **Ama'u:** (Name meaning debated, potentially related to 'a'u - to be eager, to rush) A figure representing resistance against Nāmakaokapāo'o's destructive force, a protector of humanity facing overwhelming odds. His actions are driven by the desire to save his people from annihilation. \n– **'Ewa:** A region on the leeward side of O'ahu. It served as a refuge for Ama’u and his people fleeing Nāmakaokapāo'o. The name 'Ewa itself is significant, meaning \"leeward\" or \"downwind,\" further emphasizing its role as a place of escape from the destructive force coming from the windward side.\n– **Nāmakaokapāo'o:** As established previously, she represents disruptive forces, potentially linked to volcanic activity, earthquakes, and the general chaotic power of nature that challenges human order and societal structures. Her destruction leaves no survivors except for Ama’u, implying a profound disruption of the existing world order.\n– **O'ahu Embracing Nāmakaokapāo'o:** This is a pivotal moment steeped in symbolic significance. The verb \"embracing\" (*'āpilio*) carries connotations of acceptance and incorporation. It suggests that O'ahu accepts Nāmakaokapāo'o, perhaps signifying the island’s willingness to incorporate the disruptive forces into its own identity rather than outright rejecting them. This could be interpreted as a necessary acknowledgement of the power inherent in nature – a force that cannot be entirely suppressed but must be integrated. \n– The act of installing Nāmakaokapāo'o on the land of O'ahu can be viewed as an allegory for acknowledging and accommodating forces previously resisted or demonized within Hawaiian cosmology. It implies a shift away from rigid, exclusionary practices toward a more holistic view of the natural world and its relationship to humanity. This is particularly relevant in considering the impact of the 'Ai Kapu era, where certain aspects of nature (like the ocean) were restricted due to their perceived power; this paragraph suggests a departure from that approach. \n– The ending emphasizes Nāmakaokapāo’o's dominion over O’ahu, solidifying her position as a powerful figure in Hawaiian mythology and highlighting the enduring impact of disruptive forces on the islands. This narrative element likely reflects an understanding that maintaining balance requires acknowledging even those forces perceived as destructive.]</commentary>\n\n\n\n",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
