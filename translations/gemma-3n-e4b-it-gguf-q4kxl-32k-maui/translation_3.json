  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",

They stood beneath the mast of the warrior who was watching over them, as Kauakahi had departed with the sails. At that time, the large canoes of Keawenuiaumi were raised on the mast of the warrior, the birds were perched, calling out: “Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, only a reed. It is a bad canoe, a reed canoe. It is a canoe that cannot cross the ocean.”</translation>\n\n\n\n"
