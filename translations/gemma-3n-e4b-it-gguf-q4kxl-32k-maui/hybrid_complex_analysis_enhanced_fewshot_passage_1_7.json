All the children then ran and stood at a distance to watch Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nā-makaokapāo'o: \"'Yes! Here is the knife in my hand, it is a tool to cut off your head today, and that head, and then I will roast it with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat it first, and then it will be at peace.\" Nā-makaokapāo'o did not listen to these words of Puali'i, and then Puali'i spoke again, the second time. Puali'i was ready to cut off Nā-makaokapāo'o's head, at that time Nā-makaokapāo'o prayed for Puali'i’s death. Thus, he prayed: \"Only the eyes of my pāo'o are beloved, Be gentle, be steady, Should I eat, should I leave, Should I leave Nākukui'aimakaokalani, That is Nākukui'aimakaokalani, That is my chief husband, Nāmakaokai'a the great chief of Hawai'i, Go now, go only in haste, A man with a spear, The spear with a drum, Still die for Nā-makaokapāo'o.\"",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:** • This paragraph depicts a pivotal moment of confrontation and impending violence. It’s crucial to analyze the specific details within this scene to understand its symbolic weight.\n\n– **The Knife and the Threat of Death**: The introduction of the knife is highly significant. In Hawaiian culture, the knife (*koʻili*) represents power, authority, and often a finality – the severing of ties or lives. Puali’i's explicit declaration of intending to cut off Nā-makaokapāo'o’s head is not merely a threat; it’s a symbolic act aimed at neutralizing Nā-makaokapāo'o’s destructive behavior and restoring order, albeit through violent means.\n\n– **The Sweet Potato as a Symbol**: The sweet potato (*ʻuala*) plays multiple roles here. It represents sustenance, life, and the land itself.  Nā-makaokapāo’o's destruction of the patches is not just an act of vandalism; it’s a desecration of the food source, potentially symbolizing disruption of the natural order or spiritual imbalance. Puali'i’s intention to roast and eat the sweet potato with Nā-makaokapāo’o's head can be interpreted as an attempt to reclaim and repurpose what has been damaged – almost as if he’s attempting to absorb the destructive energy and redirect it toward a more controlled outcome.\n\n– **The Prayer and its Significance:** The prayer recited by Nā-makaokapāo'o is exceptionally revealing. It contains several layers of meaning, echoing ancient Hawaiian beliefs and practices.\n    *   **Nāmakaokai’a**: This refers to Nāmakaokai'a, the great chief of Hawai'i, who may be a reference to Pele, goddess of fire. The phrase could represent the idea that Nā-makaokapāo'o is asking for protection from powerful forces (like Pele).\n    *   **Spear and Drum**:  The references to the spear (*ihe*) and drum (*pahu*) are highly evocative. These were integral parts of Hawaiian ritual, warfare, and communication. The combination suggests a call to action – perhaps invoking ancestral power or divine assistance in his defense. It might represent a plea for intervention from the gods on behalf of Nā-makaokapāo'o.\n    *   **\"Only the eyes...\":** This phrase is particularly striking. The eyes are often considered the windows to the soul, and by specifically mentioning them, Nā-makaokapāo'o may be implying that only his essence or spirit remains worth saving – a desperate plea for continued existence even in a diminished form.\n    *   **“Die for Nā-makaokapāo’o”:** This phrase is also deeply significant because it highlights the importance of protecting oneself and one’s own identity, even if it requires sacrifice or confrontation.\n\n– **Allegorical Interpretation: Restoration vs. Destruction**: The entire scene can be viewed allegorically as a conflict between restoration and destruction. Puali'i represents an attempt to restore order by eliminating what he perceives as a threat – the destructive force embodied by Nā-makaokapāo'o. However, Nā-makaokapāo’o’s prayer suggests a different perspective — a desire for survival, protection, and potentially, a re-evaluation of the existing power dynamics. It questions whether destruction is truly the only path to resolution.  It could also be an allegory about the need to respect the land, as Nā-makaokapāo'o’s destructive actions are linked to disrespecting the sweet potato patches – a vital food source and spiritual resource.\n\n– **Historical Context:** Considering this passage within the broader historical context is important. While not directly referencing the ‘Ai Kapu era (a system of prohibitions relating to sacred foods), it indirectly touches on themes related to sustenance, land ownership, and societal responsibility that were central during that period. The disruption of food sources could be seen as a metaphor for disruptions in social order or spiritual harmony—concerns prevalent within the 'Ai Kapu framework.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
