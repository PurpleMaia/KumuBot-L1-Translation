  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair.",

Before beginning to eat, Pikoiakaalala said: “Listen to all of you, this is my law for eating, as follows: “No salt, no pepper, no fish, no taro, no sweet potato, everything I prepare.” He carved a piece of the pig, one portion of purple poi, one leaf, and money, he carved again, almost all the pig was gone, and all the food from the oven. A man said: “This is food from God.” He got up. The elders replied: “Why are you getting up when eating?” “No, it was delicious.” “Yes, we have heard your law,” said the elders. In this way of eating of Pikoiakaalala, his body became large and good, but the leaves were not leaves.</translation></u>\n\n\n\n"
