How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”",

Isn’t it a mast when you make a cloth and a dock, put it inside the canoe, and it’s not a mast?” “It is a mast. When you remove it and get a sail, put it inside the canoe, and it’s not a sail?” “It is a sail.”</translation></u>\n\n\n\n"
