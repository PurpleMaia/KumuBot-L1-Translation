  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_translation": "Here, let us briefly speak of those two names, they are Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, great chiefs both for Hawai‘i; Nāmakaokalani was a father and Nāmakaokai‘a was a child, but they entered into the time of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "• This paragraph serves as an introductory note, providing context about two significant figures mentioned earlier or to be introduced later in the narrative. It’s a common practice in Hawaiian storytelling to offer such concise familial and societal information at the beginning of a section. \n\n– **Nāmakaokalani:** The name itself is a compound:\n    – *Nāmaka*: \"wave,\" often associated with the ocean and the goddess of the sea, Nāmaka. This suggests a connection to powerful forces and potentially fluidity or change.\n    – *kalani*: \"heaven,\" \"sky,\" or \"chiefly.\" Thus, Nāmakaokalani can be interpreted as “chief of the waves” or \"he who rules over the heavens/sky (like the ocean)\". His status as a father signifies lineage and authority within Hawaiian society.\n\n– **Nāmakaokai‘a:** This name is equally significant:\n    – *Nāmaka*: Again, linking her to the sea and Nāmaka.\n    – *okai‘a*: \"of the ocean.\" Therefore, Nāmakaokai‘a means “of the ocean” or “belonging to the waves.”  Her status as a child establishes her position relative to her father and implies potential for growth or influence in the future narrative.\n\n• The phrase \"ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" (they entered into the time of Nāmakaokapāo‘o) is particularly telling. \n    – *pule*:  This word has multiple meanings, including \"time,\" \"period,\" or “season,” but also carries connotations of sacredness and often refers to a specific era marked by significant events or changes. It can also relate to the time when a particular deity’s influence is strong.\n    – This phrase implies that Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a’s story, or their influence, aligns with or is directly affected by the actions/events associated with Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  Given the context of the broader narrative (as implied in the previous examples), this strongly suggests a connection to themes of disruption, change, and potentially the dismantling of established social structures, like those linked to 'Ai Kapu practices as noted earlier. The “time” that they entered into with Nāmakaokapāo‘o could signify their participation or involvement in his actions – whether supporting, opposing, or being directly impacted by them.\n\n•  The brevity of this paragraph suggests it's a foundational statement setting the stage for a broader narrative arc, highlighting key players and the time frame within which their destinies intertwine. It acts as a brief historical marker before diving into the core story.",

  "reference_translation": "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity."
