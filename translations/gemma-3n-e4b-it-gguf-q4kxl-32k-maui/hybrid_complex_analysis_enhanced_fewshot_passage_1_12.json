They arrived at the plains of Keahumoa, entered the house, and no one was there. They were preparing to leave when Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from the rooftop. They heard the voice, but no body was seen; they asked, \"Where are you calling?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied, \"I am here above.\" Eight people then climbed up – four on the back of the house and four in front – and Nāmakaokapāo'o was found. Nāmakaokapāo'o asked, \"What brings you here?\" They replied, \"We have come to be with Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little child like you, strong and very brave, who killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Ama'u, the chief from Waikīkī, sent four people, all of them tall men, all four of them.

It establishes the context for the next stage in the narrative – their interaction and the revelation of his past actions, specifically the killing of Puali'i. The setting at Keahumoa is significant; it’s likely chosen to be away from Pōka'ī’s home, perhaps signifying a shift in power dynamics or a deliberate move towards confronting the consequences of Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions.\n• The description of the four men as \"tall men\" (kānaka kumamāwalu) is notable. It could be an emphasis on their physical presence and perhaps their perceived authority or strength, suggesting they are a formidable group determined to confront Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o.\n• The fact that the house is empty upon their arrival sets a mysterious tone, hinting at Nāmakaokapāo'o’s isolated existence and possibly his secretive nature. It creates anticipation for his appearance. \n• The calling from the rooftop emphasizes Nāmakaokapāo'o’s otherworldly origin or perhaps a deliberate attempt to control the encounter from a position of power.\n• The group identifies themselves as coming \"to be with\" Nāmakaokapāo'o, indicating a desire for companionship or alliance. They explicitly state that he is like them (\"like you\"), emphasizing shared characteristics – being “a little child,” strong and brave. This points to their perception of him as a peer or someone who understands their experiences.\n• The revelation that they know about Nāmakaokapāo'o’s act of killing Puali’i underscores the importance of this event in the narrative. It immediately establishes him as a figure with a potentially violent past, which could shape how others perceive and interact with him. This is particularly significant because it directly links to the preceding paragraph (Paragraph 11) where Puali'i threatened to kill Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo’o in retribution for destroying his sweet potato patches, thus creating a cyclical relationship of vengeance/retaliation. It suggests that this violent act has had far-reaching consequences and is a central part of Nāmakaokapāo'o's identity. The group’s knowledge implies they are either privy to the truth or have pieced together the events surrounding it, indicating a wider awareness of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo’o’s actions.\n</commentary>\n",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
