  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",

The mother looked at her daughter and replied: “Yes, it is the beloved of the red people, and not the son of the red people.” Pumaia said: “What two are making us immortal?” “No, we are not just dying, you are not the son of the red people.” Pumaia said to his wife: “Let us go; take me with you.” They went from Pukoula and along the cliffs of Pauoa until they reached the waters of Alekoki, then onward to Maemae, thus they traveled, and the vast ocean of the great morning carried them to Nuuanu.</translation></u>"
