  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_translation": "The prayer time was finished, and at that time Puali'i placed a lei on Nāmakaokapāo'o, turning the blossoms towards Puali'i, and spoke something else. Puali'i looked at Nāmakaokapāo'o’s head and said, “I love you, Nāmakaokapāo'o.” Then Nāmakaokapāo'o leaned on Puali'i’s head and went to the sea of Waipouli, a bay on the shore of Honouliuli, and he was, in fact, five miles away.",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 9:** • This paragraph marks a pivotal moment in the developing relationship between Nāmakaokapāo'o and Puali'i. The use of the *lei* is highly significant, moving beyond simple affection to a symbol of connection and intent. – In Hawaiian culture, the lei isn’t merely decorative; it’s a tangible expression of sentiment and often carries specific meanings depending on the materials used. A lei given with intention can solidify a bond or mark a transition in a relationship. • The act of turning the blossoms towards Puali'i emphasizes directedness - focusing affection and attention solely upon him. – This demonstrates a deliberate shift from previous interactions where Nāmakaokapāo’o was driven by impulse or destructive urges, to a more intentional engagement with Puali'i. • Puali’i’s address of “Aloha ‘oe” is not just a greeting; it’s a profound statement of affection and acceptance within the framework of Hawaiian social etiquette. – *Aloha* encompasses love, compassion, greeting, farewell, and much more. To say \"Aloha 'oe\" is to convey a deep level of care and acknowledgement of another's spirit. • Nāmakaokapāo’o leaning on Puali’i’s head suggests vulnerability and reliance. – This physical closeness reinforces the emotional connection forming between them and signifies a willingness to be nurtured and supported by Puali'i. • The detail about the distance (five miles) is likely not incidental. It establishes the geographical separation between Waipouli, where Nāmakaokapāo’o is located, and Honouliuli, from which Puali'i originated. – This could allude to a journey or a bridging of distances, both physical and metaphorical, as their relationship develops. The distance itself might symbolize overcoming obstacles or differences in background. • The passage subtly critiques the 'Ai Kapu (food restriction) system by presenting an unconventional romantic interest between two characters that previously had conflicting desires. This is because during periods of Ai Kapu, people were not allowed to engage in behaviors such as affection and love if it went against traditional customs and rituals.",

  "reference_translation": "When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength."
