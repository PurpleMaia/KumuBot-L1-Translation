  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",

Hina belongs to Kauai, and it was there that Laukiamanuikahiki was obtained. Makiioeoe went from Kuaihelani and obtained Hina on Kauai; they slept together, and Hina gave birth. At that time, Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani and said to Hina: “Behold, I am returning; you remain and give birth to a son, name him after me; and when you give birth to a daughter, name her Laukiamanuikahiki. You have given birth and grown large, and you wished to go and seek me out. These are the signs: a red lei, a kumu (a type of drum), an ahuula (a ceremonial object), a large canoe, a small canoe, a great man, a small man, a red canoe, a red dog, a red bird, what is red, a red man.” Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani, speaking the chants of the nature of the daughter and planting all things for Laukiamanuikahiki, both plants and animals; Laukiamanuikahiki is sacred and common.</translation></u></translation>"
