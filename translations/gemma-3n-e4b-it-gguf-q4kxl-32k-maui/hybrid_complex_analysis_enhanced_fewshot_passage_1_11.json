After his mother was hidden, he returned and they lived in their house at Keahumoa. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house, opened the covering of the back and front, and lay down in the middle, directly on top of the roof.",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

It marks a transition towards a more clandestine phase in Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s journey.\n– **Waipouli (grove/thick vegetation):** Hiding in a grove was a common practice for safety and secrecy, often associated with protection from malevolent forces or unwanted attention. The Waipouli itself may have held sacred significance related to fertility and concealment, further emphasizing the protective nature of this act. \n– **Keahumoa (heap of chickens):** This location is significant; it’s where Pua-li'i established his new life with Pōka'ī, suggesting a desire for a fresh start and perhaps an attempt to distance themselves from previous conflicts or societal expectations. The name itself may carry symbolism related to abundance and prosperity – the chickens being a source of food and sustenance. \n– **The Roof as a Symbolic Position:**  Nāmakaokapāo'o’s climbing onto the roof is not merely a physical action; it carries profound symbolic weight:\n    *   **Elevated Status/Power:** The roof represents the highest point of the dwelling, suggesting an assertion of authority or dominance. He isn't just *in* the house but *on* the house – taking control. \n    *   **Direct Connection to the Divine:** In Hawaiian cosmology, the sky and the roof represent the realm of the gods. This act could be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to connect with the spiritual realm or even usurp divine power—a recurring motif in stories involving Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo’o's rebellious nature. \n    *   **Strategic Observation:**  Being on the roof gives him a vantage point, allowing him to observe and perhaps strategize his next moves. He is positioned as an observer, surveying his surroundings from above.\n– **'A'ohe mau'u o ke kua a me ke alo (opening of the back and front covering):** This act further emphasizes his intentionality in revealing himself. The coverings are removed to facilitate his placement directly on top of the roof – no middle ground, full exposure to the environment. \n– **Directly on top of the Roof:**  This positioning is crucial. It underscores his rejection of conventional social hierarchies and a deliberate claiming of dominance over the household. He's not simply *in* the house; he's taking possession of its most prominent space, effectively declaring himself in charge. This action can be seen as an embodiment of the 'ai kapu era when one must establish their authority for survival.\"\n</commentary>\n\n\n\n",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
