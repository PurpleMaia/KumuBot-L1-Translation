  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o was a very small child, but incredibly strong in his youth; there was no one like him from Hawai'i all the way to Ni'ihau in terms of both small stature and great strength. Kauluakaha'i was his father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in Kahikinu'u. Pōka'ī was his mother. His father was a great chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he was also part god.",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "• **Paragraph 1: Introduction and Establishing Context**\n    – This paragraph serves as a foundational introduction to the main characters and their origins, a common practice in Hawaiian narrative. It establishes not only physical attributes but also social standing and lineage, crucial elements for understanding relationships and plot.\n    – **Nāmakaokapāo'o (keiki 'u'uku loa):** The description emphasizes his contrasting qualities – small stature alongside immense strength. This duality is significant; the seemingly delicate exterior belies a powerful inner nature. His name itself offers clues: ‘Nāmaka’ refers to the eyes of the pāo’o fish, a creature associated with the ocean and often seen as mischievous or elusive. ‘Kapāo’o’ implies a smallness or slenderness. The juxtaposition suggests a being who appears insignificant but possesses hidden power, which is a recurring motif in Hawaiian stories.\n    – **Kauluakaha'i (makua kāne):**  His title as 'makua kāne' (father) immediately positions him as a figure of authority and lineage. His connection to Kahikipapaialewa is important; this place, described as ‘he ‘āina i Kahikinu’u’ (a land in Kahikinu'u), indicates a connection to a remote or perhaps even otherworldly realm.  ‘Kahikinu’u’ could imply a distant or hidden land, possibly a metaphor for a spiritual or ancestral realm.\n    – **Pōka'ī (makuahine):** Identified simply as the mother, her role is established through her relationship to Kauluakaha'i and Nāmakaokapāo'o.  The phrase ‘He ali’i nui kona makua kāne no Kahikipapaialewa, a he ‘ao‘ao akua kekahi ona’ (His father was a great chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he was also part god) highlights the high social status of Pōka'ī's father.  The 'ao'ao akua (divine aspect/part god) is crucial; it suggests a lineage imbued with supernatural power or connection to the gods, influencing his descendants. This divine heritage likely extends to Pōka’ī and Nāmakaokapāo'o, contributing to their exceptional qualities.\n    – The repetition of the possessive pronoun 'a'ohe ona lua ma kēia mau mokupuni mai Hawai‘i ā Ni‘ihau' (there was no one like him from Hawai'i all the way to Ni'ihau) emphasizes Nāmakaokapāo’o’s uniqueness and sets up a narrative expectation of extraordinary feats. The geographical scope—from Hawai’i to Ni’ihau—highlights his legendary status within the Hawaiian islands.",

  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;"
