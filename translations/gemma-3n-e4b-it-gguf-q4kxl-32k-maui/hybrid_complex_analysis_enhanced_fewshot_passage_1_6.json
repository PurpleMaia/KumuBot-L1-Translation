Then Nāmakaokapāo'o went back and lit a fire to broil four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was broiling the vines, his stepfather came back and reached him and asked Nāmakaokapāo'o's mother, Pōka'ī: \"No.\" Puali'i said, \"Yes, his head and eyes as food to go with the sweet potatoes that I'll eat today. So, today I will kill him.\"",

This action can be interpreted as a challenge to resource management, especially in relation to the 'Ai Kapu system (see below). \n– The quantity – forty mounds of leaves – emphasizes the scale of his disruption and highlights the potential impact on the community's food supply.\n\n• **The Significance of the Sweet Potato:**  Sweet potatoes were a vital staple in the Hawaiian diet, and their cultivation was closely tied to societal well-being. The destruction of these patches is therefore not merely an act of vandalism but potentially a symbolic act of defiance or rebellion against existing norms.\n– Cultivation practices often involved specific rituals and respect for the land ('āina). Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions could be viewed as disrespectful, disrupting the balance of nature and impacting future harvests.\n\n• **The Role of Puali'i and Pōka'ī:** The arrival of Puali'i and his interaction with Pōka'ī is pivotal. \n–  Puali'i's willingness to accept Nāmakaokapāo'o’s destructive behavior, even offering a gruesome form of recompense (eating his head and eyes), suggests an understanding or acceptance of the underlying forces driving Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions. This could indicate that Puali'i believes this is a necessary consequence for disrupting the balance. \n– The fact that Pōka'ī answers \"No\" to Puali'i's question before Puali'i offers his solution further suggests her cautiousness and perhaps an awareness of the potential consequences of such actions. She may be hesitant to endorse violence or ritualistic sacrifice, even as a form of retribution.\n– The fact that Puali’i is willing to kill Nāmakaokapāo'o, using the head and eyes to supplement his sweet potato meal, connects this passage to ancient Hawaiian practices.\n\n• **The 'Ai Kapu System (Food Laws):**  This entire scene can be interpreted within the context of the 'Ai Kapu system, a complex set of rules governing who could eat what, when, and where.\n    – The destruction of the sweet potato patches may symbolize a challenge to these established food laws. Perhaps Nāmakaokapāo'o’s actions represent an attempt to dismantle or circumvent the restrictions imposed by 'Ai Kapu. \n    –  The offering of his head and eyes as food, though extreme, could be seen as a ritualistic act attempting to appease or restore balance disrupted by Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions. This is a disturbing inversion of usual rituals involving sacrifice for the gods – it’s an attempt at self-sacrifice connected to eating something considered sacred (the head and eyes).\n    – The reference to “food” as a way to compensate, even through violent means, underscores the fundamental importance of sustenance in Hawaiian culture.\n\n• **Allegorical Interpretation:** This passage can be interpreted allegorically as representing the tension between tradition and change. \n    – Nāmakaokapāo'o could symbolize disruptive forces or revolutionary ideas that challenge established norms and require significant sacrifice to manage or contain.\n    – Puali’i, by accepting the violent solution offered, may represent a clinging to traditional methods of control, even if they are brutal and potentially unsustainable. \n    – The overall scene hints at a struggle for balance between upholding tradition ('Ai Kapu), acknowledging change (Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions), and ensuring community survival.

  "reference_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \\[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;"
