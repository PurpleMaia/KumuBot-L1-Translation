Nāmakaokapāo'o’s body at that time was very small, two feet tall, and his illness was not steady, still unsteady. Until they reached the sweet potato field, then he instructed the children, “Tear up the shoots with all the sweet potato leaves on top, do not let any grow.” But the children were still young, so they only gently handled the sweet potatoes; there was no tearing of the shoots.",
  "gemma-3n-e4b-it-gguf-q4kxl-32k-maui_commentary": "• **Paragraph 5: Introduction to Nāmakaokapāo'o and a depiction of childhood.** This passage provides crucial information about Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s physical state and behavior, setting the stage for his later actions. It highlights his small stature and unsteady health, which are repeatedly emphasized throughout stories, positioning him as an underdog figure who compensates with strength and determination. \n\n– **Name Etymology:** Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o literally translates to \"the eyes of the pāo'o fish.\" The pāo'o is a type of fish known for its vibrant colors and quick movements in the water. This name could be interpreted as an allusion to his sharp vision, perhaps even prophetic insight, or it might reflect his unpredictable nature – like the darting fish. The \"eyes\" also implies keen observation and attentiveness.\n\n– **Number Significance (Thirty-seven children):** The precise number of thirty-seven children is likely symbolic. Numbers in Hawaiian tradition often hold significance beyond their literal value. It may relate to specific ancestral lineages, or represent a cohort of individuals destined for certain roles within the narrative.  Without further context from the larger narrative, this remains open to interpretation but points towards a deliberate and meaningful numerical selection by Puali'i. \n\n• **The Instruction and Children’s Response:** The instruction to tear up the sweet potato shoots is significant. It connects directly with themes of land management and resource control – central to understanding Hawaiian culture. \n\n– **‘Ai Kapu Context:** The emphasis on tearing up the *pu'e* (shoots) and leaves is important in the context of ancient Hawaiian agricultural practices, particularly related to ʻAi Kapu. While this passage doesn’t explicitly mention ‘Ai Kapu, it alludes to the disruption of established patterns.  ʻAi Kapu were strict rules governing food preparation and consumption that often involved specific protocols for cultivating crops like sweet potatoes. Disrupting these systems could be seen as a challenge to the established order or an act of defiance against those who enforced them.\n\n– **The Children's Hesitation:** The children’s gentleness in handling the sweet potatoes, rather than aggressively tearing up the shoots, is noteworthy. This suggests a degree of restraint and perhaps a reluctance to fully embrace the destructive task assigned by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. It hints at internal conflict within the group or a recognition that not all disruption is beneficial.\n\n• **Allegorical Interpretation:**  This passage can be interpreted allegorically as representing a struggle for change and the challenges of implementing new ideas. \n\n– **Nāmakaokapāo'o as Agent of Change:** Nāmakaokapāo'o, despite his small stature and initial weakness, is presented as an agent of disruption—someone who seeks to dismantle existing systems.  The sweet potatoes represent a cultivated resource (perhaps representing tradition or established power structures) that he wants to uproot. \n\n– **The Children’s Representational Role:** The children can be seen as symbolizing the future generation – those who might inherit and implement new ways of doing things. Their reluctance to fully commit to destruction suggests a need for thoughtful, measured change rather than reckless abandonment of the past. This mirrors themes found in narratives that explore the tension between tradition and innovation.\n\n– **The Unsteady Health:** Nāmakaokapāo'o’s unsteady health may represent his internal struggle with this disruptive role, highlighting the difficulty of enacting radical change.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
