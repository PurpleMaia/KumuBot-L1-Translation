  "qwen3-30b-a3b-maui_translation": "\n\n<translation>In the night of the moon, the soul of Pumaia is free to the woman. Indeed, the teacher is to be released. She went to the child and said: \"O, your love for the whole world, you are not the child of the whole world.\" He said: \"What is your name?\" \"Not, only a thing to be taken in the night, I am not the whole world.\" She said to the woman: \"Let's go; take me and speak.\" They went from Pukoula to the house of Pauoa, go and reach the water of Alekoki, then to the place of Maemae, like them in the direction of the great day's sea, they reach Nuuanu.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu."
