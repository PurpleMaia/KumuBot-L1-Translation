  "qwen3-30b-a3b-maui_translation": "\n\n<translation>No longer did Pikoiakaalala go away from the people of the land, and he returned to his wife, and found the pig and the food. Before the meal, Pikoiakaalala said: \"Come all of you, it is my place for eating, for instance: 'No bananas, no coconuts, no taro, no breadfruit, no fish, and all my eating.'\" He ate the pig, a pig, the red poi, a fish, and many, he ate again, the whole pig is gone, and all the food is eaten. Some people said: \"It is the food of God.\" This is here. The people said: \"Is this the place where they eat?\" \"No, it is full of bananas.\" \"Yes, we have eaten your food,\" said the people. In this way, Pikoiakaalala took his life and killed many people and the good, and the place is called the place of the pig.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair."
