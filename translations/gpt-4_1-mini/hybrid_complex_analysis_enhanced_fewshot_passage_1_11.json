Nāmakaokapāo'o then climbed onto the roof ridge of the house, lifted the kapa loincloth from his back and chest, and lay down right atop the ridgepole.",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Then, he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. When the mother disappeared, he returned to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there.

This may reflect wider themes of survival, ancestry, and the interplay of concealment and assertion within the socio-political context of Hawaiian chiefly society.\n\n• Taking into consideration previous paragraphs, this moment likely bridges personal family dynamics with broader cultural symbolism, encompassing Hawaiian practices concerning refuge, protection, and the sacred qualities of both natural and built environments.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
