Regarding the sweet potato, Puali‘i said in his vow, “There is the head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato roasted together, and Puali‘i eats it, then it is free, and his wife Pōka‘ī and the others also eat.” Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat along with the sweet potato.",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "• The passage describes a sustained agricultural practice centered on sweet potato cultivation.\n  – The two long sweet potato gardens symbolize continuity and fertility, suggesting a deep connection to the land ('āina) maintained across generations.\n  – The naming of the patches as Nāmakaokapāo‘o implies cultural or spiritual significance, preserving ancestral knowledge and place identity (Kepā, 2012).\n\n• The figure “Puali‘i” functions allegorically, potentially representing a chiefly person or ancestral figure who mediates between land and sea resources.\n  – The name Puali‘i can be broken down as Pua-li‘i: “flower” (pua) and “chief/child” (ali‘i or li‘i), evoking imagery of a noble or sacred origin.\n  – His vow or declaration involving “the head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato roasted together” connotes a ritual meal or symbolic union of land (uala) and sea (ulua fish), reflecting the Hawaiian concept of fo‘ou or cyclical renewal in sustenance (Kanahele, 1986).\n  – The term “noa” (free) here signals the lifting of kapu or restriction, a critical cultural theme especially in the context of food (Ai Kapu system). This may allegorize a period after the 1819 kapu system abandonment or illustrate a mythic return to freedom of resource use.\n\n• The wife’s name, “Pōka‘ī,” also carries meaning: pō (night/darkness) + ka‘i (to lead or follow), which could suggest a complementary role, perhaps the feminine presence guiding or following natural cycles or social structures.\n  – The mention that both Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī eat, along with “others,” underscores communal sharing, a fundamental principle in Hawaiian society.\n\n• The movement from the land (farming patches) to the sea (Honouliuli fishing) emphasizes the integrated Hawaiian subsistence economy.\n  – Honouliuli itself has significant historical resonance, linked to both ancestral use and, post-contact, the infamous internment camp during World War II, though the narrative likely focuses on pre-contact or early contact histories.\n  – Fishing with sweet potato as an accompaniment highlights the complementary dietary strategies, reflecting the balanced use of multiple natural resources.\n\n• The text’s preservation of place names and specific food practices aligns with Hawaiian oral traditions that encode ecological knowledge and genealogical identity.\n  – The ritual or vow expressed by Puali‘i may be a mnemonic device reinforcing social cohesion and reciprocity with the land and sea.\n  – The passage subtly references the tension and eventual relaxation of kapu restrictions, an important cultural transition just prior to or during early missionary influence circa 1820, indicating layered historical consciousness.\n\nReferences:\nKepā, M.

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
