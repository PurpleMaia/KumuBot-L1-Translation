And the sweet potato was good, Puali'i said in his promised words, \"There is the head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato cooked, and Puali'i will eat, and then it is free to be eaten by his wife, Pōka'ī, and the others. So Puali'i went down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat together with the sweet potato.\"",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**\n\n• This passage continues the narrative situated at the location where the main figures reside and cultivate food, focusing on the cultivation of sweet potatoes (special emphasis on two long patches or māla) which are highlighted as enduring landmarks named Nāmakaokapāo'o, linking the place and person symbolically.\n\n– The phrase \"elua āna mau māla ʻuala lōʻihi e waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā\" emphasizes longevity and continuity: these two ʻuala patches have been maintained over generations and remain recognized by name. Naming the cultivated land after Nāmakaokapāo'o integrates individual identity with place, reflecting a common Hawaiian naming practice that endorses genealogical and land ties.\n\n– The name Nāmakaokapāo'o breaks down as Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o: \n • Nā (the plural definite article, \"the\")\n • maka (eyes)\n • o (of)\n • ka pāo'o (pāo'o: a name with literal meaning partly related to a small fish, pāo'o, but here with poetic resonance also connected with 'head'; the compound name includes multiple layers of meaning suggesting ‘the eyes of the pāo'o’ or metaphorically ‘keen sight’ or ‘far-reaching vision’).  \nThis linkage indicates both the land's and the person’s attributes tied closely with vision, perception, and possibly vigilance. Naming land after a person suggests ancestral stewardship and responsibility for resources.\n\n• Puali'i’s dialogue introduces a formalized meal featuring cooked sweet potato (ʻuala) paired symbolically with the head of the ulua fish (poʻo o ka ʻulua), which holds significant ritual and cultural meaning in Hawaiian tradition.\n\n– Ulua (Caranx ignobilis) was a prized fish, and the fish head holds ceremonial importance. The combination of the ulua’s head with sweet potato can be interpreted as a sacred offering or a symbolic meal, perhaps formalizing Puali'i’s claim or blessing. Puali‘i’s “ōlelo hoʻohiki” (promised or vowed words) confirm this act as solemn and binding.\n\n– The expression “Noa” after Puali‘i’s consumption carries nuanced cultural significance: “noa” in Hawaiian worldviews often means free from kapu (restriction), symbolizing the lifting of a prohibitive state or the blessing that the food is now free to be shared. Thus, by consuming the head of the ulua and sweet potato himself, Puali‘i ritually lifts any kapu on the food, allowing his wife Pōka‘ī and others to partake without restriction.\n\n• This ritualized dining act underscores Hawaiian concepts of ʻai kapu (sacred eating or food restrictions) during the ancient kapu system, where persons of rank, rituals, and food preparation were strictly regulated. Puali‘i’s statement and action suggest an assertion of authority and control over food resources and relational bonds—a custom with real implications in maintaining social and familial order.\n\n• Finally, Puali‘i’s movement \"iho aku i kai o Honouliuli e lawai‘a\" (came down to the sea at Honouliuli to fish) completes the picture of subsistence and resourcefulness rooted in both land and sea—fundamental Hawaiian concepts of mālama ʻāina (caring for the land) and kai (sea). \n\n– Honouliuli (modern day area on the island of Oʻahu) was a real place known for abundant fishing grounds, emphasizing the integration of place and sustenance.\n\n– The phrase “lawaiʻa i iʻa ʻai pū me ka ʻuala” (fish for fish to eat together with the sweet potato) symbolizes the balanced diet combining ocean and land resources, central to Hawaiian foodways. This harmonious gathering indicates cooperation between natural elements and people’s roles.\n\n• Allegorically, the passage signifies continuity and harmony between generations, people and ʻāina, social structure and ritual. The enduring sweet potato gardens named after Nāmakaokapāo'o root the narrative in legacy and genealogy; the ceremonial eating anchors the social bonds through shared ritualized food; the fishing trip links the community to the sea, reaffirming the Hawaiian relation to environment and tradition.\n\nThis paragraph thus deepens the theme of interconnection—between individual, land, sustenance, ritual authority, and social relationships—via place names, foods, and promises, all underscoring the layered worldview of Hawaiian culture.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
