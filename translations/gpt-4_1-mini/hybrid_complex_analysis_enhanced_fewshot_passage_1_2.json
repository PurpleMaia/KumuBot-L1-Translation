  "gpt-4_1-mini_translation": "‘O Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa is the land where the two became physically intimate and through their bedding together, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was conceived. Pōka‘ī was pregnant with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i returned to his land; Pōka‘ī continued living with her pregnancy, and later, she gave birth. During this birth, Pōka‘ī and her child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, were considered very destitute.",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "• This paragraph introduces important contextual information about the conception, pregnancy, and birth of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, with specific references to place, relationships, and social conditions:\n  \n  – **‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa:** The naming of this place serves not only as a geographical location but also as a cultural setting. ‘Ewa is a prominent district on O‘ahu, and ‘Hō‘ae‘ae’ literal meaning is “to shake or to tremble repeatedly” which may connote turbulence or significant change, symbolically mirroring the disruptions in the story. Locating the conception here situates the narrative within a real and meaningful ahupua‘a or land division, emphasizing the importance of land as a place of both physical and genealogical origins.\n\n  – **Launa kino & Moe:** The phrase “launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho” explicitly expresses physical intimacy leading to procreation. In Hawaiian tradition, the act of ‘launa’ indicates a meeting or joining, and when followed by ‘kino’ (body) it connotes sexual relations. ‘Moe’ specifically means to lie down or sleep, emphasizing the act of coupling. The directness reflects the narrative style of genealogies and mo‘olelo (stories) that acknowledge human relationships realistically.\n\n• **Character dynamics and roles:**\n\n  – **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o:** This name carries significant symbolic meaning. Literally, “the eyes of the pāo‘o” (a type of fish). Eyes (‘maka’) often symbolize vision, insight, or a gateway to the soul in Hawaiian thought, while pāo‘o fish may carry further metaphorical or genealogical significance. His conception here ties him intimately to both place and parentage, and his birth in hardship foreshadows possible challenges or transformations to come.\n\n  – **Pō-ka-‘ī:** The mother, whose name can be broken down into ‘Pō’ (night/darkness) + ‘ka‘ī’ (to lead or guide), perhaps signifying a guided darkness or a figure associated with transition. That she hāpai (was pregnant) with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o alone after Kauluakaha‘i’s return to his land highlights a potential social and familial dynamic that may reflect customary practices or narrative motifs surrounding separation, responsibility, or the nature of relationships.\n\n  – **Kauluakaha‘i:** His return “ho‘i” to his ‘āina (land) indicates a departure from the mother and child, which may underscore themes of absence, responsibility, or the tension between personal desires and chiefly duties. This is critical in Hawaiian genealogical narratives where chiefly presence or absence influences status and destiny.\n\n• **Social and cultural implications of hānau (birth) and condition:**\n\n  – The phrase “he ‘ilihune loa” denotes a state of extreme destitution or poverty for Pōka‘ī and her newborn, indicative not merely of material lack but possibly exclusion from chiefly status or community support. ‘Ilihune often refers to a poor or oppressed person and may carry social stigma. This aligns with traditional Hawaiian mo‘olelo where hardship at birth often serves as a catalyst for later deeds or transformation.\n\n  – The hardship surrounding birth and early life often functions allegorically in Hawaiian narratives to foreshadow a hero’s challenging journey or the eventual subversion of initial lowliness to greatness.\n\n• **Contextual and narrative function:**\n\n  – The paragraph serves as a crucial connective tissue between the introduction of characters (Example 1) and the subsequent developments in their relationships and life circumstances (Examples 2 and 3).\n\n  – It reflects a common mechanism in Hawaiian storytelling where geographic specificity anchors genealogical events, underscoring the indigenous worldview that genealogy, land (‘āina), and personhood are inextricably linked.\n\n  – The acknowledgement of poverty at birth also humanizes the main protagonist, making any future accomplishments more dramatic and culturally resonant.\n\n• **Broader cultural-historical perspectives:**\n\n  – This narrative likely resonates with ‘Ai Kapu era contexts, where chiefly lineage (‘ali‘i) and birth circumstances critically determined a person’s social trajectory, yet stories often emphasized that status could be contested or transformed by personal virtues or divine favor.\n\n  – The emphasis on conception at a specific place and subsequent hardship could allegorize tensions between generational transitions, indigenous notions of mana (spiritual power), and sociopolitical realities of land and lineage control.\n\nIn summary, this paragraph uses place, intimate relationship, and social condition to frame Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s origins in a culturally grounded and symbolically potent manner, setting the stage for his role as both a literal and allegorical figure within Hawaiian mo‘olelo tradition.",

  "reference_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",

When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
