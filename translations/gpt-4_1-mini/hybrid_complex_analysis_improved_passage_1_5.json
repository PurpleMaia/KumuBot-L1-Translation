This can be interpreted as a metaphor for the fragile state of Hawaiian traditions post-contact and just prior to the abandonment of the kapu system in 1819.\n\n• Analysis of the name Nāmakaokapāo‘o  \n  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pā-o‘o breaks down as “the eyes (nā maka) of the wall (ka pā) of the sacred enclosure (ʻo‘o).” This may invoke a guardian or overseer figure watching over sacred boundaries—both literally in agriculture and metaphorically in cultural preservation.  \n  – The name may imply a protective yet watchful role, overseeing the children who represent future generations, and the cultivation of sweet potato, a staple dietary and cultural resource, metaphorically linking vigilance to sustenance.\n\n• Symbolism and cultural significance of the sweet potato patch scene  \n  – Sweet potatoes (uala) held significance in Hawaiian culture as staple crops introduced and propagated with care and ritual. The instruction to “pull the bunch with all the leaves” and “leave none growing” could be a metaphor for total commitment or harvesting all potential cultural knowledge, leaving no legacy “growing” unattended.  \n  – The children’s fear and gentle restraint might symbolize the cautious maintenance of traditions under external pressures—reflective of Hawaiian society’s gradual exposure to foreign influences and the subsequent missionary period post-1820, which often discouraged or altered traditional practices.  \n  – The frustrated but gentle harvesting process can be interpreted as social commentary on the tension between innovation and preservation in the Hawaiian worldview, where respect for the land (aloha ‘āina) and the ‘uala symbolizes nurturing yet sustainable use of resources.\n\n• Historical and cultural context  \n  – This narrative operates at the cusp of the post-kapu era (immediately following 1819), where old religious and social orders were being questioned or abandoned. The “sickness” not yet cured may symbolize the lingering effects of cultural dislocation and disease introduced by contact with foreigners—impacting the bodies and spirits of the people.  \n  – The presence of multiple children under the guidance of a weakened elder suggests the liminality of this period—between traditional knowledge and emerging new ideologies, highlighting the challenges of intergenerational knowledge transmission.  \n  – The story may encode a subtle critique of the failure to fully “harvest” or preserve cultural knowledge amidst fear and uncertainty, prompting reflection on the consequences of hesitant cultural stewardship.\n\n• Post-contact influences and narrative tones  \n  – The slightly detached and clinical observation of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s physical condition may reflect Western-influenced biographical or medical perspectives introduced by missionaries and scholars, suggesting a blend of indigenous storytelling with post-contact documentary styles.  \n  – The narrative’s emphasis on obedience (“do not leave any growing”) yet children’s cautiousness introduces a tension that might mirror early Hawaiian communities’ oscillation between adherence to traditional authority and adaptation to new social realities under missionary influence.\n\nIn sum, this passage uses dense symbolic imagery—numerical, bodily, and agricultural—to illustrate a moment of cultural vulnerability and potential renewal in early 19th-century Hawaiian society, emphasizing the delicate balance between preservation and change during a critical historical juncture.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
