  "gpt-4_1-mini_translation": "Puali‘i died, and then Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and they lived together, but Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of all O‘ahu who lived at Waikīkī, was sitting. Someone came from Honouliuli all the way to Waikīkī while the chief was there. He said: “O chief! There is a small but very strong child. His father died, and his head was severed far out in the sea, in a very distant place, five miles distant. ‘Ama‘u heard that the child had strength and said, ‘I will kill him,’ but then he said, ‘I will not kill him; he has no strength.’ When he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words.”",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nPuali‘i died, and then Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and they lived together, but Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of all O‘ahu who lived at Waikīkī, was sitting. Someone came from Honouliuli all the way to Waikīkī while the chief was there. He said: “O chief!

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
