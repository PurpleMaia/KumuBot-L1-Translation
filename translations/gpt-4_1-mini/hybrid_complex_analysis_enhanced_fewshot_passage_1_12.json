  "gpt-4_1-mini_translation": "‘Ama‘u, the chief from Waikīkī, sent four war parties, each consisting of twenty-eight warriors, making a total of one hundred and twelve men among the four groups. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but there was no one there. As they were prepared to leave, Nāmakaokapāo‘o called out from the top of the ridge. They heard the voice, but saw no body, so they asked, “Where are you speaking from?” Nāmakaokapāo‘o replied, “Here I am, above.” Eight men climbed up: four behind the house, four in front, and they found Nāmakaokapāo‘o. He said, “What brings you here to provoke us?” They answered, “We have come to battle Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a small child like you, strong and very fierce, the one who killed his stepfather, Puali‘i.”",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\n‘Ama‘u, the chief from Waikīkī, sent four war parties, each consisting of twenty-eight warriors, making a total of one hundred and twelve men among the four groups. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but there was no one there. As they were prepared to leave, Nāmakaokapāo‘o called out from the top of the ridge. They heard the voice, but saw no body, so they asked, “Where are you speaking from?” Nāmakaokapāo‘o replied, “Here I am, above.” Eight men climbed up: four behind the house, four in front, and they found Nāmakaokapāo‘o. He said, “What brings you here to provoke us?” They answered, “We have come to battle Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a small child like you, strong and very fierce, the one who killed his stepfather, Puali‘i.”\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• This passage introduces a significant escalation in conflict by the sending of multiple war parties:\n  – ‘Ama‘u (meaning \"fern\" or \"to rest\") is identified as the ali‘i (chief) from Waikīkī, a historically prominent district on O‘ahu noted for its political importance and strategic coastal location. The chief’s involvement signals the conflict has entered a higher political sphere with organized warfare.\n  – The detail that four war parties (po‘e kaua) were sent, each with twenty-eight (kanahā kumamāwalu) warriors, for a total of one hundred and twelve men, reflects the typical Hawaiian war organization where numbers are significant and numerically symbolic. The figure twenty-eight could be related to the lunar cycle (28 days), a fundamental time reckoning in Hawaiian culture, possibly implying a complete or cyclical military campaign.\n• The setting at Keahumoa (literally “heap/gathering of chickens”) recalls the earlier domestic scene where Puali‘i settled, indicating this site’s importance as a contested locale between opposing factions; it may metaphorically represent the accumulation of conflict or the confrontation of rival ‘ākea kāne (warriors).\n• The warriors’ entry into the seemingly empty house and readiness to depart only to hear Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s disembodied call evokes supernatural or spectral imagery common in Hawaiian oral tradition:\n  – The phrase “no body seen” and Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s location “above” (i luna) suggest he occupies a place not easily perceived by enemies, possibly alluding to a metaphysical or elevated status, such as a guardian or spirit fighting beyond physical confines.\n  – The division of eight men climbing—four behind and four ahead—signifies tactical military etiquette, encircling enemies from multiple directions, reflecting native war strategies known from material culture and chants.\n• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s role as a small child who exhibits extraordinary strength and is feared by the warriors marks his archetypal status as a youthful hero or demigod figure common in Hawaiian mo‘olelo:\n  – His name, meaning “the eyes of the pāo‘o (pāo‘o is a fish known for its striking eyes),” highlights keen perception and warrior acuity. This is consistent with his ability to communicate from an unseen vantage point.\n  – The description of him as “he ikaika a me ke koa loa” (“strong and very fierce”) underscores supernatural qualities that defy his age and size, a frequent motif symbolizing emerging leadership or divine favor.\n• The mention that he killed his “stepfather,” Puali‘i, introduces a complex familial and political dynamic, recalling the prior paragraphs where Puali‘i proposed a relationship with Pōka‘ī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother:\n  – Puali‘i’s death at the hands of the young hero symbolizes a revolutionary overthrow or rejection of old authority, possibly an allegory reflecting resistance to established ‘Ai Kapu-era power structures.\n  – The label “wahi keiki ‘u‘uku” (“a small child”) juxtaposed with the reputation for strength and conquest invites a thematic contrast between appearance and reality, a common cultural valorization of cunning and mana (spiritual power) over mere size.\n• Broadly, this passage advances the narrative from domestic and relational tensions to open warfare, embedding themes of youthful empowerment, divine intervention, and political upheaval within a traditional Hawaiian worldview centered on familial allegiance and cosmic order.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
