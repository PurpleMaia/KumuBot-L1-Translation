  "gpt-4_1-mini_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o kept pulling up all the sweet potato patches—first from one patch of sweet potatoes above another sweet potato patch. In this way, all two patches were pulled up until the appearance of the leaves of the sweet potatoes stood, about one and one-half (kanahā) times the size of the two patches. Then, Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned and lit a fire, and as the fire burned, the four vines (‘au) of the sweet potato dried up on the fire. While he was burning up on the fire, his paternal uncle Kōlea came and asked his mother, Pōka‘ī: “No?” Puali‘i answered: “Yes, the head and eyes are the ones that cause my sweet potatoes to keep spraying today, so this is the day that he will die for me.”",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "• The figure of Nāmakaokapāo‘o as an agent of transformation  \n  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s act of pulling up all the sweet potato patches metaphorically represents a complete harvesting or perhaps a purging of resources and vitality. Sweet potato (uala) is a staple crop with deep ancestral significance, symbolizing sustenance and life cycles (Beamer 2014).  \n  – The detail that the leaves stand about one and one-half times (kanahā) the size of the two patches may encode a numerical allegory; kanahā (one and a half) often signifies a measure of imbalance or transitional growth in Hawaiian riddling tradition (Malo 1951). This indicates an incomplete or intermediate stage, perhaps reflecting societal upheaval or spiritual transition.\n\n• Symbolism of fire and vines (‘au) in Hawaiian cultural worldview  \n  – Lighting a fire to burn the vines ‘au of the sweet potato signifies a ritual cleansing or ending. Fire in Hawaiian cosmology is both destructive and regenerative (Kamakau 1991), used to cleanse kapu (taboo) or end cycles. The four vines can symbolically represent the four major directions or family lines, indicating an encompassing scope of this transformative act.  \n  – The drying and burning of the ‘au may suggest the demise of a certain lineage or system, potentially referencing the old kapu system’s decline during transitional years around 1819 (Ai Kapu era ending), when resource control and social structures were dramatically altered.\n\n• The paternal uncle Kōlea and the mother Pōka‘ī as narrators and witnesses  \n  – Kōlea means “the dark or black bird,” often associated in Hawaiian lore with watchfulness or messengers from the spiritual realm (Pukui & Elbert 1986). His role as a questioner before Pōka‘ī indicates an inquiry into fate or the spiritual state of affairs.  \n  – Pōka‘ī, whose name can mean “to snatch” or “to grab,” responds with confirmation, stressing the head and eyes as the cause of the sweet potatoes “spraying” (perhaps a metaphor for growth or life force). The interplay suggests that the “head and eyes” (probably leadership or insight) governs abundance or vitality in the land/crops.  \n  – This dialogue encodes a power dynamic and foreshadows death (“this is the day he will die for me”), which can be interpreted allegorically as the death of an old system or authority figure whose control or insight once ensured prosperity.\n\n• Names as layered meanings and allegorical devices  \n  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o: Nā-maka-o-ka-pā-o‘o translates as “The eyes of the hard-fought boundary,” evoking the notion of vigilance over contested or sacred ground. This figure may embody the enforcement or disruption of socio-political boundaries or kapu (taboos).  \n  – Kōlea, as noted, the dark bird, often omen-like or representing spiritual intermediaries, is poised as an observer or harbinger of change.  \n  – Pōka‘ī, meaning “to seize or grasp,” functions as the maternal source of knowledge or tradition, signaling continuity and assertion of karmic or genealogical authority.\n\n• Contextualizing the passage historically and socially  \n  – The pulling up of the patches and burning of vines can be read against the backdrop of early 19th-century Hawaiian society approaching the end of the Ai Kapu era (1819) and the 1819 abolition of the kapu system by Kamehameha II. The narrative reflects tensions between old and new orders, agricultural fertility linked to sacred authority, and the consequences of disruption (Kamakau 1991).  \n  – The interaction between Kōlea and Pōka‘ī may evoke the societal questioning and uncertainty accompanying the abandonment of previous religious and resource management paradigms and the rise of new authority forms following missionary contact (post-1820).  \n  – Numerical and botanical symbolism, combined with character personifications, suggest a layered commentary on loss, renewal, and transformation of power.\n\n• Possible social critique or cautionary element  \n  – The statement “this is the day he will die for me” functions as a prophetic judgment, intimating that the causes (head and eyes—the leaders or seers) of vital productivity (uala growth) face imminent demise, a subtle critique of leadership and its consequences for community sustenance.  \n  – The mythic elements invite reflection on the fragility of human arrangements over natural cycles, warning perhaps against disrespect or mismanagement of resources and the intangible “eyes” (wisdom, oversight) needed to preserve life.\n\nReferences:  \n- Beamer, K.

  "reference_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \\[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;"
