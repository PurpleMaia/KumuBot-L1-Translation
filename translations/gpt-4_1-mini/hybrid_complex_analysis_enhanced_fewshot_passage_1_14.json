When Ama'u and his men arrived in 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o moved swiftly in total destruction; not a single person was left, and Ama'u died. Nāmakaokapāo'o then took control all around O'ahu, and afterward he ascended to his mother and set himself upon the land of O'ahu.",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Nāmakaokapāo'o then took control all around O'ahu, and afterward he ascended to his mother and set himself upon the land of O'ahu.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 14:**\n\n• This paragraph introduces a significant conflict episode involving 'Ama'u, who responds aggressively to Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions by preparing an armed force:\n  \n  – The name ʻAmaʻuʼ may metaphorically represent a figure of strength or wrath; ʻamaʻuʼ can mean “fear” or “to dread,” which could underscore his role as a formidable warrior chief. His leadership in mobilizing ʻumi kumamāwaluʻ (eighteen) war canoes indicates considerable logistical and martial capacity, reflecting typical inter-chiefly warfare in pre-contact Hawai'i where fleets of waʻa kaulua (double-hulled canoes) were deployed for major battles.\n\n  – The specificity of “eighteen” canoes perhaps holds symbolic numerological importance. The number ʻumiʼ (ten) aligned with ʻkūmāwaluʻ (eight) totals eighteen, a composite that can allude to completeness and strength in Hawaiian cosmology, linking military preparedness with ritual or symbolic overtones.\n\n• ʻEwa as the theater of war situates the narrative geographically in a historically significant district of Oʻahu known for its fertility and strategic importance, often contested among chiefs. Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s position here establishes him as an aggressive force reshaping land control:\n\n  – The phrase “noke mai ana ... i ka luku ā pau loa” portrays Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s campaign as thorough and devastating—ʻnokeʻ implying swift or decisive action; ʻlukuʻ meaning destruction or annihilation. This totality of conquest, leaving “ʻaʻohe kanaka koe” (no one left), is a motif common in Hawaiian warfare chants and legends illustrating both physical victory and spiritual cleansing or dominance.\n\n  – Amaʻu’s death in this context symbolizes the failure of the old order or opposing lineage against Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s rising mana (power). The demise of Amaʻu may also signify an allegorical ‘death’ of resistance, ensuring the centrality of Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s mana over ʻEwa and beyond.\n\n• The political/military reach expands: “Puni a'ela ʻOʻahu nei iā Nāmakaokapāoʻo” indicates territorial consolidation over the entire island of Oʻahu. ʻPuniʻ (to surround, encircle) metaphorically suggests complete control and legitimate rule, reflecting the traditional Hawaiian concept of ʻʻāina i ka ponoʻ (land made right through just chiefly governance).\n\n• The ascent to his mother and setting himself upon ʻāina Oʻahu evokes significant cultural symbolism:\n\n  – Climbing or ascending to one’s ʻmakuahineʻ (mother) can be read both literally and metaphorically: literally returning to the nurturing presence or protection of his genealogical source, and metaphorically affirming his authority through maternal lineage, a vital source of chiefly legitimacy in Hawaiian genealogical traditions.\n\n  – The phrase “ho'onoho ihola i luna o ka ʻāina Oʻahu nei” (set himself upon the land of Oʻahu) encapsulates the act of claiming rulership or establishing ʻa piko (a pivotal center of control and authority) over the island. ʻHo'onohoʻ (to establish, place firmly) marks the final assertion of sovereignty and political ascendance.\n\n• In the broader narrative arc, this paragraph reflects the increasing power and expansion of Nāmakaokapāoʻo, consistent with heroic archetypes in Hawaiian moʻolelo where a chiefly protagonist conquers and unifies territories. It also illustrates the dynamics of warfare and political consolidation in pre-contact Hawaiʻi, intertwining genealogical claims, military exploits, and territorial governance.\n\n• Allegorically, the total defeat of Amaʻu and the subsequent occupation of Oʻahu by Nāmakaokapāoʻo may symbolize the triumph of a new socio-political order or ideology, possibly reflecting deeper cosmological or cultural shifts analogous to the transformative themes found earlier in the narrative.\n\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
