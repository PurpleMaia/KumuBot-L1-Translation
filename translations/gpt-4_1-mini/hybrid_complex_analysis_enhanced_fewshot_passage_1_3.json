  "gpt-4_1-mini_translation": "While they were sitting together, Puali‘i, a good man from Līhu‘e who was fishing at the shore of Honouliuli, came down and paid a visit to Pōka‘ī’s house. Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and liked her, and said: “I want you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī replied: “How could you want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is blemished.” Puali‘i answered: “Those things don’t matter. If you like me, let us sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed. Then Pōka‘ī went with her man, Puali‘i, to live at the plains of Keahumoa.",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "• **Introduction of a New Character and Place:**\n  – The passage introduces Puali‘i, described as *he kanaka maika‘i* (“a good man”), emphasizing his positive character traits. His connection to Līhu‘e situates him geographically on Kaua‘i island, a significant detail that subtly anchors the narrative in a real locale.\n  – Puali‘i’s arrival at Honouliuli for fishing shows traditional Hawaiian subsistence activities and suggests interconnectedness between places and people. Honouliuli, often translated as “dark bay,” situates the scene at a coastal fishing site, indicative of everyday life engaging with natural resources.\n\n• **Cultural Practice of Visiting and Courtship:**\n  – Puali‘i’s act of *kipa* (visiting) Pōka‘ī’s home aligns with Hawaiian customs of hospitality and open visitation during the ‘Ai Kapu era and prior, when social visits were common and expected, especially in small communities.\n  – The courtship dialogue demonstrates Hawaiian attitudes toward relationships:\n    * Puali‘i openly expresses his desire (*makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u* “I want you to be my woman”), highlighting straightforward communication in Hawaiian courtship.\n    * Pōka‘ī expresses hesitance due to her perception of being less desirable after childbirth (*ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino* “I have given birth to a child and my body is blemished”). This self-effacing modesty reflects cultural nuances surrounding femininity, fertility, and body image within traditional community expectations.\n    * Puali‘i counters with reassurance that these physical or social conditions are unimportant, emphasizing *ka makemake* (mutual desire) as the foundation for partnership and cohabitation.\n  – Their decision to *e moe kāua* (“let us sleep together”) signals forming a traditional relationship, possibly a steady partnership or marriage-like union, without complicated formalities—a natural and pragmatic approach to relational commitments.\n\n• **Symbolism in Name and Place:**\n  – *Puali‘i* can be analyzed linguistically:\n    * *Pua* (“flower”) often symbolizes beauty, life, or lineage.\n    * *Li‘i* literally means “chief” or reflects high rank.\n    * Together, *Puali‘i* may imply “flower of the chiefs” or a man of chiefly beauty/virtue, aligning well with his depiction as *he kanaka maika‘i*.\n  – *Pōka‘ī*’s name evokes complexities:\n    * *Pō* means “night,” possibly signifying mystery or depth.\n    * *Ka‘ī* can be “to surround” or “to enclose,” suggesting protection or secrecy.\n    * This could reflect her initial reluctance or her role as a protective figure—for herself and her child.\n  – Relocation to *Keahumoa* (“heap of chickens”), a place name, carries symbolic weight. Chickens had ritual and subsistence value; the place might evoke abundance, life, or domestic stability, fitting the new family unit’s establishment.\n\n• **Social Norms and Gender Roles in Historical Context:**\n  – Pōka‘ī’s concern about her body after childbirth reveals sensitive cultural attitudes surrounding fertility and female sexuality. The fact that childbirth does not preclude desire or partnership, however, reflects Hawaiian cultural acceptance of women’s central role in family continuity despite physical changes.\n  – Puali‘i’s acceptance embodies an inclusive kinship model and practical social alliances, which underpin community stability.\n  – Their union and movement to a new home represents both literal and metaphorical growth—a new phase of life following the uncertainties of single motherhood.\n\n• **Narrative Function and Allegorical Implications:**\n  – This episode highlights the merging of life continuities: from single parenthood to partnership, from individual survival to shared household.\n  – Allegorically, Puali‘i may symbolize the restorative force of love and acceptance that heals perceived imperfections, echoing broader Hawaiian values of *pono* (rightness, balance) in relationships.\n  – The setting of a fishing expedition transforming into a visiting and ultimately a romantic encounter suggests the connection between sustenance of the land/sea and sustenance of social life.\n  – This reflects the larger thematic pattern of movement—from isolation to integration, from wilderness to domestication—which is a recurrent motif in Hawaiian narrative traditions.\n\n• **Additional Cultural Notes:**\n  – The straightforward prose and openness in their interaction reflect pre-contact Hawaiian social realities, before European-influenced concepts of courtship altered norms.\n  – The passage implicitly underscores *‘ohana* (family), where new partnerships form organically for collective well-being rather than formal contracts.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
