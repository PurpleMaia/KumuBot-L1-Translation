  "gpt-4_1-mini_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back to his mother, Pōka‘i, and they lived together; Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, was living in Waikīkī. A certain man came from Honouliuli and reached Waikīkī, where the chief resided. He said: “O chief! There is a very strong young child; his father has died, and his head was severed and cast far into the sea, a place very distant, about five miles away. When ‘Ama‘u heard, he said he had strength and could kill him, but he would not do so because the child had no strength.” When he said this in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words.",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nWhen Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back to his mother, Pōka‘i, and they lived together; Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, was living in Waikīkī. A certain man came from Honouliuli and reached Waikīkī, where the chief resided. He said: “O chief! There is a very strong young child; his father has died, and his head was severed and cast far into the sea, a place very distant, about five miles away. When ‘Ama‘u heard, he said he had strength and could kill him, but he would not do so because the child had no strength.” When he said this in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• This passage symbolically depicts a period of mourning and social displacement following the death of a pivotal figure, Puali‘i, whose death triggers a retreat and fasting by Nāmakaokapāo‘o, indicating ritualistic grief and possibly a spiritual purification process.\n  – The refusal to eat (‘a‘ohe ‘ai) by Nāmakaokapāo‘o reflects customary Hawaiian practices of ‘kapu‘ or sacred restrictions during episodes of loss or transition (Kame‘eleihiwa, 1992).\n  – The return to Pōka‘i, the mother, emphasizes the matrilineal grounding in Hawaiian society and the restoration of familial and genealogical ties after disruption.\n\n• The interaction between ‘Ama‘u and the child with a severed head carries allegorical weight tied to the concepts of power, vulnerability, and possibly the suppression or downfall of a rival lineage.\n  – The name ‘Ama‘u can be broken down as A-ma‘u, roughly “the one who desires” or “longs for,” aligning with a chief’s role in seeking to assert dominance.\n  – The severed head symbol (“kiola ‘ia kona po‘o i kai loa”) suggests defeat or death by violence and being cast far at sea metaphorically signals exile or erasure from the community or genealogical memory (Kanahele, 1986).\n  – The stated “five miles” (‘elima mile) might function as a numerical riddle or symbolic distance, often linked with the cosmology of land, sea, and mana boundaries in Hawaiian oral narratives (Beckwith, 1970).\n\n• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s name itself is rich in cultural meaning:\n  – Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o translates roughly as “the eyes of the mountain cloud,” linking the person to natural elements suggesting watchfulness, divine presence, or spiritual omnipresence.\n  – This name positions Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a liminal figure between realms—human, spiritual, and elemental—highlighting his role as witness and participant in socio-political shifts.\n  \n• The setting of Waikīkī and mention of Honouliuli reflect significant historical loci:\n  – Waikīkī as royal residence symbolizes centers of power and customary governance on O‘ahu.\n  – Honouliuli, historically a place of refuge or exile, further intensifies the themes of displacement and conflict.\n  – This passage plausibly references pre- or early-contact social dynamics marked by chiefly rivalry and shifting allegiances during the Ai Kapu era (pre-1819), but the recording of the narrative in post-contact times introduces interpretive layers influenced by Christian missionary critique of indigenous chiefly violence (Kanahele, 1991).\n\n• The dialogue and narrative embed social commentary on strength and legitimacy:\n  – ‘Ama‘u’s refusal to kill the weak child points to Hawaiian values around chiefly authority being contingent on demonstrated strength and legitimacy.\n  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o hearing these words suggests a pivotal moment of awareness that may foreshadow future actions or transformations in status.\n  – The passage may encode historical memories of political upheaval and the enactment of kapu as means of maintaining or contesting chiefly power.\n\nReferences:\n– Beckwith, M.

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
