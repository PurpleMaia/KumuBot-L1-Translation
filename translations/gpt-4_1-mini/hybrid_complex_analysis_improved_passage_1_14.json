  "gpt-4_1-mini_translation": "When ʻAmaʻu heard, he prepared immediately his war canoes, numbering eighteen, and then sailed down to ʻEwa to engage in battle with Nāmakaokapāoʻo. When ʻAmaʻu arrived with his people at ʻEwa, Nāmakaokapāoʻo advanced to complete destruction, leaving no one alive, and ʻAmaʻu perished as well. Nāmakaokapāoʻo then encompassed all of Oʻahu, and after that, she appeared to her mother and firmly established herself as the ruler over the land of Oʻahu.",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nWhen ʻAmaʻu heard, he prepared immediately his war canoes, numbering eighteen, and then sailed down to ʻEwa to engage in battle with Nāmakaokapāoʻo. When ʻAmaʻu arrived with his people at ʻEwa, Nāmakaokapāoʻo advanced to complete destruction, leaving no one alive, and ʻAmaʻu perished as well. Nāmakaokapāoʻo then encompassed all of Oʻahu, and after that, she appeared to her mother and firmly established herself as the ruler over the land of Oʻahu.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• This passage allegorically represents a violent conflict that results in complete conquest, symbolizing the consolidation of power over Oʻahu.\n  – The war leader ʻAmaʻu, commanding eighteen war canoes (a significant number representing completeness or a full force), initiates a traditional ʻaikapu-era style battle (Kamakau 1964), symbolizing chiefly warfare that establishes dominance through martial prowess.\n  – The decisive victory by Nāmakaokapāoʻo and the complete annihilation (\"no one left alive\") could reflect historical narratives of conquest or social upheaval, possibly referencing the tumultuous period around Kamehameha I’s unification efforts or metaphorical cleansing of old order.\n\n• The name “Nāmakaokapāoʻo” breaks down into Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo, meaning “The eyes of the prow (of a canoe).”\n  – “Nā-maka” (the eyes) suggests keen vision or foresight, a common metaphor for leadership and strategic acuity.\n  – “Ka pāoʻo” (the prow) refers to the front of a canoe, a symbol of guided movement and pioneering—metaphorically a leader steering her people.\n  – Thus, Nāmakaokapāoʻo personifies a visionary chief or spiritual force guiding Oʻahu’s fate, embodying the island’s protective and militaristic spirit in lore.\n\n• ʻAmaʻu has connotations of “moss” or “dampness,” something that might symbolically represent stagnation or an older, fading power challenged by the fresh strength of Nāmakaokapāoʻo.\n  – The name suggests a natural element susceptible to being overcome, reinforcing the allegory of old order vanquished by a new emerging force.\n\n• The narrative context aligns with the late pre-contact to early post-contact periods, marked by interisland warfare culminating in unification (circa late 18th to early 19th century).\n  – The scale of conflict using war canoes and total destruction echoes the last vestiges of the ʻaikapu era’s chiefly warfare system prior to 1819, when significant social changes, including the abandonment of the kapu system, occurred.\n  – After conquest, Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s appearance to her mother and installment over Oʻahu may allegorize the legitimization process of new rulership through genealogy and spiritual authority, critical in Hawaiian chiefly tradition (Kamakau 1961).\n\n• The encompassing of all Oʻahu by Nāmakaokapāoʻo points symbolically to unification and stabilization after chaos, a motif found in many Hawaiian moʻolelo reflecting social memory of conquest and political transformation.\n  – This also serves as implicit social commentary: the necessity of strong, strategic leadership (visionary “eyes of the prow”) to bring order, likely reflecting post-contact Hawaiian societal restructuring influenced by missionary and Western governance models.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
