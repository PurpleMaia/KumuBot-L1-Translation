  "gpt-4_1-mini_translation": "‘Ama‘u, the chief from Waikīkī, sent a party of four warriors; among the one group there were twenty-eight men altogether; so it was with all four groups. When they reached the plain of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. As they were ready to leave, Nāmakaokapāo‘o called out from above on the ridge. They heard the voice, but no figure was seen. They asked, “Where are you speaking from?” Nāmakaokapāo‘o replied, “Here I am above.” Eight men climbed up, four from the back of the house, and four from the front, and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Nāmakaokapāo‘o asked, “What is the purpose of your coming?” They answered, “We have come to fight with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a little child like you, strong and a great warrior, who has struck down his father, Puali‘i.”",
  "gpt-4_1-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\n‘Ama‘u, the chief from Waikīkī, sent a party of four warriors; among the one group there were twenty-eight men altogether; so it was with all four groups. When they reached the plain of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. As they were ready to leave, Nāmakaokapāo‘o called out from above on the ridge.

They asked, “Where are you speaking from?” Nāmakaokapāo‘o replied, “Here I am above.” Eight men climbed up, four from the back of the house, and four from the front, and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Nāmakaokapāo‘o asked, “What is the purpose of your coming?” They answered, “We have come to fight with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a little child like you, strong and a great warrior, who has struck down his father, Puali‘i.”\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• The passage allegorically depicts a conflict between established powers and the emergent younger generation or disruptive forces.\n  – ‘Ama‘u, as a chief from Waikīkī, symbolizes traditional ali‘i authority seeking to assert dominance through military means.\n  – The deployment of four groups of twenty-eight men (totaling 112) may represent the full measure of a large-scale mobilization, with the number 28 often linked to lunar cycles, emphasizing completeness or inevitability in Hawaiian numerology. (Malo 1951)\n\n• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s presence “above on the ridge” while unseen suggests a guardian or supernatural figure inhabiting liminal spaces.\n  – Breaking down the name: Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o means “the eyes of the [taro] patches (pāo‘o).” This suggests a watchful, maybe vengeful spirit or deity connected with the land’s sustenance and protection, rather than a mere mortal.\n  – The concealment yet vocal presence echoes Hawaiian beliefs about spirits (aumākua) who can observe and influence without manifesting physically. (Kanahele 1999)\n\n• The narrative references a parricide, with Nāmakaokapāo‘o having killed his father Puali‘i.\n  – Puali‘i’s name: Pua-li‘i can mean “flower of the chiefs” or “chiefly blossom,” insinuating a fallen nobility or prior generation.\n  – The child warrior overthrowing the father can be seen as an allegory for the revolutionary social changes during the late traditional period, such as the waning of old kapu power and the rise of new systems, notably just prior to or around the abolition of the kapu system (Ai Kapu) in 1819.\n  – This reflects internal strife and challenges among Hawaiian ali‘i families in the upheaval caused by religious and political transformations post-contact.\n\n• The setting at Keahumoa, a “plain” or “field of abundance,” and the abandoned house could symbolize the decline or void left by the old regime.\n  – The warriors’ entering an empty house may allude to the dissolution of traditional power centers or spiritual emptiness felt during times of cultural dislocation, such as after 1819 when many temples (heiau) were abandoned under royal edicts influenced by Kū-ka‘ilimoku and Ka‘ahumanu’s policies.\n  – The dual approach of ascending from front and back, each with four men, may point to balanced strategic attack or the integration of opposing forces.\n\n• The passage illustrates typical Hawaiian narrative techniques of riddling imagery and multiple layers of meaning.\n  – The unseen voice, the numerical groupings, and the familial conflict encourage understanding beyond the literal, indicative of traditional oral storytelling that encodes historical memory and social critique.\n  – Given that the narrative possibly emerged post-contact, the tension between old and new values may subtly critique the upheavals wrought by Western arrival and the missionary presence, which repudiated many indigenous practices.\n\nIn sum, this passage uses character archetypes and symbolic actions to comment on a period of intense social and spiritual transformation in Hawaiian history, articulating the struggle between old chiefly orders and emergent forces that redefined Hawaiian society in the early 19th century.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
