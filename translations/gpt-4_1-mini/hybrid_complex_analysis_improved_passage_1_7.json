  "gpt-4_1-mini_translation": "Puali‘i took hold of the short dagger and then went until he reached the middle where Nāmakaokapāo‘o was stabbing the four sweet potato vines, above the fire. All the children saw this and quickly ran and stood at a distant place out of fear of Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: “Hey! Here is the short dagger in my hand; it is the tool to cut off your head today, and then your head will be cooked with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat first, and then you will be free.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not listen to these words of Puali‘i, so Puali‘i spoke a second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut off Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head with the short dagger when at that moment Nāmakaokapāo‘o prayed his death prayer for Puali‘i. It was as follows:  \n“My beloved eye of my sliced-off region,  \nIt is craving, it is trembling,  \nWhether to eat or to leave,  \nLeave it perhaps to Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,  \nThat is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,  \nThis is my beloved friend,  \nNāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i,  \nLet it be slippery, let it be slippery the eel,  \nIt is only people and the spear,  \nThe spear is only with the sheath,  \nNāmakaokapāo‘o will surely die.”",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
