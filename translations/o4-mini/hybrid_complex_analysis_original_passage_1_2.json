  "o4-mini_translation": "The land of Hō‘ae‘ae in ‘Ewa was the place where the two of them lay together, joining in intimacy and sleeping until Nāmakaokapāo‘o was conceived.  Then Pōka‘i carried Nāmakaokapāo‘o in her womb.  Kauluakaha‘i indeed returned to his own land, while Pōka‘i remained throughout her pregnancy and afterward gave birth.  At that birth, both Pōka‘i and her child Nāmakaokapāo‘o were of very low rank.",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "1. Cultural and Historical Context  \n– Hō‘ae‘ae and ‘Ewa: ‘Ewa is one of the ancient moku (districts) on O‘ahu, on the leeward (west) side of the island.  Hō‘ae‘ae designates a subdivision of ‘Ewa, itself a fertile area known for its kula (dryland agriculture) and anchialine ponds.  By locating the birth of Nāmakaokapāo‘o in Hō‘ae‘ae, the text ties this genealogy to a specific landholding, an essential element in Hawaiian chiefly lines.  \n– Genealogical importance: This paragraph is part of a mo‘okū‘auhau (genealogical account) that traces ancestral connections through birth, marriage, and rank.  The low status of both mother and child at this birth reveals how rank could shift dramatically if a chief neglected family obligations.  \n– Concepts of rank: The term ‘ilihune (here rendered “very low rank”) literally means “slave” or “bondservant.”  Rank in traditional Hawai‘i was determined by birth, chiefly favor, and marriage alliances.  A chief’s failure to acknowledge or support offspring could strip both mother and child of high status.\n\n2. Key Hawaiian Terms and Linguistic Features  \n– ‘launa kino’ (“joining of bodies”) and ‘moe’ana’ (“sleeping together”): Both are idiomatic terms for sexual union, more graphic than the euphemistic ‘ho‘omo‘e’.  Their pairing underscores that this was a private, intimate act rather than a formal marriage ceremony.  \n– ‘loa‘a’: “to be obtained; to come into existence; to conceive.”  In genealogical texts, loa‘a often marks the moment a child is conceived or “brought into being” in the mother’s womb.  \n– ‘hāpai’: “to be pregnant; to carry in the womb; to bear.”  Grammatically, hāpai ‘o Pōka‘i iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o uses the actor–object marker iā to show that Pōka‘i is the one who carries (hāpai) the child named Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  \n– ‘noho ihola’: “to remain until it is completed.”  Ihola intensifies noho (“to remain, dwell”), here indicating that Pōka‘i stayed in one place for the full duration of her pregnancy.  \n– Aspect markers: ho‘i akula (‘indeed returned’), ihola (perfective nuance), and ma hope (‘afterward’) are all fine examples of how Hawaiian narrative makes temporal and aspectual relations explicit without separate past/future tense markers.\n\n3. Narrative Structure and Implications  \n– The paragraph follows a tight sequence: place → union → conception → migration → gestation → birth → rank assessment.  This mirrors many genealogical passages, which are less concerned with emotional detail than with locating births in space and rank.  \n– Kauluakaha‘i’s departure (“ho‘i akula…i kona ‘āina”) is crucial.  By returning to his land, he abandons both the pregnant Pōka‘i and the unborn child.  In Hawaiian custom, acknowledgment by the father (through residence, gifts, or ceremony) could uphold a child’s status.  His absence here foreshadows the low rank ascribed at the birth.  \n– The closing sentence explicitly ties the status of mother and child to this event: Ma kēia hānau‘ana, he ‘ilihune loa ‘o Pōka‘i a me kāna keiki ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  Such blunt statements about rank are typical in mo‘okū‘auhau and serve to warn or explain why a given line did not inherit chiefly rights.\n\n4. Broader Significance  \n– Land and lineage: This small episode illustrates the deep connection between genealogy and land tenure in pre-contact Hawai‘i.  A child’s place in the land hierarchy depended not only on noble blood but also on the social recognition and ongoing ties to ancestral territories.  \n– Gender and power: Pōka‘i’s experience shows the vulnerability of women and children when paternal support was withdrawn.  Yet the very recording of this birth preserves Pōka‘i’s link to the genealogy, suggesting that even low-rank lines were valued in the oral-written tradition for their role in the full tapestry of ali‘i (chiefly) descent.  \n– Language preservation: Passages like this, dense with archaic terms and grammatical structures, highlight the importance of careful linguistic analysis when working with chants, genealogies, and mele.  Understanding words such as ‘launa kino,’ ‘hāpai,’ and ‘ilihune’ in context prevents oversimplification and honors the original record-keepers’ precision.",

  "reference_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",

When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
