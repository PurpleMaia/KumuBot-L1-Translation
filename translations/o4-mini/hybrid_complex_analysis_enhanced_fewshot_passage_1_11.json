  "o4-mini_translation": "Then he took his mother and hid her in the cave of Waipouli. After the mother had vanished, she returned to their house at Keahumoa and lived there continuously. Nāmakaokapāoʻo then climbed up onto the ridge of the house, loosened the bundles at his back and at his chest, and stretched out flat right in the very center of the ridgepole.",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nThen he took his mother and hid her in the cave of Waipouli. After the mother had vanished, she returned to their house at Keahumoa and lived there continuously. Nāmakaokapāoʻo then climbed up onto the ridge of the house, loosened the bundles at his back and at his chest, and stretched out flat right in the very center of the ridgepole.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• Narrative Context and Actions  \n  – “lawe akula ia i kona makuahine” (“he took his mother”) reflects a protective or strategic move, carrying her into the cave (anka) of Waipouli on Kauaʻi, a locale historically used as a refuge in times of threat.  \n  – The mother’s disappearance and subsequent return to their dwelling at Keahumoa indicates restoration of normalcy. Keahumoa, meaning “heap of chickens,” situates the family within a named ahupuaʻa in Līhuʻe district.  \n\n• Spatial Symbolism of the Hale  \n  – Nāmakaokapāoʻo ascends to the kaupoku (ridgepole) of the hale, the high point and “piko” (navel) of a house, thought in Hawaiian architecture to connect interior life with the heavens above.  \n  – By positioning himself at the very center of the ridge, he claims symbolic dominion over the ʻohana’s space, much as chiefs might occupy the piko of a heiau.  \n\n• Gesture of Unbinding  \n  – “wehe a‘ela i ka mau‘u o ke kua a me ke alo” (“loosened the bundles at his back and at his chest”) likely refers to untying kapa bundles or malo–pa‘ū bindings. In material culture, mau‘u (bundles of kapa) preserve mana and tapu; removing them can signal a release from ritual restriction.  \n  – Allegorically, this act may represent Nāmakaokapāoʻo shedding inherited kapu constraints—an echo of post–ʻAi Kapu era shifts when Hawaiians began to question rigid protocols.  \n\n• Name Etymology and Allegory  \n  – Nāmaka-o-ka-pāoʻo literally “eyes of the pāoʻo fish,” here evoked by his perch atop the ridge—he becomes the “eyes” surveying all below. The pāoʻo is swift and watchful; so too Nāmakaokapāoʻo watches from the piko of the family domain.  \n  – His exposure on the kaupoku places him between heaven and earth, an intermediary like a demigod. This aligns with earlier notes that his father, Kauluakahaʻi, is half-divine, underscoring the child’s own nexus between human and akua spheres.  \n\n• Broader Cultural Resonances  \n  – Cave-hiding (hūnā) and rooftop surveillance appear in other moʻolelo as tactics of refuge and assertion. The dual movement—concealment in Waipouli, then display on the kaupoku—mirrors rites of passage: withdrawal into the liminal, then emergence empowered.  \n  – The narrative here foreshadows Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s growing prowess and challenge to established orders, just as in earlier paragraphs where he outstrips ʻAi Kapu norms by acting both destructively and autonomously.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
