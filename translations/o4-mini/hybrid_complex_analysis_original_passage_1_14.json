  "o4-mini_translation": "And when Amaʻu heard this, he fully readied his eighteen war canoes and then sailed down to ‘Ewa to battle with Nāmakaokapāo‘o.  When Amaʻu and his people arrived at ‘Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo‘o came rushing in with utterly devastating force—no one was left alive, and Amaʻu himself was completely slain.  Nāmakaokapāo‘o then took control of all of Oʻahu, and thereafter he carried his mother and installed her over the land of Oʻahu.",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Historical–Cultural Context  \n   • War Canoes (waʻa kaua): The reference to “eighteen war canoes” highlights the scale of inter-island warfare. Each canoe could carry dozens of warriors.  \n   • ‘Ewa District: Located on the leeward (western) side of Oʻahu, ‘Ewa was a key political and agricultural center. Controlling it often meant dominating the whole island.  \n   • Matrilineal Authority: By “installing” his mother over Oʻahu, Nāmakaokapāo‘o affirms the high status of chiefly women (aliʻi wahine) in Hawaiian society.  \n     \n2. Linguistic Notes  \n   • ho‘omākaukau ihola: The particle ihola intensifies the verb, signifying that Amaʻu did not merely prepare but readied his canoes completely and decisively.  \n   • noke mai ana: noke conveys a sudden, forceful rushing—apt for describing a surprise or overwhelming strike in battle.  \n   • ‘a‘ohe kanaka koe: a formulaic way to say “there was not a single person remaining,” emphasizing total destruction.  \n   • make ihola: again, ihola intensifies the verb “to die,” underscoring Amaʻu’s utter defeat.  \n     \n3. Narrative Function  \n   This passage serves as the turning point in the saga: the hero Amaʻu meets his defeat, Nāmakaokapāo‘o secures dominion, and the island’s rulership passes smoothly to his mother, cementing both his military prowess and his respect for familial hierarchy.",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
