  "o4-mini_translation": "Puali‘i seized the meat-cleaver and strode forward until he came upon Nāmakaokapāo‘o who was tearing up the four sweet-potato vines over the fire. When all the children saw him, they ran off and stood far away, fearful of Puali‘i. Puali‘i spoke to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey! Here is the cleaver in my hand, the tool to chop off your head today. Your head will then be cooked with the sweet potatoes, and I will eat it first—and afterward you will be released.”  \nNāmakaokapāo‘o paid no heed to Puali‘i’s words, so Puali‘i spoke again a second time. Puali‘i was ready to cut off Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head with the cleaver, and at that moment Nāmakaokapāo‘o began his death-chant prayer for Puali‘i. It ran as follows:\n\n“Beloved indeed are the eyes of my Pāo‘o,  \nSwell up, be held fast—  \nWhether eaten or left alone,  \nWhether left alone Nākukui‘aimakaokalani.  \nThat is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,  \nThis is my brother dear.  \nNāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i.  \nO writhe!

  "o4-mini_commentary": "• Context and Narrative Action  \n  – This paragraph climaxes the violent confrontation first foreshadowed in Paragraph 6, when Puali‘i threatened to eat Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s head and eyes with sweet potatoes (cf. Example 3). Here Puali‘i finally advances with the ko‘ilipi (meat-cleaver), a tool both culinary and sacrificial.  \n  – The children’s flight (“holo akula… no ka maka‘u ia Puali‘i”) illustrates Puali‘i’s dread-inspiring authority. In the ʻAi Kapu era, the fear of violent enforcement underlay many social taboos and punishments.\n\n• Puali‘i’s Proclamation  \n  – “Eia ke ko‘ilipi ma ku‘u lima” is a ritualized announcement of execution, paralleling the “eia” formula seen in Kū‘s heiau protocols (Pukui & Elbert 1986:247).  \n  – The promise to cook (“kālua me ka ‘uala”) and eat the head first signals a perversion of normal eating practices. In ʻAi Kapu culture, human sacrifice to gods was sometimes ritually replaced with ulua fish (Pukui & Elbert 1986:369). Here, Puali‘i insists on actual flesh, upholding archaic sacrificial violence rather than its fish-substitute.  \n  – The final clause “a laila, noa” implies a perverse “release from kapu” by death—only in passing does the word “noa” (common, free from taboo) recall its usual role as the complement to “kapu.”\n\n• Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s Death-Pray (Pule Make)  \n  – Structure: The mele unfolds in two halves. The first summons cosmic and familial guardians (“Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,” “Kukui‘aimakaokalani,” “ku‘u wahi aikāne”) while the second shifts to martial imagery (“ihe,” “pahu”), ending in the stark affirmation of death.  \n  – Name Etymologies and Invocation  \n    * Nākukui‘aimakaokalani (“The light that kindles the heavenly eyes”): likely a divine or apotropaic deity invoked to witness or transform the impending death.  \n    * Kukui‘aimakaokalani: a variant emphasizing the kukui (candlenut) light, itself a symbol of illumination and protection in Hawaiian ritual (Kamakau 1991:78).  \n    * Nāmakaokai‘a (“The eyes of the kai‘a fish”): another facet-name of the youth, here raised to the status of “ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i,” aligning him posthumously with ruling chiefs and suggesting his passage from mortal child to exalted ancestor.  \n  – Poetic Devices  \n    * Repetition: “E hapupu‘u, e hāpāpa‘a”—calls for swelling and firm holding, perhaps a metaphor for the spirit’s anchoring in the cosmos rather than the severed body.  \n    * Parallelism: “‘O kānaka nō me ka ihe / ‘O ka ihe nō me ka pahu” pairs man with weapon and weapon with drum, fusing the roles of warrior, executioner, and ritual performer.  \n    * Imperative Verbs: “E he‘e,” “E hapupu‘u” animate the chant, making it both a plea and a declaration.  \n\n• Cultural and Allegorical Interpretation  \n  – The confrontation allegorizes the clash between a new, progressive order (represented by Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s energetic destruction of the sweet potato patches) and the old ʻAi Kapu regime (embodied by Puali‘i, the enforcer of grotesque sacrificial practices).  \n  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s pule make is not only a personal farewell but a ritual act transforming him into an ancestral spirit (“ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i”), thereby ensuring that the vestiges of ʻAi Kapu—represented by Puali‘i’s cleaver—are sanctified in memory but unable to persist unchecked.  \n  – The invocation of “noa” by Puali‘i and the reversal in Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s prayer point to the ultimate collapse of strict kapu taboos in historical times, anticipating the 1819 abolition of the ʻAi Kapu system under Ka‘ahumanu and Kamehameha II.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
