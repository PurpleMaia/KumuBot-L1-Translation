  "o4-mini_translation": "While Puali‘i was away fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went with seventeen children to Puali‘i’s sweet potato gardens. At that time her body was very small, bearing two pustules and half of another on her breast; her illness had not yet healed, and she remained emaciated. When they reached that sweet potato patch, she said to the children, “Pull up the clumps with their vines, bringing all the sweet potato leaves up; do not leave any that is still growing.” But the children were afraid, so they worked gently on the sweet potatoes and did not pull up the clumps.",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "1. Cultural-Historical Context  \n– Puali‘i here is portrayed as the landowner whose fields (“māla ʻuala”) are being tended. Sweet potatoes (‘uala) were a staple crop in pre-contact Hawai‘i, often cultivated in small terraces and carefully managed.  \n– Nāmakaokapāo‘o is more famously known in Hawaiian mythology as a sea deity and sister of Pele. In this version she appears in a human role, ill and dependent on children in the field. The number seventeen (“he ʻumi kumamāhiku”) employs the traditional Hawaiian counting pattern: “kumu” (ten) plus “māhiku” (seven).  \n– The description of her body—“elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e”—refers to pox-like pustules. This vividly portrays an illness (ma‘i) still active (“ʻa‘ole i pa‘a kona ma‘i”), underscoring how disease could weaken even a chiefly or divine figure.  \n\n2. Linguistic Features  \n– A hala: a temporal marker meaning “when X had gone/past,” here introducing Puali‘i’s absence.  \n– Ia wā … i hele ai: “at that time … went,” with the relative marker i after wā.  \n– Aspect and mood:  \n  • Continuous aspect “e lewalewa ana nō” (“still wasting away”);  \n  • Imperative preceded by the direction “kēnā akula ia,” a colloquial marker akin to “then she said.”  \n  • Negative imperative “mai waiho” uses mai + verb to forbid leaving any shoots behind.  \n– The use of lā‘au (‘uala vines and leaves) in tandem with “pu‘e” (earth clod) reflects a close agricultural lexicon.  \n\n3. Social Dynamics  \n– The children’s fear (“maka‘u nō ua keiki”) likely blends respect for Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s illness and authority. Rather than risking her displeasure, they “kāohi mālie” (restrained themselves gently), revealing how social rank and wellbeing could shape labor practices in a family or communal setting.  \n\n4. Significance  \nThis passage weaves together mythic names, everyday toil, and the reality of sickness. It preserves both genealogical memory (through named figures) and the lived experience of taro or sweet potato cultivation. Linguistically, it showcases Hawaiian’s rich aspectual system and oral-style narration, with vivid imperatives and culturally resonant terms for land division, crops, and illness.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
