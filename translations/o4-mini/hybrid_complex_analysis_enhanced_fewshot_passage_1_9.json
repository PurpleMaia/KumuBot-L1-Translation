  "o4-mini_translation": "Once Nāmakaokapāoʻ o’s prayer was finished, at that very moment Pualiʻi sliced the ko‘ilipi (the throat‐cartilage) at the precise spot on Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s neck so that the sharpened edges of the koʻi (adze‐blade) would face himself.  The head fell away and, from a distance, spoke aloud.  Pualiʻi’s severed head answered Nāmakaokapāoʻo: “Aloha ʻoe, e Nāmakaokapāoʻo.”  Then Nāmakaokapāoʻo seized Pualiʻi’s head and flung it into the waters of Waipouli—a bay on the shore of Honouliuli stretching some five miles in length.",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 9**  \n• Contextual inversion of roles  \n  – Earlier, Pualiʻi had threatened to eat Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s head and eyes as if they were ʻulu-ʻai (sweet potatoes) in an ‘Ai Kapu–style ritual. Here, immediately after Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s pule (prayer), Nāmakaokapāoʻo enacts the fatal blow upon Pualiʻi—turning the predator into prey and reversing the power dynamic.  \n\n• Pule ('Prayer') as spiritual armament  \n  – In traditional Hawaiian narrative, the pule invoked before combat or a decisive action channels the mana of akua. By concluding his pule, Nāmakaokapāoʻo summons divine sanction for what might otherwise appear as vengeance.  \n  – This reflects the persistence of pre‐contact ritual structures: even in a narrative that allegorizes progress and the end of human sacrifice, the framework of prayer and divine permitting remains intact.  \n\n• The act of cutting the ko‘ilipi  \n  – Ko‘ilipi: in Pukui & Elbert (1986:176) “the cartilage or hanging flesh under the jaw.” Severing it at the “luna pono” (exact, fitting spot) underlines Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s extraordinary precision—echoing his earlier feats of strength and skill.  \n  – Ke koʻi (adze‐blade) functions here as both tool and weapon, symbolizing the fine line between creation (clearing taro, carving wood) and destruction (beheading).  \n\n• The speaking severed head  \n  – The head’s ability to speak (“Aloha ʻoe, e Nāmakaokapāoʻo”) is a trope in Hawaiian moʻolelo signifying undiminished mana even after death. It recalls stories of demigods and kapu‐keepers whose power transcends physical destruction.  \n  – The phrase “Aloha ʻoe” may also carry a double entendre—greeting Nāmakaokapāoʻo but intimating farewell, acknowledging the victor’s supreme authority.  \n\n• Casting the head into Waipouli  \n  – Waipouli (“dark/red water”) on the shore of Honouliuli: the place where Pualiʻi once fished and sought alliance with Pōkaʻī. Returning his head to these waters closes the narrative circle, cleansing the land of the transgression he attempted.  \n  – The specified length—ʻelima mile (five miles)—echoes the numeric pattern from earlier paragraphs (2, 4, 40), perhaps alluding to the completeness of Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s triumph. In Hawaiian numerology, five (ʻelima) can symbolize integration of the full cycle of elements (earth, water, fire, wind, spirit).  \n\n• Allegorical interpretation  \n  – Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s decisive act marks the final abandonment of the old ‘Ai Kapu logic of threatening human heads as ritual food. Instead of offering Pualiʻi’s head as a substitute sacrifice, Nāmakaokapāoʻo casts it away—signifying a break with archaic customs and an embrace of a new order.  \n  – The speaking head—once the source of terror—now pays homage to the hero, suggesting that any residual attachment to former sacrificial rites yields to the forward‐looking ethos embodied by Nāmakaokapāoʻo.  \n\n• Name etymologies revisited  \n  – Nāmaka-o-ka-pāo‘o (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o): “the eyes of the pāo‘o [fish],” denoting keen vision and hidden strength. His victory here reinforces the poetic power inherent in his name—seeing through threats and striking with divine precision.  \n  – Puali‘i (Pua-li‘i): “child or descendant of a chief,” representing traditional chiefly authority and privilege. His downfall underscores the narrative’s critique of hereditary or ritual entitlement when divorced from righteous purpose.",

  "reference_translation": "When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength."
