In traditional Hawaiian life, clearing and tending ‘uala patches could be communal work, often with children as helpers under the direction of an elder or a more powerful youth.  \n  – The reference to “nā keiki he ‘umi kumamāhiku” (the seventeen children) situates Nāmakaokapāo‘o among a cohort. The number 17 (he ‘umi kumamāhiku) may carry symbolic weight—linking to lunar cycles (17 half-months) or mythic genealogies—suggesting this is more than casual child’s play.  \n\n• Description of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s Body  \n  – “he kino ‘u‘uku loa, ‘elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e”:  \n    • kapua‘i = “span” (Pukui & Elbert 1986:214), a measure from thumb to little finger when spread; two spans plus a fraction indicates extreme smallness, marking him still very much a child in stature.  \n    • The extra “hapa kona ki‘eki‘e” (a fraction of height) underscores his precocious but still diminutive form.  \n  – “‘a‘ole i pa‘a kona ma‘i, e lewalewa ana nō”: his malady or “disease” (ma‘i) no longer confines him; he is “lewalewa,” floating or free—an idiom for having recovered strength or being unbound.

Here, the order is total destruction.  \n  – This radical command marks Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s agency and precocity.

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
