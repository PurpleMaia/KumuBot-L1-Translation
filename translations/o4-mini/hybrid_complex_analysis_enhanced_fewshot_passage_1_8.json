  "o4-mini_translation": "Here we speak briefly of those two names—namely, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a. They are both great chiefs of Hawai‘i; Nāmakaokalani is the father and Nāmakaokai‘a is the child. Yet they entered into the pule (ritual service/prayer) of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "• Contextual Placement  \n  – This sentence functions as a brief genealogical aside, a common feature in Hawaiian narrative, where the storyteller pauses the flow of the action to name related chiefs and clarify family ties.  \n  – The connector “Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki…” signals a pivot back to lineage before resuming the main narrative about Nāmakaokapāo‘o.\n\n• Name Etymologies and Symbolism  \n  – Nāmakaokalani: literally “Nā-maka o ka-lani” (“the eyes of the heavens/sky”).  \n     • Pukui & Elbert (1986:290) note “lani” connotes celestial or divine status; thus Nāmakaokalani evokes star-like vision or heavenly oversight.  \n     • As a chief’s name, it suggests a ruler whose insight or authority is of cosmic scope.  \n  – Nāmakaokai‘a: literally “Nā-maka o ka-i‘a” (“the eyes of the fish”).  \n     • The term “i‘a” here implies vitality, abundance, or oceanic wealth—qualities a chiefly line might claim.  \n     • It may also allude to the fish eyes used in ritual contexts, reinforcing a maritime dimension in their chiefly identity.\n\n• Social Rank and Familial Roles  \n  – Both figures are called “ali‘i nui” (high chiefs) of Hawai‘i, indicating the highest stratum of nobility in that island polity.  \n  – The specification that Nāmakaokalani is the “makua kāne” (father) and Nāmakaokai‘a the “keiki” (child) reflects the Hawaiian emphasis on immediate parent–child links to establish hereditary rank and succession.\n\n• “Komo i loko o ka pule”—Ritual Subordination  \n  – The phrase “ua komo i loko o ka pule a Nāmakaokapāo‘o” literally means “they went into the pule (prayer/ritual service) of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  \n     • In a heiau context, to “enter the pule” can mean to become priest-participants or to swear fealty under a chief’s religious authority.  \n     • It often implies accepting the kapu system administered by that chief and serving in his sacred rites.  \n  – Here, the once-independent ali‘i nui submit themselves, indicating that even highborn lineages recognize the superior mana or divine mandate of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.\n\n• Allegorical and Cultural Resonances  \n  – This nod to two great chiefs joining Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s pule can be read as an allegory for shifting political–religious power: cosmic (heavenly) and oceanic chiefs yielding to the emergent hero-demigod.  \n  – It parallels larger Hawaiian history in the ‘Ai Kapu era, when various ali‘i invoked new cults or divine patrons to consolidate control.  \n  – The text thus foreshadows Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s ascendancy, setting up the narrative of his own divine service and the transformations he will effect in the social and religious order.",

  "reference_translation": "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity."
