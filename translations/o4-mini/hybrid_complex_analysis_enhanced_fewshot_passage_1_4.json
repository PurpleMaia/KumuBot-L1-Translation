  "o4-mini_translation": "They lived continuously in that place, cultivating food, leaving behind two long sweet potato gardens that remain to this day; those gardens have been called Nāmakaokapāo‘o ever since. And when the sweet potatoes were ready, Puali‘i made his binding declaration, saying, “Here is cooked the head of the ulua with the sweet potato—Puali‘i shall eat first, and then, the kapu is lifted, and my wife Pōka‘ī and the others may eat.” Afterward, Puali‘i went down to the waters of Honouliuli to fish for more food to eat together with the sweet potatoes.",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "• Continuous Settlement and Agriculture  \n  – “Noho ihola i laila, mahi ʻai”: The phrase emphasizes uninterrupted habitation and a self-sustaining economy based on cultivation. In many mo‘olelo, this wording signals that the ʻohana has not migrated but has put down roots in the ahupuaʻa.  \n  – “‘Elua āna mau māla ʻuala lō‘ihi”: The two long patches of ʻuala (‘uala lō‘ihi) suggest both abundance and careful land division. The number two often implies dual principles—perhaps mauka/makai or male/female aspects of fertility.\n\n• Eponymous Place-Naming as Genealogical Claim  \n  – “Ua kapa ʻia ka inoa … ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o”: Assigning the name of the aliʻi (or demi-god child) to the land is a common means of cementing genealogical rights and mana in traditional Hawai‘i. By calling the gardens Nāmakaokapāo‘o “to this day,” the text underscores a living connection between ancestor and ʻāina.\n\n• The ʻAi Kapu Meal Ritual and Ho‘ohiki (Oath)  \n  – “‘Ōlelo ʻo Puali‘i i kāna ʻōlelo hoʻōhiki”: Puali‘i’s statement functions as a ho‘ohiki—a vow that establishes the order of eating and affirms social hierarchy.  \n    • “Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ʻuala”: Cooking the head (po‘o) of the ulua fish alongside sweet potato echoes sacrificial language from the ‘Ai Kapu era. According to Pukui & Elbert (1986:369), ulua were used as a substitute for human sacrifices in heiau rites—a powerful metaphor here.  \n    • “A ‘ai ‘o Puali‘i, a laila, noa, ‘ai kāna wahine, Pōka‘ī a me nā mea ‘ē aʻe”: The sequence—ali‘i eats first, then noa (kapu lifted), then women and commoners—mirrors the strict eating protocols of the ‘Ai Kapu system. Even though the narrative occurs after the abolition of the ‘Ai Kapu, invoking this pattern reinforces Puali‘i’s status as kāne ali‘i and head of the household.\n\n• Symbolic Resonances of Head, Fish, and Sweet Potato  \n  – The “head of the ulua” symbolizes both consumption and regeneration: in ritual contexts, the head stands for the tuber (po‘o) and the eyes for the vine cuttings (maka) used to replant. Coupling with ʻuala thus becomes an allegory for life’s cyclical nature—harvest and renewal.\n\n• Integration of Land (Māla) and Sea (Kai) in Subsistence Economy  \n  – “Iho akula ʻo Puali‘i i kai o Honouliuli e lawaiʻa”: After formalizing the meal with ʻuala and ulua, Puali‘i returns to fish in Honouliuli’s rich waters. This illustrates the classic ahupuaʻa model: mauka cultivation supports makai fishing, ensuring food security and social cohesion.\n\n• Allegorical Layer: Forward-Looking vs. Rückwärts-gewandt  \n  – In earlier paragraphs, Nāmakaokapāo‘o (the boy) embodied progressive abandonment of ‘Ai Kapu strictures, while Puali‘i represented adherence to ritual. Here, the naming of the gardens after the boy—coupled with Puali‘i’s re-enactment of a formal meal—suggests a synthesis: the community retains the structural memory of ritual hierarchy even as it moves beyond literal sacrificial practices.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
