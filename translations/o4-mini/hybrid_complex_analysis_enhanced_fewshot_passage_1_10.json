  "o4-mini_translation": "Then Puali‘i died, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘ī. The two lived in destitution, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o had no food to eat. At that time, ‘Ama‘u, an ali‘i of O‘ahu, was residing at Waikīkī. A man came from Honouliuli to Waikīkī while the ali‘i was there. He said, “O chief! There is one very small yet exceedingly strong boy. His father has died, and his head was cast far out to sea—at a great distance of five miles. When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, ‘He truly has strength, and I will kill him; but if he had no strength, I would not bother.’” As these words were spoken at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o happened to overhear them.",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nThen Puali‘i died, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘ī. The two lived in destitution, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o had no food to eat.

Chiefs displayed such trophies to assert dominance and incite fear.  \n  – The measure “‘elima mile” highlights the extraordinary nature of this act—a statement of ‘Ama‘u’s military reach and the boy’s tragic lineage.\n\n• Allegorical and Thematic Analysis  \n  – The paradox of small stature vs. immense strength is a common hero-initiation motif (cf. Maui, Kamapua‘a). It foreshadows Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s overcoming of physical limitations through god-given power.  \n  – ‘Ama‘u’s conditional threat—“If he is strong, I will kill him; if not, I will not bother”—reveals a cultural valuation of mana (personal/spiritual power). To kill a weakling is dishonorable; to kill a powerful foe is a testament to one’s own status.  \n  – Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s overhearing of the ali‘i’s words enacts the meaning of his name (maka = eye/seeing, listening), signaling that he is already entwined in the political struggle and that his path to heroism is divinely sanctioned.  \n  – The episode dramatizes the tension between old order (represented by ‘Ama‘u’s warlike kapu practices) and the emerging hero who will challenge and reshape the sociopolitical landscape of O‘ahu.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
