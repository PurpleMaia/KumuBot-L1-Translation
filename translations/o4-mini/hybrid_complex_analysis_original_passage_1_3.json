  "o4-mini_translation": "While the two of them were living together, down came Puali‘i—an excellent man from Līhu‘e, who had been fishing offshore at Honouliuli—and he visited at Pōka‘ī’s house.  Puali‘i gazed upon Pōka‘ī and found her desirable, and said: “I want you to be my wife.”  Pōka‘ī replied: “How can you desire me?  I have borne a child, and my body is no longer attractive.”  Puali‘i answered her: “Those things mean nothing; if you wish me, let us lie together.”  Pōka‘ī agreed.  And so Pōka‘ī returned with her husband and with Puali‘i to the plain of Keahumoa, where they dwelt.",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "1. Cultural Context  \n   - This passage illustrates flexible marital and sexual mores in traditional Hawaiian society, where a woman—though already married—may accept the advances of another man of good reputation (“he kanaka maika‘i no Līhu‘e”) without social stigma.  The fact that Pōka‘ī returns to live with both her husband and Puali‘i suggests a form of consensual polygyny/concubinage rather than strict monogamy.  \n   - Childbearing and postpartum norms appear in Pōka‘ī’s objection—“Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ‘ino‘ino ko‘u kino.”  She is concerned her body, having borne a child, is “ʻinoʻino” (rough, unattractive, or disagreeable).  This remark highlights cultural attention to physical condition in the context of sexual desirability and reproductive status.  \n   - Place-names anchor the narrative in real geography: Līhu‘e (on Kaua‘i), Honouliuli (a coastal area on O‘ahu), and the plain (kula) of Keahumoa.  Puali‘i’s journey “iho maila” (down thither) from Līhu‘e to Honouliuli and then inland to Keahumoa signals the ease of inter-district and even inter-island travel by canoe in pre-contact times.\n\n2. Linguistic Features  \n   - Aspect and directionals: “e noho ana” (imperfective continuous “while they were living”), “iho maila” (directional “down hither”), “kipa maila” (visitative with recent past nuance). The particle “maila” situates the action relative to the speaker’s vantage.  \n   - Direct speech and reporting: The construction “‘ōlelo akula ia: ‘Makemake au iā ‘oe…’” uses the perfective “–akula” to mark completed action, and the third-person pronoun “ia” to introduce quoted words.  \n   - Emphatic possessives: “na‘u” in “wahine na‘u” (“my wife”) intensifies Puali‘i’s claim.  \n   - Negation and minimization: “He mea ‘ole ia mau mea” (“Those things are nothing”) employs “‘ole” to dismiss concerns.  \n   - Coordination: “A ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘i me kāna kāne me Puali‘i” strings together three actors (Pōka‘i, her husband, and Puali‘i) with “me … me …” marking accompaniment.\n\n3. Historical Significance  \n   - The episode reflects how chiefly lines maintained alliances through marriage across districts; Puali‘i’s origin in Līhu‘e and Pōka‘ī’s residence on O‘ahu imply political and genealogical connectivity.  \n   - The mo‘olelo (traditional narrative) preserves not only genealogy but also social practices—sexual freedom for high-ranking women and the regime of hospitality and honor afforded to a “man of good standing” who visits a chief’s household.  \n   - By showing Pōka‘ī negotiating her desirability and consenting on her own terms, the text underscores the agency accorded to Hawaiian women of status in personal and political alliances.  \n   - Finally, the vivid use of place-names and everyday language (“lawai‘a,” “hale,” “kula”) provides scholars today with snapshots of land use (fishing grounds, residential compounds, agricultural plains) in pre-colonial Hawai‘i.\n\nTogether, these linguistic and cultural layers offer a window into the norms of intimacy, inheritance, and inter-district relations that shaped Hawaiian chiefly societies prior to Western contact.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
