  "o4-mini_translation": "The land of Hō‘ae‘ae in ʻEwa was the place where the two became united in the flesh, and in that sleeping together Nāmakaokapāoʻo was conceived. Pōkaʻī then carried Nāmakaokapāoʻo; Kauluakahaʻi returned to his own land; Pōkaʻī remained alone with her pregnancy and afterward gave birth. At that birth, Pōkaʻī and her child Nāmakaokapāoʻo were deeply dishonored.",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "Paragraph 2:\n• Locative framing and its resonance  \n  – “‘O Hō‘ae‘ae ma ʻEwa ka ʻāina” follows the classical Hawaiian narrative formula of naming the precise ‘āina (land) where events unfold.  \n  – Hō‘ae‘ae (“to break the riffles”) on the reef flats of ‘Ewa suggests a liminal zone between land and sea, symbolically rich for themes of conception and transformation.  \n\n• Intimacy outside formal kapu structures  \n  – “launa kino ai me ka moe ʻana iho” employs two related terms for sexual union: “launa kino” (physical intimacy) and “moe ʻana iho” (lying together), underlining the consensual but unsanctioned nature of their union.  \n  – During the ‘Ai Kapu era (pre-1819), sexual relations among ali‘i required strict observance of ritual protocols; here, the absence of formal ceremony foreshadows social repercussions.  \n\n• Conception and the language of obtaining life  \n  – The passive phrase “ā loa‘a ‘o Nāmakaokapāoʻo” (“by that means was Nāmakaokapāoʻo obtained”) is a common poetic construction for conception, aligning the event with other mythic origins.  \n  – “Hāpai ‘o Pōka‘ī iā Nāmakaokapāoʻo” highlights Pōka‘ī’s sole burden of gestation, distancing Kauluakaha‘i from the maternal sphere and signaling her vulnerability.  \n\n• Gender roles, displacement, and isolation  \n  – Kauluakaha‘i’s departure—“ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i i kona ʻāina”—inverts typical ali‘i marriage patterns, in which women customarily moved to their husband’s estate. His return home leaves Pōka‘ī “noho ihola” (to remain alive, literally), emphasizing both her physical endurance and social solitude.  \n  – This separation underscores the precarious status of women whose unions fall outside kapu-sanctioned alliances, leaving mother and child exposed.  \n\n• The birth event and “‘ilihune loa”  \n  – “Ma kēia hānau ʻana” marks the climactic moment of parturition, a time especially fraught with kapu concerning maternal and infant purity.  \n  – The term “‘ilihune loa” conveys profound dishonor or ignoble status—“loa” intensifying “‘ilihune” (low-born, despised). In the ‘Ai Kapu context, a child born outside a properly sanctioned union could be stigmatized, and the mother’s rank diminished.  \n\n• Allegorical dimensions  \n  – On one level, this passage dramatizes the social consequences of breaching sexual and ritual kapu: the very lifegiver and her offspring are cast into shame.  \n  – Symbolically, the disgrace foreshadows the impending collapse of the ‘Ai Kapu system—just as Pōka‘ī and Nāmakaokapāoʻo must struggle against inherited dishonor, Hawaiian society itself is on the brink of transcending rigid taboos and embracing a new order.",

  "reference_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 2:**• Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
