Puali‘i looked at Pōka‘ī and desired her, saying, “I want you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī replied, “How can you want me? I have borne a child, and my body is blemished.” Puali‘i answered, “Those things mean nothing.

She believes her māhū (postpartum state) renders her unfit for union.  \n  – Puali‘i’s retort—“He mea ‘ole ia mau mea”—rejects those kapu restrictions. Allegorically, this anticipates the abolition of the ‘Ai Kapu (1819) when Liholiho (Kamehameha II) declared the ‘Ai Noa, freeing women’s bodies from those ancient prohibitions.\n\n• Establishment of conjugal status:\n  – Pōka‘ī consents and goes “me kāna kāne”—using kāne as husband/long-term partner, formalizing their relationship in Hawaiian terms rather than Western notions of marriage.  \n  – The couple relocates to Ke-ahu­moa (“heap of fowl” or “pile of chickens”):  \n    · Place-name symbolism: chickens (moa) connote fertility and abundance, suggesting that their union will renew the ‘aina’s productivity and seed new lineages.  \n    · Geographical mobility here reflects social mobility and re-formation of kinship ties across districts.\n\n• Allegorical and cultural significance:\n  – Puali‘i’s acceptance of Pōka‘ī despite her child mirrors the integration of blended families and the Hawaiian ideal of extended ‘ohana, transcending older kapu that once isolated postpartum women.  \n  – This passage, set against the backdrop of ‘Ai Kapu customs, functions as an early narrative signal of imminent social change: the dismantling of rigid purity laws and the inauguration of a more inclusive social order.  \n  – The movement from Honouliuli to Keahumoa charts a personal journey that reflects the larger transformation in Hawaiian society—from strict ritual prohibitions to a renewed aloha ‘āina where people of all states are embraced equally.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
