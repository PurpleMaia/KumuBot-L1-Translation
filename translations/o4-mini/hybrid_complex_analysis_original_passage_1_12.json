  "o4-mini_translation": "Therefore Ama‘u dispatched the chief from Waikīkī with four war parties; in each party were twenty-eight men, making a total of four groups. When they arrived on the plain of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. As they turned to leave, Nāmakaokapāo‘o called out from the heights. They heard the voice but saw no form, so they asked, “Where are you speaking from?” Nāmakaokapāo‘o replied, “Here I am up above.” Eight men then climbed up—four on the back of the house and four on the front—until they found Nāmakaokapāo‘o. She said, “What insolence brings you here?” They answered, “We have come to wage war against Nāmakaokapāo‘o—a mere insignificant child like you, yet strong and very brave, the one who slew her own father, Puali‘i.”",
  "o4-mini_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

It illustrates traditional Hawaiian military organization—four war parties of twenty-eight men—and the motif of encountering an unseen, divine adversary whose voice precedes her appearance. The exchange of insults underscores the warrior ethos and emphasizes Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s formidable reputation for having slain her father, Puali‘i. Linguistic features such as ho‘ouna “to dispatch,” kula “plain,” and ‘one‘i “insult” reflect the classical narrative style of Hawaiian akahikī (legends).\n",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
