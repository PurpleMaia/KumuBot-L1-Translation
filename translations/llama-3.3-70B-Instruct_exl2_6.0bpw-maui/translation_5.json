  "llama-3.3_translation": "<translation>\nTwo servants were talking, heard the voices, and woke up to listen, and they understood the words of the owl. One said to the other: \"Perhaps this is the daughter of the chief, Laukiamanuikahiki.\" Another said: \"No, it's not her; her canoe is red, her paddle is red, her oar is red, her people are red, she has big canoes, small canoes, long canoes, tall people, short people, that's how she travels, and this is not the humble daughter.\" They listened again to the words of the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki. \"Let's not speak to the chief, this must be the daughter.\" One agreed. \"Yes.\" They arrived before Chief Makiioeoe, in the evening, and called out: \"Here we are, wake up.\" \"What is it?\" asked Makiioeoe. \"There's an owl perched on top of the bundle where the daughter is.

After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter. They arrived at the home of Makiioeoe after midnight and roused him up saying: “Say, you wake up.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “There is an owl right over the pig house where the girl is held who called out to the girl in the following way:"
