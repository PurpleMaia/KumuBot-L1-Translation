This could be seen as a way of subtlely critiquing the 'Ai Kapu system, which was known for its rigidity and emphasis on social hierarchy.\n• The use of the name Hō-'ae'ae as the location of the conception may hold allegorical meaning, as 'ae'ae can also refer to a type of spiritual border or decoration. This could symbolize the blurring of spiritual and physical boundaries, and the connection between the earthly and divine realms.\n• The birth of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o in 'Ewa, a region on the island of O'ahu, may also hold significance, as 'Ewa is known for its fertile land and abundant resources. This could represent the idea of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o being a symbol of growth, abundance, and new life, which could be fitting for a story that may be allegorically related to the transition away from the 'Ai Kapu era and towards a more progressive time.",
