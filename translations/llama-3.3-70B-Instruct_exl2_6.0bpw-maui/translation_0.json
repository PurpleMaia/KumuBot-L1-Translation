  "llama-3.3_translation": "<translation>According to this story, it is said that Kana's body was very long, a very large and awesome body to look at. During his lifetime, his body was as long as the distance from the uplands to the sea, and his house, Halauoloolo, was also as long; from the mountain to the sea, his body was as long as the distance, and that is how long the house, Halauoloolo, was.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo."
