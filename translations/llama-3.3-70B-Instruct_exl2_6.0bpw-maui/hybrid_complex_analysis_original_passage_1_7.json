All the children saw and ran to gather around, standing in a higher spot to gaze at Puali‘i. Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Here is the adhesive in my hand, which will put an end to your haughtiness today, and then, I will cook with taro, and eat first, and then, it will be free.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not heed Puali‘i's words, and Puali‘i spoke again, with anger. Puali‘i was prepared to put the adhesive on Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time when Nāmakaokapāo‘o was chanting her death prayer for Puali‘i. The prayer went like this: \nMy love is only for the shadowy valleys, \nA withered thing, a shriveled thing is coming, \nPerhaps eaten, perhaps left behind, \nPerhaps left behind is Nākukui‘aimakaokalani, \nThat is Kukui‘aimakaokalani, \nMy spouse is this one, \nNāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i, \nGo, go, only the embryo, \nA human with a spear, \nA spear with a bell, \nDeath to Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "This passage offers a glimpse into the rich cultural, historical, and linguistic heritage of Hawaii. The narrative unfolds with Puali‘i confronting Nāmakaokapāo‘o, showcasing the complex dynamics of Hawaiian society, particularly in terms of power, respect, and the role of spiritual practices. \n\nLinguistically, the passage is replete with examples of Hawaiian language structures and vocabulary. The use of phrases like \"Lālau akula ‘o Puali‘i\" demonstrates the typical Hawaiian sentence structure, where the topic (Puali‘i) is followed by the verb (lālau), indicating an action or state of being. The inclusion of spiritual chants, such as Nāmakaokapāo‘o's death prayer, highlights the significance of oral traditions and ritual language in Hawaiian culture. These chants often employed metaphorical language, such as \"Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o,\" which translates to \"My love is only for the shadowy valleys,\" symbolizing the speaker's longing for a place of peace and tranquility, possibly in the afterlife or a spiritual realm.\n\nCulturally, the passage touches on themes of respect, power, and the consequences of pride or haughtiness (as exemplified by Nāmakaokapāo‘o). The figure of Puali‘i, ready to use the adhesive (ko‘ilipi) as a form of revenge or to assert dominance, underscores the complex societal hierarchies and the importance of maintaining balance and harmony within the community. The mention of cooking taro and eating first also points to the significance of food and communal dining in Hawaiian culture, where sharing meals was not just about sustenance but also about social bonding and status.\n\nHistorically, this narrative likely reflects the societal values and challenges of pre-contact Hawaii, where spiritual leaders, ali‘i (chiefs), and the common people navigated a complex web of relationships, obligations, and spiritual beliefs. The reference to Nāmakaokai‘a as the \"great chief of Hawai‘i\" places the story within a specific historical context, possibly alluding to the period before the unification of the islands under a single ruler, highlighting the political and social dynamics of the time.\n\nIn conclusion, the passage provides a multifaceted view of Hawaiian culture, language, and history, weaving together themes of spirituality, social hierarchy, and the intricate relationships between individuals and their environment. It serves as a window into a rich and complex society, where spiritual beliefs, communal practices, and individual actions were deeply intertwined.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
