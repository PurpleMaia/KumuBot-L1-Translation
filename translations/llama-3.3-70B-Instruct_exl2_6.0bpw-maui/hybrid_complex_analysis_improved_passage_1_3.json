Puali‘i saw Pōka‘ī and desired her, saying: \"I desire you as my wife.\" Pōka‘ī replied: \"Why do you desire me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is tired.\" Puali‘i said: \"Those things are nothing, if you desire me, we will sleep together.\" Pōka‘ī agreed. And Pōka‘ī returned with her husband and Puali‘i to the plain of Keahumoa, and they stayed.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "• The narrative presents an encounter between Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī that can be interpreted as a clash between traditional Hawaiian values and the emerging influence of post-contact social norms.\n  – The fact that Puali‘i, a man from Līhu‘e, expresses his desire for Pōka‘ī despite her recent childbirth and physical condition may symbolize the disruptions to traditional Hawaiian social structures and values following the 1819 abandonment of the 'Ai Kapu system.\n  – This interaction might also reflect the changing attitudes towards women's roles and bodily autonomy in the early 19th century, as influenced by missionary teachings (c.f., Kahakauwila, 2014).\n\n• An analysis of the characters' names provides insight into their symbolic roles within the narrative.\n  – Puali‘i can be broken down into Pua-li‘i, where \"pua\" means flower or offspring, and \"li‘i\" signifies royalty or chiefly status. This etymology suggests that Puali‘i represents a figure of nobility or a symbol of traditional Hawaiian leadership.\n  – Pōka‘ī, on the other hand, can be understood as Pō-ka-‘ī, with \"pō\" referring to the night or darkness, and \"ka\" being a definite article, and \"‘ī\" signifying a22small or insignificant thing. This could imply that Pōka‘ī embodies the mysterious or the unknown, potentially representing the complexities of feminine power and agency in traditional Hawaiian society.\n\n• The setting of the narrative in the area of Honouliuli and Keahumoa provides historical and cultural context.\n  – Honouliuli, a region known for its fishing grounds, may symbolize a space of abundance and fertility, contrasting with the challenges and hardships faced by the characters.\n  – Keahumoa, as a geographical location, might represent a transitional or liminal space, given its association with the plains and the movement of people between different areas (c.f., Kirch, 2010).\n  – The mention of these locations could also allude to the post-contact period's impact on traditional Hawaiian territorial divisions and the reorganization of land use, reflecting broader themes of social change and cultural resilience.\n\n• The narrative's focus on desire, marriage, and childbirth can be seen as a reflection of social commentary on the changing values and norms of the time.\n  – The conversation between Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī might critique the objectification of women's bodies and the disregard for their autonomy in the face of patriarchal desires, echoing the sentiments of scholars like Lilikalā Kame‘eleihiwa (1999).\n  – Furthermore, the ease with which Puali‘i dismisses Pōka‘ī's concerns about her recent childbirth may symbolize the disrespect for traditional Hawaiian practices and values, such as the Kapu o ka ‘Īlonā, which emphasized the importance of postpartum care and separation (Handy & Pukui, 1958).",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
