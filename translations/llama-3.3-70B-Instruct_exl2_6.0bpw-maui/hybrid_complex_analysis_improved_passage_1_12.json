They arrived at the plain of Keahumoa, entered the house, but found no one. As they were preparing to leave, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from above. They heard the voice but didn't see the body, and asked: \"Where are you speaking from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied: \"I am up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four at the back of the house and four at the front, and found Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o asked: \"What brings you here?\" They replied: \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a small child like you, strong and brave, who killed his own father, Puali'i.\"",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The story involves a confrontation between a group of warriors and a mysterious figure, Nāmakaokapāo'o, which may symbolize the clash between traditional Hawaiian beliefs and the incoming foreign influences.</commentary>\n\n• The character of Nāmakaokapāo'o can be interpreted allegorically as a representation of the resilience and adaptability of Hawaiian culture in the face of external challenges.\n  – The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its components: Nā- (the) + maka (eye) + o (of) + ka (the) + pāo'o (shell), which may symbolize the ability to see and navigate through changing circumstances, much like a navigator uses the stars and shells to guide their canoe (Malloch, 2015).\n  – The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o is described as a small child who has killed his own father, Puali'i, may represent the cyclical nature of time and the eventual overthrow of traditional authority figures, as seen in the historical period of the 'Ai Kapu era and its subsequent abandonment in 1819 (Kame'eleihiwa, 1992).\n\n• The number of warriors, four, and the duplication of this number in the climbing men, eight, may hold numerical symbolism.\n  – In Hawaiian culture, the number four is associated with the four directions (akua, alo, kahakai, and ma uka) and may represent balance and completeness (Handy, 1972).\n  – The repetition of the number four in the climbing men may emphasize the idea of mirrored or balanced forces, as well as the idea that the confrontation between the warriors and Nāmakaokapāo'o is a struggle between equal and opposing forces.\n\n• The historical context of this narrative is likely influenced by the post-1820 missionary period, during which traditional Hawaiian stories were written down and possibly modified to conform to Western narrative structures and moral frameworks.\n  – The portrayal of Nāmakaokapāo'o as a strong and brave child who has killed his own father may reflect the influence of Western notions of morality and the nuclear family, rather than traditional Hawaiian concepts of ohana and familial relationships (Silva, 2004).\n  – The narrative may also be seen as a form of social commentary, critiquing the breakdown of traditional authority and the introduction of new, foreign values that challenged the existing social order (Osorio, 2002).\n\n• The character of Ama'u, the chief from Waikīkī, may represent the traditional Hawaiian ali'i class and their role in maintaining social order and balance.\n  – The fact that Ama'u arrives with four equally skilled warriors may symbolize the idea of collective leadership and the importance of cooperation in maintaining social harmony (M Cook, 2011).\n  – The contrast between Ama'u's group and Nāmakaokapāo'o, who is described as a solitary figure, may represent the tension between collective and individual authority, as well as the challenges posed by external influences to traditional Hawaiian societal structures.",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
