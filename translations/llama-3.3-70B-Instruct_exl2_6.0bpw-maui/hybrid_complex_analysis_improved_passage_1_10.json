  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_translation": "The death of Puali‘i, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to her mother, Pōka‘ī, and they lived together, but Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat the food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu, living in Waikīkī, when a man from Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was residing. He said: “Oh chief! There's a small, very strong child, whose father died and whose head was chopped off and thrown into the sea, a very deep place, five miles deep. ‘Ama‘u listened, and he was strong and died because of it, but if he hadn't died, he wouldn't have been strong. While speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
