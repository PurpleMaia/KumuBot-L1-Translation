When the sweet potatoes were cooked, Puali'i uttered his habitual phrase, \"The head of the ulua fish is cooked with the sweet potatoes, and Puali'i eats, then it is permissible, his wife Pōka'ī and others eat as well.\" Therefore, Puali'i went to the sea of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with the sweet potatoes.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "• The passage begins by describing Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's continued presence in a location, likely a farm or a residential area, where he is engaged in farming activities (mahī 'ai) to produce food. The term 'elua āna mau māla 'uala lō'ihi refers to two large sweet potato patches that have been preserved until the present day (ā hiki i kēia lā). The name of these patches is said to be Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, which suggests a connection between the protagonist's name and the sweet potato patches.\n– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its constituent parts: Nā- (the) + maka (eyes) + o (of) + ka (the) + pāo'o (a type of fish, possibly a reference to the ulua fish). This etymological analysis may indicate a symbolic connection between the protagonist, the sweet potato patches, and the ulua fish, which is a significant food source in Hawaiian culture.\n• Puali'i's habitual phrase, \"Aia ā kālua ke po'o o ka ulua me ka 'uala,\" suggests a cultural practice where the head of the ulua fish is cooked with sweet potatoes, making it permissible for others to eat as well. This phrase may be related to the 'Ai Kapu era, where certain foods were restricted to specific individuals or groups.\n– The 'Ai Kapu system, which was in place from around the 12th to the 18th centuries, imposed strict rules on food consumption, including the types of food that could be eaten by different social classes and the rituals surrounding food preparation and consumption. Puali'i's phrase may be an example of how this system influenced everyday life and food culture in ancient Hawaii.\n• The passage also highlights the importance of fishing as a means of supplementing the food supply, as Puali'i goes to the sea of Honouliuli to catch fish to eat with the sweet potatoes. This emphasizes the significance of the ocean as a source of food and the interconnectedness of farming and fishing activities in Hawaiian culture.\n– The mention of Honouliuli, a location on the island of Oahu, provides a geographical context for the story and may suggest that the events are taking place in a specific region or community. This could be relevant for understanding the cultural and historical context of the narrative.\n• Allegorically, the passage may be interpreted as a representation of the balance between farming and fishing activities, as well as the importance of ritual and cultural practices in Hawaiian society. The connection between Nāmakaokapāo'o, the sweet potato patches, and the ulua fish may symbolize the interconnectedness of human life, agriculture, and the natural environment.\n– The use of the ulua fish as a symbol may also represent the idea of abundance and fertility, as the ulua fish was considered a sacred animal in Hawaiian culture. The cooking of the ulua fish with sweet potatoes could represent the union of different food sources and the celebration of the abundance of the natural world.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
