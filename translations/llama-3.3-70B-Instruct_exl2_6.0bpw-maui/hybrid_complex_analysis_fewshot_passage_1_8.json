This could symbolize a higher level of understanding or a strong spiritual foundation, characteristic of high chiefs during the 'Ai Kapu era who often claimed divine ancestry.\n– Nā-maka-o-kai-‘a breaks down into: ka-i-‘a (of the sea or related to the sea), which might represent a connection to the ocean, fertility, or the provision of food, as the sea was a primary source of sustenance in ancient Hawaiian society.\n• The inclusion of these characters in the prayer of Nā-makaokapāo‘o suggests a broader narrative scope that may involve themes of lineage, spiritual power, and the balance between celestial and earthly (or spiritual and physical) domains.\n– The fact that Nāmakaokalani is the father and Nāmakaokai‘a is the child may allegorically represent the passing down of knowledge, power, or spiritual insight from one generation to the next, a crucial aspect of Hawaiian cultural and religious practices.\n– The mention of these high chiefs and their relationship to Nāmakaokapāo‘o's prayer could also allude to the complexities of the 'Ai Kapu system, where social hierarchy, religious practices, and familial lineage were intricately connected. The narrative may be setting the stage for exploring these themes in the context of progressive thinking versus traditional 'Ai Kapu customs, similar to the interpretations surrounding Nāmakaokapāo‘o's actions and character in previous paragraphs.",

  "reference_translation": "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity."
