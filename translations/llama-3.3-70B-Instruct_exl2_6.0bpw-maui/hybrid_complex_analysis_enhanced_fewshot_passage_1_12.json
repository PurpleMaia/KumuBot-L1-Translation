The use of the term \"kanahā kumamāwalu kānaka\" to describe the tall and strong man suggests a sense of impressive physical stature, which is reiterated for all four warriors. This emphasis on physical strength and bravery is reminiscent of the 'Ai Kapu era, where warriors were highly valued for their strength and martial prowess.\n– The name Waikīkī is derived from the words \"wai\" (water) and \"kīkī\" (multitude), suggesting a place of abundant water or a gathering place. This etymology may be significant in the context of the story, as it could represent a connection to the natural world and the importance of water in Hawaiian culture.\n• The warriors arrive at the plains of Keahumoa, where they enter a house but find no one. This could be seen as a symbol of the emptiness or desolation of the traditional Hawaiian way of life, which was being disrupted by the introduction of new customs and practices.\n– The fact that the warriors are about to leave when Nāmakaokapāo'o calls out from the rafters suggests a sense of hidden presence or unexpected surprise. This could be seen as a metaphor for the way in which traditional Hawaiian knowledge and practices were often hidden or suppressed during the 'Ai Kapu era.\n• Nāmakaokapāo'o's question, \"He aha mai nei kā 'oukou o 'one'i?\" (\"What brings you here?\"), is a typical Hawaiian greeting, which is often used to inquire about the purpose or intention of a visitor. The response from the warriors, \"I hele mai nei mākou e kaua me Nāmakaokapāo'o,\" (\"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o\"), suggests a sense of confrontation and conflict, which is a common theme in Hawaiian mythology and legend.\n– The reference to Nāmakaokapāo'o as a \"keiki 'u'uku\" (small child) who is \"ikaika a me ke koa loa\" (strong and very brave) is significant, as it suggests that Nāmakaokapāo'o is being seen as a symbol of traditional Hawaiian values and strengths. The fact that he is also accused of killing his stepfather, Puali'i, adds a sense of complexity and nuance to the story, and raises questions about the nature of justice and morality in Hawaiian culture.\n• The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its component parts: Nā- (the) maka (eyes) o (of) ka (the) pāo'o (a type of fish). This name may be allegorical, suggesting a connection to the natural world and the importance of vision and perception in Hawaiian culture. The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o is being sought out by the warriors could be seen as a metaphor for the way in which traditional Hawaiian knowledge and practices were being targeted and suppressed during the 'Ai Kapu era.",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
