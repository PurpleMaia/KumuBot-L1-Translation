At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, was residing in Waikīkī, where he lived. A certain man from Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was residing, and said: “Oh chief! There is a strong and powerful little child, whose father has died and whose head was cast into the deep ocean, a very long distance, five miles. If ‘Ama‘u had heard of this and came to me, I would have died at his hands, but since I did not die, he has no power over me.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words being spoken in Waikīkī.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Puali‘i died, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and they sat together, but Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat any food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, was residing in Waikīkī, where he lived. A certain man from Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was residing, and said: “Oh chief!

If ‘Ama‘u had heard of this and came to me, I would have died at his hands, but since I did not die, he has no power over me.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these words being spoken in Waikīkī.</translation>\n\n<commentary>This paragraph marks a shift in the narrative, as Nāmakaokapāo‘o returns to his mother Pōka‘ī after Puali‘i's death, and the attention turns to ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, and a conversation that takes place in Waikīkī.</commentary>\n\n• The passage begins with the death of Puali‘i, which serves as a catalyst for Nāmakaokapāo‘o's return to his mother Pōka‘ī - **Pō-ka-‘ī** (night falls upon the high chief). The fact that Nāmakaokapāo‘o does not eat any food suggests that he may be in a state of mourning or that he is not interested in worldly pleasures at this time.\n• The introduction of ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, residing in Waikīkī, adds a new layer to the narrative. **‘A-ma‘u** (to withstand or endure) is likely a name that reflects the chief's ability to maintain power and authority.\n• The conversation between the man from Honouliuli and ‘Ama‘u is significant, as it highlights the theme of power and strength. The man mentions a little child who is strong and powerful, with a father who has died, and a head cast into the deep ocean. This image may be an allegory for the transformative power of the ocean and the cycle of life and death.\n– The use of the word **lō‘ihi** (deep) to describe the ocean is notable, as it emphasizes the idea of depth and profundity. The measurement of five miles (**‘elima mile**) adds a sense of specificity and wonder to the narrative.\n– The man's statement that if ‘Ama‘u had heard of this and came to him, he would have died at his hands, suggests a fear of the chief's power and authority. However, the fact that he did not die implies that ‘Ama‘u's power is not absolute, and that there may be others who possess equal or greater strength.\n• The fact that Nāmakaokapāo‘o hears these words being spoken in Waikīkī is significant, as it suggests that he is aware of the conversations and events that are taking place around him. This may be an indication of his growing power and awareness, as he navigates the complex web of relationships and alliances in the community.\n– In the context of the 'Ai Kapu era, this passage may be seen as a commentary on the nature of power and authority. The character of ‘Ama‘u, as a chief, represents the traditional authority structures of the time, while Nāmakaokapāo‘o, with his unusual strength and abilities, may represent a challenge to these established power dynamics.\n– The use of the ocean as a symbol of transformation and power is also noteworthy, as it reflects the importance of the sea in Hawaiian culture and spirituality. The image of the head cast into the deep ocean may be seen as a metaphor for the journey of the soul, and the cycle of life and death that is central to Hawaiian belief systems.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
