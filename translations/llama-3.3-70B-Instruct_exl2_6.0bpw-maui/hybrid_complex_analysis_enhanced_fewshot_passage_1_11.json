Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Nāmakaokapāo'o's mother was then taken to Waipouli cave to hide. The mother hid, and then returned to their house in Keahumoa to live. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the rafters of the house, separated the thatch of the roof and the crossbeams, and slept in the middle on top of the rafters.</translation>\n\n<commentary>This paragraph describes the actions of Nāmakaokapāo'o and his mother, Pōka'ī, as they attempt to evade detection and find a place to live in secrecy. The narrative context is one of hiding and seeking refuge, which is a common theme in Hawaiian storytelling.</commentary>\n\n• The location of Waipouli cave is significant, as it is a place of hiding and refuge for Pōka'ī. The name Waipouli can be broken down into its component parts: Wai-pou-li, with \"wai\" meaning water or liquid, \"pou\" meaning night or darkness, and \"li\" meaning to climb or ascend. This may suggest that Waipouli cave is a place of spiritual or mystical significance, where one can climb or ascend to a higher level of understanding or consciousness.\n– The fact that Pōka'ī is taken to Waipouli cave to hide implies that she is being protected or concealed from something or someone. In the context of the 'Ai Kapu era, this could suggest that Pōka'ī is being hidden from the authorities or from those who would seek to do her harm.\n• Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions in climbing up onto the rafters of the house and separating the thatch of the roof and the crossbeams may be seen as a symbolic attempt to transcend or rise above the constraints of his physical environment. The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its component parts: Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, with \"nā\" meaning the, \"maka\" meaning eyes, \"o\" meaning of, \"ka\" meaning the, and \"pāo'o\" meaning a type of fish. This may suggest that Nāmakaokapāo'o is someone who is able to see or perceive things from a unique or elevated perspective.\n– The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o sleeps in the middle on top of the rafters may imply that he is seeking a sense of balance or equilibrium in his life. In Hawaiian culture, the concept of balance and harmony is closely tied to the idea of mau loa, or the continuous and unbroken flow of life. By sleeping on top of the rafters, Nāmakaokapāo'o may be attempting to connect with this flow and find a sense of peace and tranquility.\n• The image of Nāmakaokapāo'o sleeping on top of the rafters may also be seen as an allegory for the tension between the old and the new, or between traditional and modern ways of thinking. In this sense, Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions may be seen as a symbol of the desire to break free from the constraints of the past and forge a new path forward.\n– This interpretation is grounded in the historical context of the 'Ai Kapu era, during which time there was a significant shift in the cultural and social practices of the Hawaiian people. The 'Ai Kapu system, which was based on a complex set of rules and regulations governing the behavior of men and women, was eventually abolished, and a new era of cultural and social change began. Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions in this paragraph may be seen as a reflection of this larger cultural shift, as he seeks to navigate the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
