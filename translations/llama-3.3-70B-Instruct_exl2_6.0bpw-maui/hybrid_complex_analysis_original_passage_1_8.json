  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_translation": "Now, let us speak briefly of those two names, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, they were great chiefs of Hawai‘i, Nāmakaokalani was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the child, but they were both included in the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "The given Hawaiian passage provides a glimpse into the rich genealogical and spiritual heritage of Hawaiian culture. The text mentions two significant figures, Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, who are identified as great chiefs (ali‘i nui) of Hawai‘i. The relationship between these two individuals is clarified as parent and child, with Nāmakaokalani being the father and Nāmakaokai‘a being the child. \n\nLinguistically, this passage showcases the complexity and depth of the Hawaiian language. The use of the phrase \"Ma ‘ane‘i e ‘ōlelo iki\" as an introductory statement indicates a shift in the narrative, signaling that the speaker is about to delve into a new topic or provide additional information. The employment of possessive pronouns and suffixes, such as \"‘o ia ‘o\" to indicate the subjects and their relationship, demonstrates the language's capacity for nuanced expression of kinship and genealogy.\n\nThe mention of these chiefs being included \"in the prayer of Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" hints at the spiritual and ritual significance of these figures within Hawaiian culture. In Hawaiian tradition, prayers and chants often invoked the names of ancestors and deities to seek blessings, protection, or guidance. The inclusion of Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a in such a prayer suggests their importance as ancestral figures, whose spirits could influence the lives of their descendants and the community.\n\nHistorically, understanding the context of this passage requires knowledge of Hawaiian genealogy and the roles that ali‘i (chiefs) played in Hawaiian society. Ali‘i were not only political leaders but also spiritual guides, responsible for maintaining the balance and well-being of their people and the land through their connection with the divine. The fact that Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a are referenced as great chiefs underscores their influence and stature within their community.\n\nMoreover, the passage highlights the importance of genealogy (mo‘okū‘auhau) in Hawaiian culture, where knowing one's ancestors and their stories is crucial for understanding one's identity, role in society, and connection to the land and the gods. The relationship between Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, as well as their inclusion in a prayer, illustrates the intricate web of familial, spiritual, and political relationships that defined Hawaiian society.\n\nIn conclusion, this Hawaiian passage offers a window into the complex cultural, linguistic, and historical dynamics of ancient Hawai‘i. It underscores the significance of genealogy, the role of ali‘i, and the spiritual practices that were integral to Hawaiian life, providing valuable insights into the beliefs, values, and traditions of the Hawaiian people.",

  "reference_translation": "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity."
