  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"I know, Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great person, and I have gone to Ko'olau, and I am his namesake.\" They said: \"No, it's you, that's what we've heard, so you will die by our hands, you will not live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Let's go down and struggle.\" When they went down, Nāmakaokapāo'o began to kill, until all were dead, except for one person who escaped and went to Waikīkī, found 'Ama'u, and told him about the death of all the others, and 'Ama'u was upset upon hearing the news.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"I know, Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great person, and I have gone to Ko'olau, and I am his namesake.\" They said: \"No, it's you, that's what we've heard, so you will die by our hands, you will not live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Let's go down and struggle.\" When they went down, Nāmakaokapāo'o began to kill, until all were dead, except for one person who escaped and went to Waikīkī, found 'Ama'u, and told him about the death of all the others, and 'Ama'u was upset upon hearing the news.</translation>\n\n<commentary>This narrative appears to be set in a pre-contact or early contact period, given the lack of explicit references to foreign influences. However, the themes of power, identity, and mortality may reflect the social upheavals of the late 18th or early 19th centuries, such as the 'Ai Kapu era or the 1819 abandonment of traditional practices.</commentary>\n\n• The character of Nāmakaokapāo'o represents a complex figure of power and identity, as evidenced by his claim to be a namesake of a great person.\n  – The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its constituent parts: Nā- (the possessive article), maka (eye or face), o (of), ka (the article), and pāo'o (tough or strong), suggesting a connection to vision, strength, or fierce determination.\n  – This character's actions and dialogue may symbolize the assertion of authority and the negotiation of identity in a pre-contact Hawaiian context, reflecting the cultural values of mana (power) and aloha (compassion).\n\n• The event of Nāmakaokapāo'o killing all but one of his opponents can be seen as an allegory for the struggles of Hawaiian society during times of transition and upheaval.\n  – The number of survivors (one) may hold symbolic significance, potentially representing the idea of a sole survivor or a new beginning, as seen in other Hawaiian narratives (e.g., the story of 'Aukelenuiaiku).\n  – This narrative may also reflect the impact of post-contact diseases, which decimated Hawaiian populations, leaving only a few survivors in some areas, as noted by historians like Patrick Kirch (2010).\n\n• The historical context of this narrative may be connected to the 'Ai Kapu era, a period of strict social hierarchy and ritual regulation in pre-contact Hawaii.\n  – The mention of Ko'olau, a region on the island of O'ahu, may indicate a specific geographical and cultural context for the story, as Ko'olau was known for its rich agricultural lands and strategic importance.\n  – The story's themes of power, identity, and mortality may be seen as a commentary on the social commentary of the time, reflecting the tensions between tradition and innovation, as well as the impact of external influences on Hawaiian society, as discussed by scholars like Lilikalā Kame'eleihiwa (1992).\n\n• The character of 'Ama'u, who is informed about the death of Nāmakaokapāo'o's opponents, may represent a figure of authority or a symbol of the broader Hawaiian community.\n  – The name 'Ama'u can be broken down into 'A- (a prefix indicating a place or location) and ma'u (to gather or collect), potentially suggesting a connection to gathering, unity, or collective action.\n  – 'Ama'u's reaction to the news may symbolize the emotional and social impact of violence and conflict on Hawaiian communities, highlighting the importance of aloha (compassion) and ho'oponopono (reconciliation) in maintaining social harmony, as emphasized by Hawaiian cultural experts like Mary Kawena Pukui (1983).",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
