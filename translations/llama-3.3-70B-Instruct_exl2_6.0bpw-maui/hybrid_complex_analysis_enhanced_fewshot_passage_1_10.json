At that time, 'Ama'u, a chief of O'ahu, was living in Waikīkī, and a man from Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was living. He said, \"Oh, chief! There's a strong little child whose father has died and whose head has been cast into the deep sea, a very long distance, five miles. 'Ama'u heard this and thought that if he were strong, he would kill him, but if he weren't strong, he wouldn't kill him.\" As he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o heard these words.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Puali'i died, and Nāmakaokapāo'o went back to his mother, Pōka'ī, and they lived there, but Nāmakaokapāo'o did not eat. At that time, 'Ama'u, a chief of O'ahu, was living in Waikīkī, and a man from Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was living. He said, \"Oh, chief!

'Ama'u heard this and thought that if he were strong, he would kill him, but if he weren't strong, he wouldn't kill him.\" As he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o heard these words.</translation>\n\n<commentary>The narrative context of this passage revolves around the introduction of a new character, 'Ama'u, and the spreading of news about Nāmakaokapāo'o's exceptional strength and his father's demise.</commentary>\n\n• The passage begins with the death of Pua-li'i, Nāmakaokapāo'o's stepfather, and Nāmakaokapāo'o's return to his mother, Pō-ka-'ī. This marks a significant shift in Nāmakaokapāo'o's life, as he is now without a male figure in his household.\n– The name Pua-li'i can be broken down into Pua-(a)li'i, with \"pua\" meaning \"child\" or \"descendant\" and \"ali'i\" referring to a chief or ruler. This etymology suggests that Pua-li'i is a member of a chiefly line, which may have implications for Nāmakaokapāo'o's own social status.\n• The introduction of 'Ama'u, a chief of O'ahu, adds a new layer to the narrative. 'Ama'u is described as living in Waikīkī, which was an important location during the 'Ai Kapu era due to its abundant resources and strategic position.\n– The name 'Ama'u can be analyzed as 'A-ma'u, with \"a\" being a prefix indicating a place or location, and \"ma'u\" meaning \"to gather\" or \"to assemble\". This etymology may suggest that 'Ama'u is a gatherer or unifier of people, which could be relevant to his role as a chief.\n• The messenger from Honouliuli brings news of Nāmakaokapāo'o's exceptional strength and his father's death. The detail about Nāmakaokapāo'o's father's head being cast into the deep sea is noteworthy, as it may allude to the practice of human sacrifice or the disposal of corpses in ancient Hawaiian culture.\n– The distance of five miles mentioned in the passage may be symbolic, representing a significant or impressive feat. In Hawaiian culture, distances and measurements were often used to convey importance or magnitude, rather than being strictly literal.\n• 'Ama'u's reaction to the news is telling, as he expresses a desire to kill Nāmakaokapāo'o if he is strong, but not if he is weak. This may indicate that 'Ama'u is motivated by a desire to prove his own strength or to eliminate potential threats to his power.\n– The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o overhears 'Ama'u's words suggests that he may be aware of the dangers or challenges that lie ahead, and may be preparing himself for future conflicts or encounters with 'Ama'u.\n• The passage as a whole may be seen as a setup for the conflicts and challenges that Nāmakaokapāo'o will face in the future, as he navigates the complexities of ancient Hawaiian society and confronts the ambitions and motivations of other characters, such as 'Ama'u.\n– Allegorically, the story may be exploring themes of strength, power, and the responsibilities that come with them. Nāmakaokapāo'o's exceptional strength and 'Ama'u's desire to kill him may represent the tensions between individual power and collective or societal expectations, which were significant concerns in ancient Hawaiian culture.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
