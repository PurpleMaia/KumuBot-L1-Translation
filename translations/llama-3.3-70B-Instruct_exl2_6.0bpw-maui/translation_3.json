  "llama-3.3_translation": "<translation>In the afternoon of their day in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went to the place of the canoe builders, and the birds were crying, with the sound of the adze accompanying the hewing. And when they arrived under the tree of that canoe, Kauakahi was sitting alone with the adze. At that time, the canoe builders of Keawenuiaumi were at the base of the canoe, the birds perched, calling out: “Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, it's a bundle of rubbish. It's a bad canoe, a useless canoe. It's a canoe that cannot go out to sea.”</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”"
