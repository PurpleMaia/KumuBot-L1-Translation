Then Nāmakaokapāo'o went back and lit a fire to broil four sweet potato vines on a fire pit that was burning. As he was broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather came back and reached him and asked Nāmakaokapāo'o's mother, Pōka'ī, and she said, \"No.\" Puali'i said, \"Yes, his head and eyes as food to go with the sweet potatoes that I'll eat today.

The pāo'o fish is likely used as a poetic reference to the head (po'o) of the ulua fish, which is a significant symbol in Hawaiian culture, especially during the 'Ai Kapu era. The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o may allude to the idea of watching or observing, and in this context, Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions can be seen as a form of observation or commentary on the societal norms of his time.\n– The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o is tearing apart the sweet potato patches, one on top of the other, may symbolize the dismantling of the 'Ai Kapu system, which was a complex set of rules and regulations that governed the lives of Hawaiians during that time period. The sweet potato was a staple crop in Hawaiian society, and its destruction may represent the upheaval of traditional practices and the emergence of new ideas.\n• The numbers mentioned in the passage, such as 2, 4, and 40, are likely significant and may hold esoteric meaning. In Hawaiian culture, numbers often had symbolic meanings, and these numbers may be used to convey a specific message or theme. For example, the number 40 may represent a complete or perfect amount, while the number 2 may symbolize duality or balance.\n– The image of the sweet potato leaves rising like a mound may also be symbolic, representing the idea of growth, abundance, or fertility. The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o is broiling four sweet potato vines on a fire pit may represent the idea of transformation or change, as the sweet potatoes are being cooked and prepared for consumption.\n• The conversation between Puali'i and Pōka'ī is also noteworthy, as it reveals the dynamics of their relationship and the cultural norms of their time. Puali'i's threat to eat Nāmakaokapāo'o's head and eyes as food to go with the sweet potatoes may be seen as a form of intimidation or control, and Pōka'ī's response of \"No\" may indicate her disagreement or disapproval of Puali'i's actions.\n– The fact that Puali'i mentions eating Nāmakaokapāo'o's head and eyes may also be symbolic, representing the idea of consuming or destroying the old ways of thinking. The head and eyes may represent the source of knowledge, wisdom, or power, and Puali'i's threat to eat them may symbolize the idea of suppressing or eliminating these qualities.\n• The passage as a whole may be seen as an allegory for the changes that were taking place in Hawaiian society during the 'Ai Kapu era. Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions may represent the desire for change and the dismantling of traditional practices, while Puali'i's response may represent the resistance to change and the desire to maintain the status quo. The conversation between Puali'i and Pōka'ī may represent the complexities and challenges of navigating these changes, and the need for adaptability and resilience in the face of uncertainty.",

  "reference_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**• The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \\[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;"
