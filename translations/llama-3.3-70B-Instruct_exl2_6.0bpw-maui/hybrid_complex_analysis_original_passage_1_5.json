Nāmakaokapāo‘o's body at that time was very weak, with two swellings and a protruding navel, and her illness was not improving, she was very frail. When they arrived at the sweet potato field, Nāmakaokapāo‘o instructed the children, \"Remove all the vines and leaves from the sweet potatoes, don't leave any that are still growing.\" However, the children were lazy, so they just pulled gently on the sweet potatoes, without removing the vines.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "This passage offers a glimpse into the daily life and struggles of ancient Hawaiian individuals, particularly Nāmakaokapāo‘o, who is depicted as frail and ill. The mention of sweet potato fields, or \"māla ‘uala,\" highlights the importance of sweet potatoes as a staple crop in Hawaiian agriculture. The instruction to remove all vines and leaves from the sweet potatoes suggests a common farming practice aimed at promoting healthy plant growth and maximizing yields.\n\nThe characterization of Nāmakaokapāo‘o's physical condition, including her weak body, swellings, and protruding navel, may indicate a state of poor health or malnutrition, which could have been prevalent in ancient Hawaiian society due to limited access to healthcare and variable food availability. The fact that she is still involved in daily activities, such as overseeing the children's work in the fields, demonstrates her resilience and the importance of community and family in Hawaiian culture.\n\nLinguistically, this passage features several notable aspects of the Hawaiian language. The use of the phrase \"i ia wā\" (at that time) and \"i nā māla ‘uala\" (in the sweet potato fields) illustrates the language's ability to convey specific temporal and spatial relationships. The employment of descriptive words like \"‘u‘uku loa\" (very weak) and \"‘elua kapua‘i\" (two swellings) showcases the language's capacity for vivid and detailed descriptions.\n\nThe passage also employs idiomatic expressions, such as \"e lewalewa ana nō\" (she was very frail), which adds to the narrative's emotional depth and cultural nuance. The use of the phrase \"kāohi mālie nō\" (they just pulled gently) to describe the children's actions conveys a sense of laziness and reluctance, highlighting the challenges of farming and the importance of diligence in agricultural work.\n\nHistorically, this passage may be significant in understanding the social and economic dynamics of ancient Hawaiian society. The mention of Puali‘i's fishing activities and Nāmakaokapāo‘o's involvement in farming suggests a division of labor and a reliance on both marine and terrestrial resources for sustenance. The narrative may also allude to the importance of ohana (family) and community in Hawaiian culture, as Nāmakaokapāo‘o is shown to be involved in the care and instruction of the children, despite her poor health.\n\nFurthermore, the passage may be seen as a reflection of the cultural values of mahina ‘ai (farming and cultivation) and mālama ‘āina (caring for the land), which were essential to the survival and well-being of ancient Hawaiian communities. The emphasis on proper farming techniques, such as removing vines and leaves from sweet potatoes, highlights the importance of responsible land stewardship and the need for future generations to respect and care for the ‘āina (land).",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
