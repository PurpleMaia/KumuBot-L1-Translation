Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the rafters of the house, separated the thatch of the roof and the lashing, and slept in the middle on top of the rafters.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Then, his mother took him to hide in the cave of Waipouli. The mother hid, and then returned to their house in Keahumoa, and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the rafters of the house, separated the thatch of the roof and the lashing, and slept in the middle on top of the rafters.</translation>\n\n<commentary>This paragraph continues the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo'o's story, detailing his actions and interactions with his mother after a previous event, likely related to his destructive behavior.</commentary>\n\n• The story begins with **A laila** (then), indicating a continuation of the narrative from previous events, and **lawe akula ia i kona makuahine** (his mother took him), showing the mother's initiative to hide her son, possibly to protect him or to evade consequences of his actions.\n– The phrase **e hūnā ma ke ana o Waipouli** (to hide in the cave of Waipouli) suggests that the mother is seeking a secure or sacred place to conceal her son, with **Waipouli** possibly being a location with spiritual or geographical significance.\n• The mother's actions, **A nalo ka makuahine, ho'i maila ia ā ko lākou hale ma Keahumoa, noho ihola** (the mother hid, and then returned to their house in Keahumoa, and stayed there), imply a sense of caution and possibly fear, as she returns to their home without her son, indicating a separation or a strategic decision to keep Nāmakaokapāo'o hidden.\n– The mention of **Keahumoa** as their home location introduces another geographical reference, which might be significant in understanding the story's setting or the characters' affiliations.\n• Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions, **Pi'i a'ela 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o ā luna o kaupoku o ka hale** (Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the rafters of the house), demonstrate his agility and possibly his desire for solitude or a unique perspective, as he positions himself above the household activities.\n– The detail **wehe a'ela i ka mau'u o ke kua a me ke alo** (separated the thatch of the roof and the lashing) suggests a deliberate act of modifying his environment, which could symbolize his impact on the social or structural norms around him.\n– The final image of Nāmakaokapāo'o, **a moe ihola ma waena i luna pono o ke kaupoku** (and slept in the middle on top of the rafters), presents a picture of him in a state of rest or contemplation, ideally positioned above the household, which might allegorically represent his detachment from or observation of the worldly matters below.\n• Considering the 'Ai Kapu era's social and religious context, Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions and his mother's decisions might reflect the challenges of navigating a society with strict rules and spiritual beliefs, where certain behaviors or individuals could be seen as disruptive or sacred.\n– The name **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) continues to hold significance, as **pāo'o** can be poetically linked to **po'o** (head), and **maka** (eyes) might symbolize insight, wisdom, or the ability to see beyond the ordinary, reflecting Nāmakaokapāo'o's unique perspective or role in the narrative.\n– The overall scenario could be interpreted as an allegory for the transition from the 'Ai Kapu period to a more progressive era, with Nāmakaokapāo'o embodying the spirit of change or the questioning of traditional norms, and his mother representing the caution or the wisdom needed to navigate such transitions.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
