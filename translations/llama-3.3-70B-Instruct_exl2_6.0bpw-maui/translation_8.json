  "llama-3.3_translation": "<translation>The parents said: “Child, what is the canoe inside the calabash, with the mast and the outrigger?” The child replied: “If the calabash is turned upside down and the sail is placed inside, is it not a canoe? It is a canoe. If the calabash is turned upside down and the mast is placed inside, is it not a mast? It is a mast. If the calabash is turned upside down and the outrigger is placed inside, is it not an outrigger? It is an outrigger.”</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”"
