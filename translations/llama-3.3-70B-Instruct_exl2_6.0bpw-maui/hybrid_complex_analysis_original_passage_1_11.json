Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the rafters of the house, separated the thatch of the roof and the walls, and slept in the middle on top of the rafters.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The story appears to be setting the stage for further events, possibly involving the character Nāmakaokapāo'o and the location of Keahumoa.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
