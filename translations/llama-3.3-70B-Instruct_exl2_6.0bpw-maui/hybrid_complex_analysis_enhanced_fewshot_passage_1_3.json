Puali'i saw Pōka'ī, liked her, and said, \"I want you as my woman.\" Pōka'ī replied, \"Why would you want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is worn out.\" Puali'i said, \"Those things don't matter; if you like me, let's sleep together.\" Pōka'ī agreed, and she went with her husband and Puali'i to the plains of Keahumoa to live.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "• The passage introduces a new character, Pua-li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), who arrives from Līhu'e (perhaps a place of spiritual or ancestral significance, considering the etymology of Lī-hu'e: Lī - \"to ascend, climb\" and hu'e - \"to drift, float\"), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay, possibly symbolizing a transition or a place of spiritual growth).\n• Pua-li'i visits Pō-ka-'ī's (perhaps \"night falls upon the high chief\") house, which is a common practice in Hawaiian culture, especially during the 'Ai Kapu era, where hospitality and generosity were highly valued. This custom is rooted in the concept of aloha (love, compassion) and the importance of building relationships within the community.\n• Pua-li'i is immediately drawn to Pō-ka-'ī and expresses his desire to be with her as his wahine (woman, partner). Pō-ka-'ī, however, is hesitant due to her perceived flaws, having given birth to a child (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o) and feeling that her body is worn out. This exchange highlights the cultural emphasis on physical appearance and the societal pressures on women during the 'Ai Kapu era.\n• Pua-li'i's response, \"He mea 'ole ia mau mea, ke makemake 'oe ia'u, e moe kāua\" (\"Those things don't matter; if you like me, let's sleep together\"), suggests a more progressive and accepting attitude, which may be seen as a contrast to the traditional 'Ai Kapu values. This could be interpreted as a symbolic representation of the changing times and the shift towards more Westernized values.\n• The agreement between Pō-ka-'ī and Pua-li'i to be together, marked by the phrase \"‘Ae akula ‘o Pōka‘ī\" (\"Pōka'ī agreed\"), signifies a new beginning and a potential departure from the traditional norms. The fact that they relocate to Ke-ahu-moa (heap of chickens), a place in Līhu'e, may symbolize a fresh start, a new cycle of life, or a connection to the ancestral lands.\n– The name Ke-ahu-moa can be broken down into its components: Ke-ahu (the heap, pile) and moa (chicken). In Hawaiian culture, chickens were considered a symbol of fertility, abundance, and spiritual growth. The relocation to Keahumoa may represent a desire for spiritual renewal, fertility, or a connection to the natural world.\n• The passage as a whole can be seen as an allegory for the complexities of human relationships, the challenges of societal expectations, and the quest for personal growth and transformation. The characters' interactions and decisions may be interpreted as a reflection of the cultural and historical context in which they live, with the 'Ai Kapu era serving as a backdrop for the narrative.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
