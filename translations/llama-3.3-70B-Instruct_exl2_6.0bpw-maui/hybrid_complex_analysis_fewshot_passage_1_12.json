'A-ma'u, for instance, may symbolize the hidden or unseen forces that Nāmakaokapāo'o will face.\n• The description of the four warriors, including a huge, strong man (kanahā kumamāwalu kānaka ka nui), emphasizes their formidable nature, setting the stage for a confrontation with Nāmakaokapāo'o.\n– The use of numbers in this context may be symbolic, with four often representing stability, structure, or the four cardinal directions in Hawaiian cosmology. The fact that all four warriors are of the same caliber (pēlā ā pau nā po'e 'ehā) suggests a balance or unity among them, which will be contrasted with Nāmakaokapāo'o's singular, extraordinary abilities.\n• The warriors' arrival at the plain of Ke-ahumoa (the dew of life or the life-giving dew) and their entry into an empty house may symbolize their search for life, vitality, or spiritual nourishment, which they hope to find by confronting Nāmakaokapāo'o.\n– The name Ke-ahumoa can be etymologically broken down into ke- (the) + ahu- (dew, mist) + m oa (life, vitality), highlighting the life-giving properties of dew in Hawaiian culture. This could allegorically represent the quest for spiritual rejuvenation or the struggle between the old, stagnant ways (represented by the empty house) and the new, vibrant forces embodied by Nāmakaokapāo'o.\n• Nāmakaokapāo'o's call from above (i luna o ka upoku) and the warriors' inability to see him (a'ohe na'e he 'ike 'ia o ke kino) create a sense of mystery and otherworldliness around his character.\n– This interaction may symbolize the clash between the physical, worldly realm of the warriors and the spiritual, mystical realm that Nāmakaokapāo'o seems to inhabit. The fact that Nāmakaokapāo'o is \"up here\" (i luna nei) may indicate his connection to the divine, the heavens, or a higher state of consciousness.\n• The warriors' discovery of Nāmakaokapāo'o and their ensuing conversation reveal their motivations: they have come to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, who is perceived as a little boy (keiki 'u'uku) with extraordinary strength (ikaika) and bravery (koa loa), and who has committed a taboo act by killing his own father (Puali'i).\n– The emphasis on Nāmakaokapāo'o's youth, strength, and bravery serves to underscore his exceptional nature and the challenges he poses to the established order. The fact that he killed his father, Puali'i, may be seen as a transgression against the traditional norms of the 'Ai Kapu era, where respect for elders and ancestors was deeply ingrained. This act could symbolize the breaking of old patterns and the emergence of a new, potentially disruptive force in Hawaiian society.</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
