When the sweet potatoes were ready, Puali‘i said in his promise, \"When the head of the ulua fish and the sweet potato are cooked, then Puali‘i will eat, and afterwards, his wife Pōka‘ī and the others will eat.\" Therefore, Puali‘i went down to the sea of Honouliuli to fish for fish to eat with the sweet potatoes.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "• The passage describes Puali‘i's life as a farmer and fisherman, highlighting his connection to the land and the sea.\n  – This reflects the traditional Hawaiian emphasis on living in harmony with nature and relying on the land and sea for sustenance (Malolo, 1951).\n  – The mention of sweet potato fields and fishing also points to the importance of agriculture and marine resources in pre-contact Hawaiian subsistence practices.\n\n• The name Nāmakaokapāo‘o can be broken down into Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, which roughly translates to \"the eyes of the shark\" or \"the shark's gaze\".\n  – This name may symbolize the protection and provision that the land and sea offer to Puali‘i and his family, as sharks were considered ‘aumākua (ancestral spirits) in Hawaiian culture (Beckwith, 1970).\n  – The name may also allude to the concept of mana (spiritual power) and the connection between the natural world and human well-being.\n\n• The character of Puali‘i and his actions can be seen as an allegory for the traditional Hawaiian values of hard work, self-sufficiency, and community sharing.\n  – Puali‘i's promise to eat only after the sweet potatoes and fish are prepared suggests a sense of responsibility and stewardship towards his family and community (Kame‘eleihiwa, 1992).\n  – The fact that he goes fishing to supplement their food supply also highlights the importance of cooperation and reciprocity between humans and the natural environment.\n\n• The passage may also reflect social commentary on the changing times and the impact of post-contact influences on traditional Hawaiian practices.\n  – The fact that the sweet potato fields have been left untouched \"to this day\" may suggest a sense of nostalgia or loss for the past, potentially alluding to the disruptions caused by the 1819 abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu era and the subsequent introduction of Western practices (Davenport, 1994).\n  – The narrative may be critiquing the decline of traditional subsistence practices and the erosion of cultural values in the face of colonialism and modernization.\n\n• The use of numerical symbolism and riddles in the passage is notable, particularly in the phrase \"‘elua āna mau māla ‘uala\" (two large sweet potato fields).\n  – The number two may represent balance, reciprocity, or duality, echoing the concept of aloha ‘āina (love for the land) and the interdependence between humans and the natural world (McGregor, 2007).\n  – The riddle-like quality of Puali‘i's promise may also suggest a deeper, spiritual significance to the narrative, inviting the reader to interpret the story on multiple levels.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
