  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"I know, Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great person, and I have gone to Ko'olau, and I am his namesake.\" They said: \"No, it's you, that's what we've heard, so you will die at our hands, you won't live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Let's go down and fight.\" When they went down, Nāmakaokapāo'o killed them all, except for one person, who was the one that ran away and met 'Ama'u in Waikīkī, and told him about their death, and cried out to spread the news so 'Ama'u would hear.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"I know, Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great person, and I have gone to Ko'olau, and I am his namesake.\" They said: \"No, it's you, that's what we've heard, so you will die at our hands, you won't live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Let's go down and fight.\" When they went down, Nāmakaokapāo'o killed them all, except for one person, who was the one that ran away and met 'Ama'u in Waikīkī, and told him about their death, and cried out to spread the news so 'Ama'u would hear.</translation>\n\n<commentary>This paragraph is part of a narrative where Nāmakaokapāo'o is interacting with a group of people, asserting his identity and connection to a great person, also named Nāmakaokapāo'o, and eventually engages in a fierce battle with them.</commentary>\n\n• The narrative begins with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o claiming to be the namesake of a great person, also named Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, and stating that he has gone to Ko'olau. \n– This could imply that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o has traveled to Ko'olau, a region on the island of O'ahu, in search of his namesake or to connect with his ancestral heritage.\n– The name Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o can be broken down into its components: Nā- (the), maka- (eyes), o- (of), ka- (the), pāo'o (a type of fish). This name may be symbolic of the person's ability to \"see\" or perceive things in a unique way, or to be connected to the spiritual realm.\n• The group of people responds to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's claim by denying it and stating that they have heard it is actually him who is the great person. \n– This exchange may represent a conflict between different understandings of identity, power, and authority, which is a common theme in Hawaiian narratives.\n– The 'Ai Kapu era, which emphasized the importance of genealogy and ancestral connections, may be relevant to this exchange, as Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's claim to be a namesake of a great person could be seen as a way of asserting his own status and authority.\n• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o proposes that they settle the matter through battle, saying \"Ho'i aku ho'i hā kākou i lalo e hakakā ai\" (\"Let's go down and fight\"). \n– This phrase may be an example of the Hawaiian cultural practice of resolving conflicts through physical combat or competition, which was common in the 'Ai Kapu era.\n– The use of the word \"hakakā\" (to fight or struggle) may also have allegorical significance, representing the struggle between different forces or perspectives.\n• The outcome of the battle is that Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o kills all of the group except for one person, who escapes and meets 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. \n– The name 'Ama'u can be broken down into its components: 'A- (a prefix indicating a person or thing), ma'u (to gather or assemble). This name may be symbolic of the person's role as a gatherer or collector of information or people.\n– The fact that the escaped person meets 'Ama'u in Waikīkī and tells him about the battle may represent the spread of news and information through social networks, which was an important aspect of Hawaiian culture.\n• The narrative ends with the escaped person crying out to spread the news of the battle, so that 'Ama'u will hear. \n– This may represent the importance of sharing information and news in Hawaiian culture, as well as the role of 'Ama'u as a kind of leader or authority figure who needs to be informed about important events.\n– The use of the word \"koe\" (to cry out or shout) may also have allegorical significance, representing the need to share information and news in order to bring about change or justice.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
