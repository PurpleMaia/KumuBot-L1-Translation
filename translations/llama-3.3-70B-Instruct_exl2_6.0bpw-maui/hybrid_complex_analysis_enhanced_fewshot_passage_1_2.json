Pōka'ī stayed with her newborn, Nāmakaokapāo'o, and later gave birth. At this birth, Pōka'ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo'o were extremely exhausted.",
  "llama-3.3-70B-Instruct_exl2_6.0bpw-maui_commentary": "• The passage introduces the location of Hō'ae'ae in 'Ewa, which is significant as it is the place where Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o was conceived. 'Ewa is a district on the island of O'ahu, and Hō'ae'ae likely refers to a specific area or ahupua'a within that district. The name Hō'ae'ae can be broken down into Hō-ae-ae, where \"hō\" means \"to plead\" or \"to beg,\" \"ae\" means \"to rise\" or \"to ascend,\" and the repetition of \"ae\" may emphasize the action or intensity of the rising. This etymology could imply a place of spiritual or ancestral significance, where prayers or pleas are made to the gods.\n– The conception of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o at this location may hold allegorical meaning, as it could represent the union of spiritual and worldly forces, symbolizing the beginning of a new era or the dawn of a new understanding.\n• The passage also mentions Pō-ka-'ī giving birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, and Kau-lua-kaha'i returning to his land. The name Kau-lua-kaha'i can be broken down into Kau-lua-kaha'i, where \"kau\" means \"season\" or \"time,\" \"lua\" means \"two,\" and \"kaha'i\" refers to a place or a stratum. This etymology could imply a connection to the cycles of time, the balance between dual forces, or the navigation of different realms or dimensions.\n– The fact that Kau-lua-kaha'i returns to his land after Pō-ka-'ī gives birth may suggest a separation or a distinction between the spiritual and worldly realms, highlighting the different roles or responsibilities that each character embodies.\n• The phrase \"he 'ilihune loa 'o Pōka'ī a me kāna keiki 'o Nāmakaokapāo'o\" describes Pōka'ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo'o as being extremely exhausted after the birth. The word \"'ilihune\" can be broken down into 'ili-hune, where \"'ili\" means \"to cling\" or \"to stick,\" and \"hune\" means \"to be tired\" or \"to be exhausted.\" This etymology could imply a deep emotional or physical connection between Pōka'ī and her child, as well as a sense of depletion or exhaustion after the birth.\n– This exhaustion may be seen as a symbol of the challenges and hardships that Pōka'ī and Nāmakaokapāo'o will face in their journey, as well as the idea that their bond will be tested and transformed throughout the story. In the context of Hawaiian cultural tradition, the 'Ai Kapu era, and the historical period in which this story takes place, the themes of conception, birth, and exhaustion may be linked to the cycles of nature, the balance between spiritual and worldly forces, and the navigation of different realms or dimensions.",

When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",

When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
