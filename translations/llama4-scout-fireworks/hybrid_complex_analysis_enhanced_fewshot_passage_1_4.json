  "llama4-scout-fireworks_translation": "They stayed there, working the land, two long sweet potato patches that remain to this day, and the name of those patches was given by Nāmakaokapāo'o and remains so to this day. When the sweet potatoes were ready, Puali'i said in his promise, \"When we two eat the head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato, then Puali'i will eat, and then his wife, Pōka'ī, and the others will eat.\" So, Puali'i went to the shore of Honouliuli to go fishing to catch fish to eat with the sweet potatoes.",
  "llama4-scout-fireworks_commentary": "• This paragraph continues to describe the lives of Puali'i, Pōka'ī, and Nāmakaokapāo'o, emphasizing their agricultural activities and the cultural practices of the time. \n– The passage mentions \"ʻelua āna mau māla ʻuala lōʻihi\" (two long sweet potato patches), indicating that Puali'i and Pōka'ī were actively engaged in farming, which was a crucial aspect of Hawaiian subsistence and economy.\n• The naming of the sweet potato patches by Nāmakaokapāo'o, \"ʻo Nāmakaokapāo'o ā hiki i kēia lā\" (Nāmakaokapāo'o [named them] and [the name] remains so to this day), suggests that Nāmakaokapāo'o has a significant role or connection to the land and the family's agricultural activities.\n– The use of \"ā hiki i kēia lā\" (until this day) implies a sense of continuity and tradition, highlighting the importance of preserving cultural knowledge and practices.\n• Puali'i's statement, \"Aia ā kālua ke poʻo o ka ulua me ka ʻuala, a ʻai ʻo Pualiʻi, a laila, noa, ʻai kāna wahine, Pōkaʻī a me nā mea ʻē aʻe\" (When we two eat the head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato, then Puali'i will eat, and then his wife, Pōka'ī, and the others will eat), reveals a cultural practice where the head of the ulua fish was considered a delicacy and was eaten in a ceremonial or ritualistic context.\n– The mention of \"ke poʻo o ka ulua\" (the head of the ulua fish) and its pairing with \"ka ʻuala\" (sweet potatoes) may symbolize the balance and harmony between the sea and the land, which were essential aspects of Hawaiian cultural and spiritual practices.\n– The term \"noa\" (free, unrestricted) in this context may indicate that the consumption of food was not restricted by the 'Ai Kapu rules, which dictated who could eat certain foods and when.\n• Puali'i's decision to go fishing at Honouliuli, \"Iho akula ʻo Pualiʻi i kai o Honouliuli e lawaiʻa i iʻa ʻai pū me ka ʻuala\" (Puali'i went to the shore of Honouliuli to go fishing to catch fish to eat with the sweet potatoes), demonstrates the importance of fishing and seafood in the Hawaiian diet and economy.\n– The location of Honouliuli, which is associated with 'Ewa, Oʻahu, may hold cultural significance, as it was an area known for its rich marine resources and was likely a site for fishing and other subsistence activities.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
