  "reference_translation": "This call and reply was repeated twice before the guards heard it, when they sat up and listened to the call and they understood the meaning conveyed by the owl in its call. At this one of the guards said to his companion: “Say, this must be Laukiamanuikahiki, the king’s own daughter.” The other replied: “No, this cannot be the one, for she was to come in a red canoe having red sails, red paddles, red men, a large canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men; these I understand are the things that should accompany her; this girl on the other hand is a poor girl for she has come without any of these things.” The two again listened to the conversation between the owl and girl. After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter. They arrived at the home of Makiioeoe after midnight and roused him up saying: “Say, you wake up.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “There is an owl right over the pig house where the girl is held who called out to the girl in the following way:",

One said to the other: “This could be the chief's daughter, Laukiamanuikahiki.” The other said: “No, her canoe is red, her paddle is red, her oar is red, her servant is red, her large and small canoes are red, her large and small servants are red, that is her custom when she comes, she is not some poor chief's daughter.” They both listened again to the words of the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki. “Let us go and tell the chief, this is the chief's daughter.” One said “Yes.” They went before the chief Makiioeoe in the night, and woke him: “Get up, arise.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “An owl, it is perched right above the thatched roof where the chief's daughter is. The owl spoke like this, and we heard it call out to the chief's daughter.\n</translation>"
