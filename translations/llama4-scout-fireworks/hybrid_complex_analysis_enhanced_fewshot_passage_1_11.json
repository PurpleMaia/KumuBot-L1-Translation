Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up to the top of the roof of the house, opened the thatch of the back and the front, and lay down in the middle on top of the roof.",
  "llama4-scout-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nThen, he took his mother and hid her in the spring of Waipouli. After the mother disappeared, he returned to their house at Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up to the top of the roof of the house, opened the thatch of the back and the front, and lay down in the middle on top of the roof.\n\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• This paragraph continues the narrative of Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions after his stepfather, Puali'i, threatened to kill him. \n– The hiding of his mother, Pō-ka-'ī (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high chief'), in the spring of Wai-pou-li (perhaps spring/tide/surge of Poi/fermented taro; Wai: water, Pou: post/stake/drinking stick, Li: to carry in a net/basket) is a pivotal moment in the story.\n• The act of hiding his mother in a spring may symbolize a desire to protect her and keep her safe, possibly alluding to the protective nature of their familial bond.\n– In Hawaiian culture, springs and water sources are often considered sacred and life-giving, which may be significant in this context.\n• Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions of climbing to the top of the roof, opening the thatch, and laying down may represent a form of withdrawal or escape from the conflicts and tensions below.\n– The roof of a Hawaiian house, particularly in the 'Ai Kapu era, was often considered a sacred space, and Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions may be seen as a way of seeking refuge or spiritual connection.\n• This event may also foreshadow future developments in the story, potentially hinting at Nāmakaokapāo'o's connection to the spiritual realm or his role as a mediator between the natural and supernatural worlds.\n– The name Nāmakaokapāo'o (the eyes of the pāo'o fish) may be significant in this context, as the pāo'o fish was considered a symbol of abundance and fertility in Hawaiian culture. \n\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
