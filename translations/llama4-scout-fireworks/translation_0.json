  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo.",
  "llama4-scout-fireworks_translation": "<translation>\nIn this story, it was said that the body of Kana was very long and huge and fearful to look at. As he was lying down, his body stretched out at great length, and the house of Halauoloolo was also stretched out. From the mountain to near the sea, his body stretched out at great length, and likewise the house of Halauoloolo.\n</translation>"
