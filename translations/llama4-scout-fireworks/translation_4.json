  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",

The mother looked at her daughter and said: \"You, it seems, are the one who has the ancestral blood, not your father's side which has no ancestral blood.\" Pumaia said: \"What are you two whispering about?\" \"No, we were just lamenting our impending death, you are not of the side without ancestral blood.\" Pumaia said to the woman: \"Let us go; take me along and set me free.\" They descended from Pukouola and on the side of Pauoa valley they went and reached the Alekoki stream, from there to Maemae, that is how they descended and when daylight broke, they arrived at Nuuanu.\n</translation>"
