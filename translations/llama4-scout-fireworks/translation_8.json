  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”",

And when the fishhook is inside the container, is it a fishhook?\" \nThe child replied: \"If the canoe is made to lie down and placed inside the container, is it not still a canoe? It is a canoe. If the fishhook is made to lie down and placed inside the container, is it not still a fishhook? It is a fishhook. If one catches a shark and places it inside the container, is it not still a shark? It is a shark.\"\n</translation>"
