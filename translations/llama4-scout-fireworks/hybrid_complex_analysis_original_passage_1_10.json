  "llama4-scout-fireworks_translation": "Then Puali'i died, and Nāmakaokapāo'o went up to his mother, Pōka'i, and they stayed there, but Nāmakaokapāo'o did not eat food. At that time, 'Ama'u, the ali'i of O'ahu, was residing in Waikīkī. A man from Honouliuli arrived in Waikīkī where the ali'i was staying. He said: \"O ali'i! There is a very strong little child, his father has died and his head was thrown into the sea, it is a very long distance, five miles long. Hearing this, 'Ama'u thought to himself, \"If I were to fight him, I would surely die; but if I do not fight him, then he has great strength.\" While he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o heard these words about him.",
  "llama4-scout-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

At that time, 'Ama'u, the ali'i of O'ahu, was residing in Waikīkī. A man from Honouliuli arrived in Waikīkī where the ali'i was staying. He said: \"O ali'i! There is a very strong little child, his father has died and his head was thrown into the sea, it is a very long distance, five miles long.

The story introduces key characters and settings, including 'Ama'u, an ali'i (chief) of O'ahu, and Nāmakaokapāo'o, a child of extraordinary abilities. The passage sets the stage for a confrontation or significant event involving these characters.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
