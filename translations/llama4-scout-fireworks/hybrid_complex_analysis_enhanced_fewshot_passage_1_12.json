When they arrived at the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, (but) there was no one (inside). As they were about to leave, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from above the roof. When they heard the voice, they did not see the body, and they asked: \"Where are you speaking from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied: \"I am right here above (you).\" Eight people climbed up, four on the back of the house, and four in the front of the house, and that's when they found Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"What brings you to my place?\" They replied: \"We came to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o, a small child like you, (who is) incredibly strong and brave, and who killed his stepfather, Puali'i.\"",
  "llama4-scout-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
