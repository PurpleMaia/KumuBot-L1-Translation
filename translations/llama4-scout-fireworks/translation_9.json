  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession.",

Wailea had a younger brother, Kalenaihaleauau, who was the husband of Kukuipahu, a chief of Kohala. Kaipalaoa was born and grew up, his father, a chief of Kauai, came to visit, but he died at Kalanialiiloa, a sacred chief of Kauai, an expert in the protocol of royalty, who had just beaten the bones of a native, at Halepaiwi, a place still completely surrounded by native bones. Halepaki also knew the protocol of royalty, he studied it, but he did not master it, so he went to Kauai and died there at Kalanialiiloa. Pueonuiokona was the chief of Kauai.\n</translation>"
