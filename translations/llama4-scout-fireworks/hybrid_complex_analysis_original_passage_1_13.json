  "llama4-scout-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nThen Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"I know that Nāmakaokapāo'o is a great chief, and he has come to Ko'olau, and I am his name.\" They said: \"No, you are (the one we have heard of), that is our hearing, therefore, we will kill you, you will not live.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Let us go down and engage in combat.\" When they went down, Nāmakaokapāo'o was being chased, and when all were dead, one man remained, he was the one who ran and found 'Ama'u in Waikīkī, he told 'Ama'u that they had all died, and he remained to tell 'Ama'u.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\nThis passage is part of a larger narrative section that appears to be discussing the exploits and conflicts of a chief or warrior named Nāmakaokapāo'o, likely within the context of ancient Hawaiian mythology or historical accounts. The narrative seems to be setting the stage for a confrontation between Nāmakaokapāo'o and a group of individuals, ultimately leading to a tragic outcome for most of the characters involved. The passage showcases the use of Hawaiian linguistic features, such as the repetition of names and the use of rhetorical dialogue, which are common in traditional Hawaiian storytelling. \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
