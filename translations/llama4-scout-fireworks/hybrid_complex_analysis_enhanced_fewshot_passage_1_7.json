All the children saw him and ran to a distance because they were afraid of Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: \"Hey! Here is the adze in my hand, it is for cutting off your head today, and your head will be cut off, then we'll eat the sweet potatoes together, and I'll eat first, then you'll be free.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o did not listen to Puali'i's words, so Puali'i spoke again. Puali'i was about to cut Nāmakaokapāo'o with the adze when Nāmakaokapāo'o prayed his death prayer for Puali'i. The prayer was like this: \n\"Only the eyes of my pāo'o fish,\nHapupu'u and hāpāpa'a, \nEat or spare,\nSpare perhaps Nākukui'aimakaokalani,\nKukui'aimakaokalani is the one,\nMy little brother is this one,\nNāmakaokai'ā is the great chief of Hawai'i,\nDistract, distract only the delusion,\nThe people are with the spear,\nThe spear is with the sounding board,\nDeath to Nāmakaokapāo'o.\"",
  "llama4-scout-fireworks_commentary": "• Paragraph 7 opens with Pua-li'i seizing the adze and approaching Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, who was broiling his four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the children saw Pua-li'i and ran away because they were afraid of him. This fear is likely due to Pua-li'i's violent behavior and aggressive demeanor, which is consistent with his previous actions and words; \n– Pua-li'i threatens Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, saying that he will cut off his head with the adze and then eat the sweet potatoes together, with Pua-li'i eating first. This act of violence and cannibalism is a clear indication of Pua-li'i's disregard for human life and his adherence to the 'Ai Kapu culture, where human sacrifice was practiced; \n• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o does not respond or react to Pua-li'i's threat, which prompts Pua-li'i to prepare to cut him with the adze. However, at this moment, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o prays his death prayer for Pua-li'i; \n– The prayer recited by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is rich in symbolism and cultural references. The pāo'o fish is likely a reference to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's name, which means \"the eyes of the pāo'o fish.\" The use of this imagery may be a metaphor for Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's own vulnerability and mortality; \n– The names Kukui'aimakaokalani and Nākukui'aimakaokalani are mentioned in the prayer, which may be references to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o's own identity and lineage. The use of these names may be a way of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o asserting his connection to his family and ancestors; \n– The prayer also contains references to the people, spears, and sounding boards, which may be symbolic of the cultural and spiritual practices of the 'Ai Kapu era. The use of these images may be a way of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o invoking the power of his ancestors and the spiritual forces that govern the world; \n– The final line of the prayer, \"Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo'o,\" is a declaration of death for Pua-li'i. This line may be seen as a form of counter-curse or counter-magic, where Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is attempting to turn the tables on Pua-li'i and assert his own power and agency; \n• The use of prayer and spiritual practices in this passage highlights the importance of spiritual and cultural traditions in Hawaiian society. The 'Ai Kapu era was a time of great spiritual and cultural change, and the practices and rituals described in this passage reflect the complex and often contradictory nature of this era; \n• The character of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o is portrayed as a powerful and resourceful individual who is able to use his spiritual and cultural knowledge to counter Pua-li'i's violence. This portrayal may be seen as a reflection of the importance of intelligence, strategic thinking, and spiritual power in Hawaiian culture.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
