  "llama4-scout-fireworks_translation": "While they were living (together), Puali'i arrived from Līhu'e, a good man, from inland, to go fishing offshore at Honouliuli. He visited the home of Pōka'ī. Puali'i looked at Pōka'ī and liked her, and said, \"I'd like you to be my woman.\" Pōka'ī replied, \"How can you possibly want me? I have given birth to a child, and my body is ruined.\" Puali'i said, \"Those things don't matter. If you like me, let's sleep together.\" Pōka'ī agreed. And Pōka'ī, with her child and Puali'i, went to live on the plains of Keahumoa.",
  "llama4-scout-fireworks_commentary": "• This paragraph introduces Pua-li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described as a good man, from in-land at Lī-hu'e (Wāhiāwā), who had come to go fishing at Hon-o-uliuli (bay of many dark or secret things), likely a fishing location in 'Ewa, but somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-'ī was living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o. \n– In the 'Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to every destination and it was normal to call in to the house of strangers and ask for food and water. It was normal to receive strangers at one's home and provide them with food and water, and it was considered rude to refuse generosity. \n– This is a custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the reason Pua-li'i called in at Pōka'ī's house and why Pōka'ī received Pua-li'i in her home, where he observed how she was living.\n\n• Pua-li'i falls in love with Pō-ka-'ī and proposes a long-term relationship. \n– Pō-ka-'ī (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high chief') expresses hesitation due to a negative self-image, citing that she had given birth to a child and that her body was ruined.\n– Pua-li'i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a long-term relationship and acknowledge each other as ʻkāne' (boyfriend, husband, long-term lover) and ʻwahine' (girlfriend, wife, long-term lover). \n– The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Lī-hu'e (Wāhiāwā), where Pua-li'i is from, to live.\n\n• The conversation between Pua-li'i and Pō-ka-'ī shows that Pua-li'i is not concerned with Pō-ka-'ī's past or her current situation, and he is willing to accept her and her child.\n– This reflects a cultural value in which relationships and family were highly valued, and people were often willing to form new relationships and create new families.\n\n• This paragraph also highlights the changing values and social norms during the 'Ai Kapu era.\n– Pua-li'i's willingness to accept Pō-ka-'ī and her child, and to form a new relationship with her, reflects a shift away from the strict social norms of the 'Ai Kapu era, in which social status and purity were highly valued.\n\n• The names of the characters also provide insight into their personalities and roles in the story.\n– Pua-li'i (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line) is described as a good man, and his name reflects his chiefly or noble status.\n– Pō-ka-'ī (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high chief') is a woman who has given birth to a child, and her name reflects her role as a mother and a woman. \n\n• The location of Ke-ahumoa (perhaps a heap of chickens or a place of many chickens) is also significant, as it reflects the rural or countryside setting of the story.\n– The fact that the couple relocates to Ke-ahumoa suggests that they are seeking a new life or a fresh start in a rural or natural setting. \n\n• The story also highlights the importance of relationships and family in Hawaiian culture.\n– The conversation between Pua-li'i and Pō-ka-'ī shows that relationships and family are highly valued, and that people are often willing to form new relationships and create new families.\n\n• The story also provides insight into the cultural and social norms of the 'Ai Kapu era.\n– The 'Ai Kapu era was a time of great change and upheaval in Hawaiian society, and the story reflects the shifting values and social norms of this time. \n\n• The use of the phrase \"e moe kāua\" (let's sleep together) also suggests a cultural practice in which relationships were formed through mutual agreement and consent.\n– This phrase reflects a cultural value in which relationships were based on mutual respect and agreement, rather than on strict social norms or expectations.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",

It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
