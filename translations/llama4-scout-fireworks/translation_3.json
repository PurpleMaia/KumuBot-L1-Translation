  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",
  "llama4-scout-fireworks_translation": "Here is the translation of the Hawaiian text to English, wrapped in <translation> </translation> tags:\n\n<translation>\nOn the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went to a canoe shed, where birds were chirping, and the sound of the hokeo bird was echoing. When they reached under the shade of that shed, Kauakahi sat apart with the hokeo bird. At that time, the canoe makers of Keawenuiaumi stopped at the base of the shed, and the birds, chirping, called out: \"Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, it's a rotten one. The canoe is no good, it's a rotten canoe. It's a canoe that will not go to sea.\"\n</translation>"
