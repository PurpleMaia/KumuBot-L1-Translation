  "llama4-scout-fireworks_translation": "Then 'Ama'u sent the ali'i from Waikīkī, four groups of warriors, and in one group there were eighty-eight kānaka in number, and so it was with all four groups. When they arrived at the school of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but there were no people. As they were about to leave, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out to them from above the ridgepole. They heard the voice, but they did not see a physical form, and they asked: \"Where are you from whom we are hearing this voice?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied: \"Here I am, above you.\" Eight kānaka climbed up, four on the back of the house and four on the front of the house, and they found Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said: \"Why have you come here?\" They replied: \"We have come to fight with Nāmakaokapāo'o, you small child, you are strong and a great warrior, you who killed your own father, Puali'i.\"",
  "llama4-scout-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

The story seems to revolve around the character of Nāmakaokapāo'o, who is depicted as a powerful and supernatural being. The passage sets the stage for a confrontation between Nāmakaokapāo'o and a group of warriors sent by 'Ama'u, an ali'i from Waikīkī. The narrative likely continues to unfold with a description of the encounter between Nāmakaokapāo'o and the warriors, and may provide insight into the cultural and historical context of ancient Hawaiian society. \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
