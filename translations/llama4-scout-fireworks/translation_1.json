  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair.",

Before eating, Pikoiakaalala said: “Listen to me, all of you, I have a law about eating, like this: “No talking, no making a sound, no bending (the head), no taking (food) with the fingers, no making a chewing sound, and my eating will be finished.” He took the pig, one bite, it was poi made from uala, one spoonful, and he swallowed, and took another bite, until almost all of the pig was gone, and all of the food in the umu was finished. One of the people said: “The food is for the gods.” This one was cut off. The siblings said: “Why did you cut him off, what was his offense?” “No, he was already full.” “Yes, we heard your law,” said the siblings. \nDuring this eating of Pikoiakaalala, his body grew and he became a big and good-looking man, but his hair remained mouse-like hair.\n</translation>"
