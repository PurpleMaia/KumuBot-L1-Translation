  "llama4-scout-fireworks_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard [about Nāmakaokapāo'o], he prepared eighteen war canoes and sailed under 'Ewa to do battle with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u and his people arrived in 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o was destroying everything, and there were no people left, and 'Ama'u was killed. The island of O'ahu was conquered by Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then, he took his mother and placed her on top of the land of O'ahu.",
  "llama4-scout-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\nWhen 'Ama'u heard [about Nāmakaokapāo'o], he prepared eighteen war canoes and sailed under 'Ewa to do battle with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u and his people arrived in 'Ewa, Nāmakaokapāo'o was destroying everything, and there were no people left, and 'Ama'u was killed. The island of O'ahu was conquered by Nāmakaokapāo'o, and then, he took his mother and placed her on top of the land of O'ahu.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n• This paragraph describes a significant event in the narrative, where 'Ama'u, likely a chief from another island, attempts to confront Nāmakaokapāo'o, but is ultimately killed. \n– The name 'A-ma'u (m) can be broken down into 'A- (prefix) and ma'u (taro), possibly signifying a connection to taro or agricultural abundance.\n– The number eighteen, 'umi-kumamā-walu, may hold cultural significance, as numbers often do in Hawaiian narratives, potentially representing completeness or a considerable quantity.\n\n• The passage highlights Nāmakaokapāo'o's destructive power and his conquest of the island of O'ahu.\n– Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions can be seen as a symbol of chaos and disorder, as he is described as destroying everything, leaving no people left ('a'ohe kanaka koe).\n– The killing of 'Ama'u and the conquest of O'ahu may signify a shift in power dynamics, with Nāmakaokapāo'o emerging as a dominant force.\n\n• The final action of Nāmakaokapāo'o, placing his mother on top of the land of O'ahu, may be seen as a symbolic claim of the land and a demonstration of his power and connection to his mother and the land.\n– This act could be interpreted as a form of spiritual or ceremonial claiming of the land, solidifying Nāmakaokapāo'o's connection to the island and his people.\n\n• This event may be seen as an allegory for the changes that occurred in Hawaiian society during the 'Ai Kapu era and the subsequent changes that followed.\n– Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions can be seen as a representation of the disruption of traditional power structures and the emergence of new forms of leadership and cultural practices.\n– The narrative may be hinting at the complexities and challenges of navigating cultural change and the consequences of actions taken during times of upheaval.",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
