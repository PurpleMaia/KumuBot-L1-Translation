  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",

He had a son with her, named Kahikiula. Makiioeoe left Kuaihelani and arrived in Kauai, where he met Hina. They lived together, and their son was born. One day, Makiioeoe left Kuaihelani again, bringing with him a message to Hina. He described the qualities of the daughter they were expecting. He said, “I am bringing you a child to be raised here. If she is born a son, give him my name; if she is born a daughter, give her the name of Laukiamanuikahiki. Raise her well and let her come to me, and here are the signs: a palaoa lei (a ceremonial necklace), a kupee (a flower garland), an ahuula (a coconut husker), a large canoe, a small canoe, a strong man, a weak man, a red color, black and red, the red color, a dark red, a strong red. Let her be protected and honored as Laukiamanuikahiki.” Makiioeoe then brought the daughter to Kuaihelani, along with the message of Laukiamanuikahiki, and all the gifts and provisions for her. She was protected and honored as Laukiamanuikahiki.” </translation>"
