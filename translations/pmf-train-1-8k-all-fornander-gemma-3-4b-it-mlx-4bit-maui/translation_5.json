  "reference_translation": "This call and reply was repeated twice before the guards heard it, when they sat up and listened to the call and they understood the meaning conveyed by the owl in its call. At this one of the guards said to his companion: “Say, this must be Laukiamanuikahiki, the king’s own daughter.” The other replied: “No, this cannot be the one, for she was to come in a red canoe having red sails, red paddles, red men, a large canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men; these I understand are the things that should accompany her; this girl on the other hand is a poor girl for she has come without any of these things.” The two again listened to the conversation between the owl and girl. After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter. They arrived at the home of Makiioeoe after midnight and roused him up saying: “Say, you wake up.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “There is an owl right over the pig house where the girl is held who called out to the girl in the following way:",

One says: “Oh, what is this girl like? Like Laukiamanuikahiki.” Another says: “No, it is not; her skin is red, her eyes are red, her hair is red, she is a red person, a big skin, a small skin, a very large skin, a big person, a small person, this is her appearance when she comes, not like this girl.” They listened again, to the words of the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki. “Let us work together, to speak about this.” One said: “Yes.” They stood before Makiioeoe and spoke about this. “What is this girl like?” asked Makiioeoe. “She is an owl, sitting very well on the branch of the tree where the girl is.” This is the word of the owl, and we have heard the call of the owl to the girl."
