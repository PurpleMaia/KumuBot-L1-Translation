  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",

Here is the reason for this: The mother then took her daughter and replied, “You are not of the flesh of the black earth, you are not of the black earth.” Pumaia then asked, “What two are troubling you?” “There is only death, and you are not of the black earth.” Pumaia then took her daughter: “Let us go; let me lead you.” They went from Pukoula to the slopes of Pauoa, and continued until they reached the waters of Alekoki, where they were met by Maemae. They then went on and traveled for a long time until the morning, when they arrived at Nuuanu.</translation>"
