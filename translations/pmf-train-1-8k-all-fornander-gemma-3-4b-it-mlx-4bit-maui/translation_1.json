  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair.",

Before this, Pikoiakaalala spoke: “You all must be silent; this is my rule for the eating: no singing, no laughing, no talking, no running, no shouting; all must be silent.” He then ate the pig and finished all the food in the pot. One man said: “This is a gift from God.” It was true. Another man asked: “Why did you make this rule for eating?” “Because I am full of life,” replied the man. In this feast, Pikoiakaalala’s body became large and good, his hair grew long and turned into a black hair. </translation>"
