  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair.",

He said, “Everyone, please be quiet, this is my reason for being sick: no singing, no dancing, no eating, no drinking, no joking.” He then treated the pig and all the food that was cooked in the oven. One person asked, “This is a blessing from the gods.” And it was true. Another elder said, “How did you know?” “No, we have heard your rule.” During this illness of Pikoiakaalala, his body became weak and he transformed into a great and good man, with a black head and an iole (a type of fern) hair.</translation>"
