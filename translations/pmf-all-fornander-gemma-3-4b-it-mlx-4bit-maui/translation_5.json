  "reference_translation": "This call and reply was repeated twice before the guards heard it, when they sat up and listened to the call and they understood the meaning conveyed by the owl in its call. At this one of the guards said to his companion: “Say, this must be Laukiamanuikahiki, the king’s own daughter.” The other replied: “No, this cannot be the one, for she was to come in a red canoe having red sails, red paddles, red men, a large canoe, a small canoe, large men and small men; these I understand are the things that should accompany her; this girl on the other hand is a poor girl for she has come without any of these things.” The two again listened to the conversation between the owl and girl. After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter.

One says: “Listen, what is this for the girl? For Laukiamanuikahiki.” Another says: “No, it is not; its skin is red, its skin is dark, its skin is long, a large man, a small man, it’s that kind of appearance he has, not this girl.” They listen again, to the language of the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki. “Let them work together, to speak about this.” One says: “Yes.” They stand before Makiioeoe, and he explains: “This is what you should do.” “What?” asks Makiioeoe. “It’s an owl, it’s resting peacefully on the branch where the girl is. This is the language of the owl, and you have heard its call to the girl.”</translation>"
