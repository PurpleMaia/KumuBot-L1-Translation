  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",

He came from Kuaihelani to Kauai, guided by Hina. When Makiioeoe arrived in Kauai, he spoke to Hina: “I am here; if you give birth to a son, you shall bear my name. If you give birth to a daughter, you shall bear the name of Laukiamanuikahiki. You will be raised and made great, and you will come to me, and here are my signs: a feather lei, a flower garland, a mat, a large cloth, a small cloth, a great man, a small man, a red cloth, a black cloth, a purple cloth, a blue cloth, a purple man.” Makiioeoe then told the chiefs about the appearance of the girl and provided all things for Laukiamanuikahiki, both plentiful and precious, protected and honored. </translation>"
