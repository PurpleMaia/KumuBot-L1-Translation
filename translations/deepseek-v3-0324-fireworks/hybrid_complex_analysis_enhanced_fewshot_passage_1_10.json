At that time, 'Ama'u, a chief of this O'ahu, was staying at Waikīkī where he resided. A man from Honouliuli came and arrived at Waikīkī where the chief was staying. He announced: 'O chief! There is an extremely strong little boy whose father has died, and his head was thrown far out to sea, a very long distance, five miles long.' When 'Ama'u heard this, he thought: 'With his strength, I could die by him, but if I don't die by him, then he has no strength.' As he was speaking at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o heard these words about himself.\"",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",

Honorific address (\"E ke ali'i ē!\")  \n      2. Extraordinary claim (strong child)  \n      3. Verifiable detail (5-mile displacement)  \n    ◦ Echoes *'ōlelo no'eau*: *\"I ulu no ka lālā i ke kumu\"* (The branch grows because of the trunk) → strength stems from lineage  \n\n• **Allegorical Reading:**  \n  – The thrown head symbolizes:  \n    ◦ Breaking *'Ai Kapu* restrictions (cephalic rituals were kapu)  \n    ◦ Environmental commentary: Head→*pōhaku* (stone) metaphor for land displacement during sandalwood trade era  \n  – 'Ama'u's dichotomy (\"I die by him\"/\"he's powerless\") mirrors:  \n    ◦ *\"Pō ka lā, ao ka pō.\"* (Night becomes day becomes night) → cyclical power dynamics  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
