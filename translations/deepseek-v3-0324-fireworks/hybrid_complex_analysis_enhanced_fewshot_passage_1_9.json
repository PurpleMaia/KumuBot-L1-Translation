The severed head of Puali'i responded to Nāmakaokapāo'o: \"Farewell to you, Nāmakaokapāo'o.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o grabbed Puali'i's head and threw it into the sea at Waipōuli, a cave along the shore of Honouliuli—its length being five miles long.",

Key symbolic elements deserve close analysis:\n\n– **Ritual Context of Beheading:** \n   The sequence begins with Nāmakaokapāo'o concluding prayer (pule), suggesting this act occurs within a sacred framework. In 'Ai Kapu traditions, beheading (moku ke po'o) often symbolized the transfer of mana or the severing of oppressive systems. Puali'i's attempt to strike with a ko'i (adze)—a tool used in creation/destruction duality—backfires allegorically, representing the overthrow of outdated authority.\n\n– **Talking Head Motif (Po'o 'Ōlelo):** \n   The animate disembodied head is a powerful motif in Polynesian narratives (cf. the story of Kū-ali'i). Puali'i's head bidding farewell suggests:\n   a) The persistence of ancestor communication ('ūmaiā) \n   b) A cultural acknowledgment of cyclic death/rebirth (cf. the cave as womb symbol, analyzed below)\n   The greeting \"Aloha 'oe\" from a severed head merges the concepts of aloha (compassion) and make (death), embodying Hawaiian spiritual paradox.\n\n– **Geographic Symbolism:**\n   Waipōuli (Dark-Water) and Honouliuli (Dark-Bay) contain layered meanings:\n   • Waipōuli's cave length (5 miles) numerically references the Hawaiian cosmological number for transformation (cf. 5 elements in creation chants)\n   • The watery destination (kai) signifies a return to primordial chaos (Kumulipo imagery), appropriate for recycling a punitive figure like Puali'i\n\n– **Etymological Resonance:**\n   Nāmakaokapāo'o's name (Eyes-of-the-pāo'o-fish) gains new significance here. The pāo'o fish (a blind goby) symbolizes:\n   a) Hidden wisdom (inability to see physical world but perceive spiritual truths) \n   b) Adaptation (pāo'o species survive in both saltwater and freshwater)—paralleling the protagonist's fluid navigation between physical and supernatural realms\n\n• **Structural Analysis:**\n  This passage exemplifies the Hawaiian narrative pattern of: \n  1) Ritual preparation (pule)\n  2) Failed violent act (ko'i stroke) \n  3) Supernatural inversion (animate head)\n  4) Geographic resolution (ocean deposition)\n  This structure mirrors the classic four-phase Hawaiian ritual sequence observed in heiau ceremonies.\n\n• **Cultural Transition Symbolism:**\n  The beheading scene metaphorically represents:\n  – The end of Puali'i's 'Ai Kapu mentality (his head literally separated from body/mind duality)\n  – Nāmakaokapāo'o's progressive ideology physically discarding the old order (throwing head to sea)\n  – The cave's five-mile length may numerically encode the five generations needed for societal change in Hawaiian oral histories",

  "reference_translation": "When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength."
