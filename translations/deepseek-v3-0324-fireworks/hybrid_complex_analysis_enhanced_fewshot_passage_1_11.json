  "deepseek-v3-0324-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "<translation>\n\"Then, he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. After the mother was concealed, he returned to their home at Keahumoa and settled there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the ridgepole of the house, removed the grass thatching from the back and front, and lay down right atop the ridgepole in between.\"\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 11:**\n• This passage reveals important cultural and symbolic actions in the narrative:\n– First, the protagonist **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o** relocates his mother to **Wai-pouli** (dark/dusky water), a cave likely symbolizing protection, concealment, and perhaps ancestral connection (caves being important burial sites and spaces of spiritual significance in Hawaiian tradition)\n– The verb **hūnā** (to hide/conceal) carries ritual weight, suggesting this isn't mere physical concealment but preparation for transformation or protection from kapu violations\n\n• Architectural symbolism:\n– **Kaupoku** (ridgepole) represents the spine/centerline of Hawaiian hale (house) architecture, loaded with meaning:\n   - Physically: The structural axis uniting front (alo) and back (kua) of house\n   - Spiritually: The axis between human and divine realms (cf. Beckwith's analysis of house symbolism)\n– His removal of **mau'u** (thatching grass) from both sides (kua/alo) before lying on the bare ridgepole suggests:\n   - Exposure of structural truths\n   - A literal and metaphorical \"lying at the center\" of domestic space\n   - Possible allegory for dismantling the 'Ai Kapu system by revealing its structural core\n\n• The sequence follows classic Hawaiian narrative logic:\n– Action-consequence rhythm (hiding mother → architectural exposure)\n– Spatial progression (cave → home → roof position)\n– Binary symmetry (back/front thatching removal) very characteristic of Hawaiian poetic structure\n\n• Name analysis:\n– **Wai-pouli**: Broken as Wai (water) + pouli (darkness/obscurity), referencing both physical cave properties and potential symbolic transition states\n– **Ke-ahu-moa**: Literally \"the chicken altar\", suggesting this home location retains sacrificial connotations that contrast with Nāmakaokapāo'o's actions\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
