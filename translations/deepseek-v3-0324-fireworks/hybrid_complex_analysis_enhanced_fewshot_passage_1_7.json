All the other children saw and ran to stand at a distant place out of fear of Puali'i. Puali'i said to Nāmakaokapāo'o: \"Hey! Here is the machete in my hand, which will cut off your head today, and when your head is severed, then roasted with the sweet potatoes, I will eat first, and then it will be free.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o paid no attention to these words of Puali'i, so Puali'i spoke again, this being the second time. Puali'i prepared to cut Nāmakaokapāo'o with the machete, and at that moment Nāmakaokapāo'o prayed his death prayer against Puali'i. The prayer went like this:  \n*\"Alas the eye of my little pāo'o,*  \n*Gathering, hardening,*  \n*Whether to eat or leave,*  \n*Or leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani,*  \n*That is Kukui‘aimakaokalani,*  \n*This is my dear companion,*  \n*Nāmakaokai‘a, great chief of Hawai‘i,*  \n*Slip away, slip away the worthless breath,*  \n*Men with spears,*  \n*Spears with shields,*  \n*Death comes to Nāmakaokapāo'o.\"*",
  "deepseek-v3-0324-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**\n• This passage showcases a critical confrontation between Pua-li'i (stepfather) and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (stepson), steeped in cultural symbolism and esoteric meaning:  \n– Pua-li'i's threat to behead Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o and roast his head with sweet potatoes (*kālua*) mirrors ‘Ai Kapu-era practices where sacrificial offerings were cooked in imu (earth ovens). The phrase \"*a ‘ai iho a‘u ma mua, a laila, noa*\" (\"I will eat first, then it will be free\") reflects the ‘Ai Kapu protocol where the highest-ranking individual ate first to render the food *noa* (free from restriction).  \n– The machete (*ko‘ilipi*) symbolizes judicial authority and punitive violence, aligning with Pua-li'i’s role as an enforcer of traditional order. His threat inverts sacrificial norms—where ulua fish replaced humans—by proposing human sacrifice *for* food (sweet potato), a subversion of ‘Ai Kapu logic.  \n\n• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s resistance is passive yet potent:  \n– His disregard for Pua-li'i’s threats (*‘a‘ohe ho‘olohe*) suggests defiance of patriarchal authority, a theme recurring in Hawaiian mo‘olelo (histories) where youth challenge outdated customs.  \n– His *pule make* (death prayer) is a poetic invocation of divine justice. The prayer’s structure follows traditional *oli kānaenae* (ritual chants), employing:  \n  * Repetition (\"e waiho paha\" / \"e he‘e lā\") for rhythmic emphasis.  \n  * Name symbolism: Nā-kukui-‘ai-maka-o-ka-lani (\"The-lights-that-feed-the-eyes-of-the-heavens\") and Kukui-‘ai-maka-o-ka-lani may reference ancestral protection or celestial observers.  \n  * Wordplay: *pāo‘o* (his name’s suffix) phonetically resembles *po‘o* (\"head\"), tying to the beheading threat.  \n\n• The final line’s paradoxical declaration—\"*Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o*\"—serves as a **kilio‘o** (prophetic twist):  \n– Literally, it predicts Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s death, but allegorically foreshadows Pua-li'i’s demise, as later passages confirm. This reflects the Hawaiian concept of *kāpāwale* (hidden meanings in chants).  \n– The chant’s reference to *ihe* (spears) and *pahu* (shields) militarizes the conflict, framing it as a battle between generational worldviews—‘Ai Kapu traditionalism (Pua-li'i) vs. post-contact adaptation (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o).  \n\n• Cultural Context:  \n– The sweet potato (*‘uala*) is not just food but a metaphor for fertility and lineage. Its destruction earlier (described in preceding paragraphs) and ritual use here symbolize the disruption and renewal of societal norms.  \n– The children’s flight (*holo akula... no ka maka‘u*) mirrors historical accounts of commoners avoiding chiefly disputes, emphasizing the scene’s gravity.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
