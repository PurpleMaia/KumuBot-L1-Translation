  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo.",

After this condition, his body became extremely large and heavy, and it remained so for the sake of the house of Halauoloolo. From the mountainside, almost to the sea, his body was extremely large and heavy, and it remained that way for the sake of the house of Halauoloolo.</translation>"
