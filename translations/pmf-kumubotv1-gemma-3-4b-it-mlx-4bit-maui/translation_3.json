  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",

They retreated beneath the source of that strength, becoming isolated from the rest. That day, Keawenuiaumi discovered the source of their power, and the birds cried out: “O Keawenuiaumi! There is no strength, only weakness. It’s a bad strength, a weak strength. It won't reach the ocean.”</translation>"
