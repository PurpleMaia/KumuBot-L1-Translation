  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",

Here is the reason for this: The mother took the girl and replied: “You, oh, spirit of the black earth, you are not your father’s spirit of the black earth.” Pumaia asked: “What is it that you are seeking?” “Nothing, only to be brought to the realm of death, you are not your father’s spirit of the black earth.” Pumaia took the woman and said: “Let us go; let him remove me and carry me.” They went from Pukoula to the cliffs of Pauoa, where they continued until the water of Alekoki, and then to Maemae, by which time they had traveled a long distance through the night, until they arrived at Nuuanu.</translation>"
