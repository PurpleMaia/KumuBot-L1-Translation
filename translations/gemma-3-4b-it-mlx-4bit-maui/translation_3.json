  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",
  "gemma-3-4b-it-mlx-4bit-maui_translation": "<translation>For the second time under the sun of them in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele were in a place of great strength, and the birds flew where they would. They rested beneath the source of that great strength, secluded as Kauakahi was, with a lament. That day, the people lamented Keawenuiaumi’s journey to the source of strength, calling out: “Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no wind, it’s weak. It's a bad wind, a weak wind. It cannot reach the sea.”</translation>"
