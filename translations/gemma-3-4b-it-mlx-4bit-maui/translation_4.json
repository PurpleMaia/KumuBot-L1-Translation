  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",

The mother then took the girl and replied: “You, oh, a spirit of the black earth, you are not your father’s black earth.” Pumaia then asked: “What two are troubling you?” “No, only death is present so that you may be black earth.” Pumaia then took the woman: “Let us go; free me and carry her.” They followed from Pukoula to the slopes of Pauoa, going until the waters of Alekoki, where they met Maemae, and then they followed them as they traveled through a long night, until Nuuanu.</translation>"
