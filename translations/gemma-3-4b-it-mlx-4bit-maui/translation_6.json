  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",
  "gemma-3-4b-it-mlx-4bit-maui_translation": "<translation>This is a recounting of a significant event, linked to the goddess Hina. It speaks of Makiioeoe, whose lineage traced back to Kuaihelani, and his journey from Kuaihelani to Kauai, where he met Hina. They joined together, and a child was born. On that day, Makiioeoe left Kuaihelani, speaking to Hina about the desired qualities of the future child. He described gifts – a feather lei, a woven mat, a tapa cloth, a large and small basket, a tall and short man, red earth, black earth, a crimson cloth, a dark crimson cloth, and a red-skinned person. He then sent the child back to Kuaihelani, accompanied by gifts for Laukiamanuikahiki. All things were kept sacred and permitted to Laukiamanuikahiki, both large and small.</translation>"
