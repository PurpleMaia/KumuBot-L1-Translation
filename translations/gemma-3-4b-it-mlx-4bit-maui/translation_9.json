  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession.",
  "gemma-3-4b-it-mlx-4bit-maui_translation": "Here's a translation of the Hawaiian text, aiming to capture both literal meaning and cultural context:\n\n<translation>\nThis is a lament for the land of Kauai, recounting its history and mourning its loss. It speaks of Waiakea flowing to Hilo, referencing Halepaki as a respected elder and Wailea as a revered mother. It describes Wailea as a native of Kauai, and Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, who died in Kohala.  The text details a large birth from Kaipalaoa, and his elder traveling to Kauai, ultimately dying as Kalanialiiloa. Finally, it mentions Pueonuiokona, a revered elder of Kauai.  The entire passage is filled with references to the land and its sacredness, emphasizing a deep connection to the earth and a lament for those who have passed on. It’s a poignant reflection on lineage, loss, and the importance of the land to the people. </translation>\n\n**Important Notes on Translation:**\n\n*   **Context is Crucial:** Hawaiian texts, especially laments (mo’olelo), are deeply rooted in cultural context. A literal word-for-word translation would miss the emotional weight and significance.\n*   **Abstract Concepts:** Many terms refer to abstract concepts (like ‘lii’ – a revered elder, or the land itself) that don't have direct English equivalents.\n*   **Flow and Rhythm:** The original text has a specific rhythm and flow that’s difficult to replicate perfectly in English. I've focused on conveying the overall meaning and spirit.\n*   **’Lii’:**  The term ‘lii’ is a complex one, referring to someone highly respected, often due to their wisdom, lineage, or role in the community. It's more than just a \"leader.\"\n\nIf you need a translation focused on specific elements (e.g., a particular name or event), please let me know, and I can refine the translation further."
