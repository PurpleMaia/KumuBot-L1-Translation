  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nNamakaokapāoʻo said: \"I know, I am indeed a great man, and I have come to Koʻolau, and I am the one they speak of.\" They replied: \"No, it is you, as we have heard, therefore you will kill us, you will not survive.\" Namakaokapāoʻo said: \"Let us all go down to fight.\" When they reached below, Namakaokapāoʻo fought fiercely, killing them all except one man who fled to Waikīkī and informed ʻAmaʻu of their complete demise, becoming the sole witness for ʻAmaʻu to hear of their fate.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\nThis passage is part of a larger mythological or historical narrative involving Namakaokapāoʻo, a figure often associated with Pele (the Hawaiian deity of volcanoes) in oral traditions. The text reflects themes of prophetic conflict, the inevitability of fate, and the role of witnesses in preserving oral history. The geographic references to Koʻolau (a windward region) and Waikīkī (on Oʻahu) anchor the story in the Hawaiian landscape. Linguistically, the dialogue showcases classical Hawaiian syntax and honorific speech patterns, while the narrative structure—featuring direct speech, action, and resolution—mirrors traditional storytelling methods used to transmit cultural values and historical memory.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
