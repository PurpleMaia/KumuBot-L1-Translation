  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_translation": "\n\n<translation> Makiioeoe was the father, and Hina was the mother (Kuaihelani was Makiioeoe’s land, the chief there, a woman who lived in Kuaihelani, one child with that woman, named Kahikiula). Hina was from Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was found. Makiioeoe came from Kuaihelani and met Hina in Kauai; they slept together, and Hina became pregnant. At that time, Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani and said to Hina: \"Behold, I am returning. Stay until you give birth: if the child is a boy, name him with my name; if a girl, name her Laukiamanuikahiki. When she grows up and wishes to go searching for me, here are the signs: a whalebone lei, a comb, a red cloak, a large canoe, a small canoe, many people, few people, a red canoe, a red gourd, red cloth, red objects, red-skinned people.\" Makiioeoe then returned to Kuaihelani, instructing the guardians about the girl’s appearance and planting all things for Laukiamanuikahiki—precious and ordinary items alike—declaring her both sacred and common. </translation>"
