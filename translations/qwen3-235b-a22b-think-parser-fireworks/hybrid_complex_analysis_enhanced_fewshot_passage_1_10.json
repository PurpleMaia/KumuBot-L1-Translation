  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \n\"A death came upon Puali‘i, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘i, and stayed with her. Nāmakaokapāo‘o ate nothing. At that time, ‘Ama‘u reigned as chief of O‘ahu, dwelling in Waikīkī. A messenger came from Honouliuli to Waikīkī, where the chief was staying, and reported: 'O Chief! There is an incredibly strong little child whose father has died and whose head was abandoned in a very long stretch of sea, five miles in length.

While the chief was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard these words about himself.\"  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n**Paragraph 10:**• The narrative shifts focus to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s lineage and the political landscape. Puali‘i’s death creates an opening for the boy to return to his mother Pō-ka-‘ī, reinforcing the mother-child bond central to Hawaiian kinship (ko‘olauwā). Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s refusal to eat may symbolize grief or a ritual fast, a practice rooted in Hawaiian mourning traditions where kin abstained from food to honor the dead (Pukui, *Nānā i ke Kumu*).  \n\n– **New character: ‘A-ma‘u** (perhaps “the one who listens/ponders”) is introduced as ruling O‘ahu from Waikīkī, a historic seat of power. His portrayal aligns with pre-unification *ali‘i* rivalries, where chiefs vied for dominance across moku (islands). The messenger from Honouliuli (already noted in paragraph 3 as a site tied to Puali‘i) reinforces geographic continuity.  \n\n– The messenger’s warning about a “strong child” mirrors earlier motifs of prodigious strength (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s prodigiousness) but adds a tragic backstory: the child’s father died, and his head was cast into a “five-mile-long sea” (*wahi lō‘ihi loa*). In Hawaiian symbolism, the ocean (kai) often represents spiritual liminality or divine judgment (Pukui’s *ka lani kai*). This imagery evokes both vulnerability (abandonment of the child’s father) and transformation (seas as a transition between realms).  \n\n– ‘Ama‘u’s oscillation between violence and restraint reflects *‘ai kapu* diplomacy: ancient chiefs balanced warlike tendencies (*he ali‘i ‘ai kahiko*, chieftains of old) with *pono* (righteousness). His assumption that the child lacks *ikaika* (strength/support) due to no *‘onā* (allies) underscores the *ali‘i* emphasis on pedigree. However, this contrasts with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s mythic status as a *kanaka maoli* (native being) whose power stems not from lineage but dari (divine birthright/cosmic alignment).  \n\n– Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s eavesdropping in Waikīkī marks his first known journey to O‘ahu, signaling a narrative expansion beyond Kaua‘i. This reflects broader Polynesian oral traditions where heroes traverse archipelagos to confront threats (e.g., Māui’s voyaging). The allusions to head-to-sea abandonment and five-mile symbolism may encode esoteric knowledge: in *mo‘olelo Hawai‘i*, the number five (*lima*) and sea distances often denote sacred cycles (e.g., *lani-lima*, the five heavens above). The head (*po‘o*) thrown seaward could symbolize the dissolution of old *kapu* (taboos) into the oceanic realm, a space of both destruction and rebirth.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
