It happened that a certain chief, ‘Ama‘u of O‘ahu, lived at Waikīkī. A man came from Honouliuli to where the chief was staying and said: \"O great chief! There is an incredibly strong little boy whose father has died. His father's head was carried far out to sea, a very long distance five miles away. When the chief ‘Ama‘u heard these words, he said, ‘That is my strength—if I kill him. But I will not kill him for he has no strength of his own.’ While he was speaking at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these very words about himself.",

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nThen Puali‘i died, so Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘i, and they lived together. Nāmakaokapāo‘o ate no food during that time. It happened that a certain chief, ‘Ama‘u of O‘ahu, lived at Waikīkī. A man came from Honouliuli to where the chief was staying and said: \"O great chief! There is an incredibly strong little boy whose father has died. His father's head was carried far out to sea, a very long distance five miles away.

But I will not kill him for he has no strength of his own.’ While he was speaking at Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard these very words about himself.\n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 10:**  \n• **Death of the antagonist as narrative catalyst:**  \n– Puali‘i’s demise removes a source of conflict, allowing Nāmakaokapāo‘o to reunite with his mother, Pō-ka-‘ī (“night descends upon the chief”). This reunion emphasizes *mālama ‘ohana* (family care) but also highlights the boy’s isolation (*“ua make kona makua kāne”*), setting up his later heroic trials.  \n• **Cultural norms of mourning and fasting:**  \n– Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s refusal to eat mirrors *ho‘omaha* (deep grief), a documented Hawaiian practice where a *mo‘opuna* (grandchild) or close kin might abstain from food for days after a primary mourner’s death. This contrasts with Puali‘i’s prior threat to consume the boy, conflating literal and symbolic consumption.  \n\n• **Introduction of ‘Ama‘u as foil to Nāmakaokapāo‘o:**  \n– ‘A-ma-‘u (“the one who guides by the hand”) is positioned as a rival ruler in Waikīkī, a historically sacred district (*heiau* site) for Oahu chiefs. His proclamation about a “strong boy” whose father’s head washed five miles out to sea evokes the *mo‘olelo* motif of *kānaka ‘ō‘ī* (inferior challengers tested against protagonists).  \n– The five-mile sea distance (*“he wahi lō‘ihi loa, ‘elima mile”*) may symbolize the demarcation of *kapu* zones. In the ‘Ai Kapu era, chiefs’ remains were often taken far from shore to prevent desecration, a practice echoed here.  \n\n• **Symbolism of auditory confrontation:**  \n– Nāmakaokapāo‘o “hearing” (*“ua lohe”*) ‘Ama‘u’s taunts marks his awakening as a *mo‘o kāne* (hero). Sound (*elo, leo*) was sacred in Hawaiian cosmology, linked to *kanikau* (lamentation) and *hō‘ike* (public declaration of prowess). This episode mirrors the prophet Elijah hearing Yahweh’s “still small voice” in 1 Kings 19:12, reflecting pan-Polynesian themes of divine or heroic self-discovery through a calling.  \n\n• **Etymological layers of ‘Ama‘u’s challenge:**  \n– “I ka mākou āina” (*“we two as food”* in prior context) conflates consumption with conquest. ‘Ama‘u claims he lacks *ikaika* (strength/divine power) to kill Nāmakaokapāo‘o, but his rhetoric tests the boy’s ability to transcend inherited shame (*“ua make kona makua kāne”*), a common theme in Polynesian *apotheosis* stories. His name ‘A-ma-‘u (“guide by the hand of *ma‘u* [permanence]”) implies rigid adherence to old ways, contrasting Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s transformative energy.  \n\n• **Allegorical tension between ‘Ai Kapu and post-‘Ai Kapu ethics:**  \n– The abandoned father’s head drifting five miles symbolizes the rejection of ancestral ties (*ʻaumākua*) under ‘Ai Kapu. Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a demigod born outside lineal succession (his parentage is mixed divine and mortal), represents a new order where power (*mana*) derives from individual merit rather than patrilineal decay (head-in-the-sea imagery). ‘Ama‘u’s impotence (“no strength of his own”) allegorizes the demise of bloodline-based *ali‘i* authority, a post–1779 shift in Hawaiian governance.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
