  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”",

When they arrived below the trunk of this koa, Kauakahi remained behind with the canoe log. At that time, the canoe carvers of Keawenuiaumi were at the trunk of the koa, the birds alighted, shouting: “O, Keawenuiaumi! No canoe, it’s a gourd. A bad canoe, a gourd. A canoe that cannot reach the sea.”</translation>"
