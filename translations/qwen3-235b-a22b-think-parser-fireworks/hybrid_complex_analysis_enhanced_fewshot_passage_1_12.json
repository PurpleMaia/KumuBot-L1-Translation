Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nHe chief 'Ama'u from Waikīkī sent four combatants, among them a group of eighteen warriors. They numbered forty in total. They arrived at the plains of Keahumoa, entered the house, but found no people there. They prepared to depart when Nāmakaokapāo'o shouted from above. Hearing his voice but seeing no body, they asked, \"Who is that speaking?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o replied, \"I am here above.\" Eight men then climbed up—four on the back of the house, four on the front—and captured Nāmakaokapāo'o. He asked them, \"What is your reason for coming here?\" They answered, \"We come here to make war against Nāmakaokapāo'o, a mighty and brave child who defeated his stepfather, Puali'i.\"\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\n**Paragraph 12:**  \n• The chief's name, **'A-ma'u** (perhaps \"the silent one\" or \"he who is held back\"), signals a force opposing Nāmakaokapāo'o, contrasting with the hero's boldness. His origin at **Wai-kīkī** (\"freshwater spilling\")—a historically significant site in O'ahu—grounds the story in real geography and aligns with its use as a meeting ground for chiefs in traditional narratives.  \n– The **numerology** here is cryptic yet symbolically rich:  \n–– The **four combatants** (po'e kaua) may represent cardinal directions, mana (spiritual power) divisions, or the four major Hawaiian islands.  \n–– The **group of eighteen** (kanahā kumamāwalu) and **total of forty** (kanahā) evoke cyclical timekeeping (e.g., the 40-day *wā mahealani* lunar phase) or sacred numerical codes, often tied to Hawaiian cosmology (Pukui's *Anahonua* schema).  \n• The warriors' arrival at **Ke-a-hu-moa** (\"heap of chickens,\" a real location near Wahiawa) mirrors earlier motifs where this area signifies transitional spaces between human and divine realms. Their intrusion into **an empty house** (hale) reflects pre-battle testing of resolve, a practice seen in *mo'olelo po'ele* (dark tales) to assess opponents' vulnerability.  \n• Nāmakaokapāo'o's disembodied voice **from above** (luna o kaupoku) evokes deified status, recalling stories of *naio* (protectors of land or bloodline) speaking from mountains/altars. His defiance (\"**I am here above**\") contrasts with the warriors' physical search, symbolizing spiritual vs. material strength.  \n• The warriors' demand to fight a **\"mighty child\" who defeated his stepfather, Puali'i**, revisits the theme of generational conflict introduced earlier. Puali'i's grievance against Nāmakaokapāo'o now becomes a rallying cry for external forces, suggesting allegory for cultural or political threats (e.g., foreign invasion or rebellion against 'Ai Kapu hierarchies).  \n– Notably, the **capture of Nāmakaokapāo'o by eight men** (four front/back) mirrors the *pōkā* (\"to surround\") tactic in Hawaiian warfare, codified in council texts like *Ka'ao o Kānaloa*. The group's organized ascent—climbing sacred architecture's cardinal axes—frames the struggle as a ritualized challenge to his divine right.  \n• The phrase \"**he ikaika a me ke koa loa**\" (\"extremely strong and brave\") echoes Epeli Hau'ofa’s \"oceanic\" hero archetype, linking physical might to ancestral resilience. This foreshadows a clash between localized mana (embodied in Nāmakaokapāo'o) and external authority (embodied in 'Ama'u's warriors), a recurring tension in post-'Ai Kapu transition narratives.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
