They answered, 'We have come to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a small yet mighty and valiant child, who killed his stepfather Puali'i.'\"  \n</translation>  \n\n**COMMENTARY**  \n### Paragraph 12:  \n• The narrative escalates the conflict by introducing **'Ama'u** (lit. \"the dragging dark one\" – 'ama'u = drag/heaviness + 'u'umed darkness), a chief from **Waikīkī** (lit. \"spouting waters\"), a historically significant coastal area in O'ahu tied to royal power and warfare. This situates the story within broader pan-Hawaiian motifs, as Waikīkī was a stronghold for aliʻi and a cultural crossroads.  \n• The army composition – 4 warrior leaders with 18 followers each (total 72 people) – reflects deliberate structure. The number 18 (**kanahā kumamāwalu**: 10 + 8) may symbolize completeness (8) paired with foundational authority (10), while 72 (4x18) could allegorically represent widespread social mobilization against the protagonist.  \n• The **empty house** encountered by the warriors ('aʻohe kanaka = \"no people\") contrasts starkly with their large contingent. This absence may signal divine intervention (e.g., ancestral spirits withholding support) or a tactical maneuver by Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s allies to isolate the confrontation, emphasizing his singular destiny as ʻa child whose voice commands truth from above.  \n• Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s declaration **\"Eia nō wau i luna nei\"** (\"It is I, here above\") carries symbolic weight:  \n  – The **roof** (papaku hale) represents spiritual authority in Hawaiian cosmology, as ancestors were believed to dwell \"above\" in pō and speak through akua. His elevated position may invert traditional hierarchies, positioning him as a divine spokesperson critiquing human leadership.  \n  – The warriors’ inability to see his body despite hearing his voice ('aʻohe he ʻike ʻia o ke kino = \"no one could see his body\") echoes kahiko creation myths where godly forms are invisible to mortal eyes until revealed through ritual. This ambiguity reinforces his demigod identity (from Paragraph 1’s commentary) and foreshadows supernatural intervention.  \n• The arrest choreography – **8 climbers (4 on the back, 4 on the front)** – references traditional Hawaiian military strategy (\"encircle from multiple directions\") but also encodes numerological symbolism:  \n  – 8 (**walu**) was sacred to Kanaloa, god of the deep sea and warfare. Pairing this with the number 4 (directions, elements) suggests the warriors are channeling chaotic, god-adjacent forces in their attempt to subdue him.  \n  – The bifurcated assault (back/front) mirrors dualistic tensions in the text: old vs. new (stepfather Pualiʻi’s death vs. Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s rise), land vs. sea (Keahumoa’s plains vs. Honouliuli’s coastal setting), and the collapse of ‘Ai Kapu’s rigid hierarchies (Paragraph 3: Pualiʻi’s threatened cannibalism).  \n• The warriors explicitly link Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s reputation to **Pualiʻi’s demise**, closing the narrative loop from Paragraph 6’s violent threat (\"poʻo ona me nā maka ka mea e ʻīnaʻi ai kauʻuala\"). Now, Pualiʻi’s death is framed as a catalyst (\"nāna nō i pepehi i kona makua kāne\") for mobilizing external chiefs, suggesting Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s actions are destabilizing traditional power structures beyond his household.  \n• This paragraph’s tension between overwhelming numbers (72 warriors) and Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s isolated defiance foreshadows **revolutions against ‘Ai Kapu** (e.g., Liholiho’s abolition in 1819). His capture here becomes a temporary setback – a ritualistic \"death\" before eventual triumph over the old order. The use of \"kaua\" (war, battle) instead of \"hoʻoneʻe\" (conflict) underscores the systemic nature of the struggle, as kaua often involved formal challenges between aliʻi lineages.",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
