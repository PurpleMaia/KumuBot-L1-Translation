  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nNamakaokapāo‘o was a long-awaited child, a very strong youth in her youth. There was none her equal in bravery across these islands from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau. Her father was Kauluakaha‘i, a man from Kahikipapaialewa, a land in Kahikinu‘u. Her mother was Poka‘i. Her father was a great chief of Kahikipapaialewa, and he had a divine guardian spirit (ao‘ao akua) at his side.\n</translation>\n\n---\n\ncommentary\nThe passage introduces the ocean deity Namakaokapā‘o (often Namaka in Hawaiian mythology) with literary flourish, embedding genealogical, spiritual, and geographic elements critical to understanding pre-colonial Hawaiian worldview.\n\n1. **Cultural Context**:\n   - Namakaokapā‘o (Namaka with the war club/rainbow) embodies *kanaloa* (life force of the ocean) and is a granddaughter of Haumea. Her \"great strength\" (*nika ikaika loa*) and unmatched bravery (*he ‘ao‘ao akua*) reflect Hawaiian ideals of *pilipili* (determination) and *mākā* (warrior spirit). \n   - The geographic reference (from Hawai‘i Island to Ni‘ihau) underscores her pan-insular significance, aligning with chants like the *Kumulipo* that document deities across the archipelago. Her parents’ names—Kauluakaha‘i (Kaulua with the food god) and Poka‘i (Little Pocket/guardian)—hint at their roles in spiritual sustenance and protection.\n   - The *ao‘ao akua (divine assistant) reflects the hierarchical *akua-to-ali‘i* relationship: high chiefs like Kauluakaha‘i operated with the aid of guardian spirits, mirroring the *kāula* (prophet)-*ali‘i* dynamic in Hawaiian governance.\n\n2. **Linguistic Features**:\n   - **Name Etymology**: \"Namakaokapāo‘o\" combines *namaka* (sea), *o* (possessive), *kapāo‘o* (war club/spear or metaphor for strength), anchoring her identity in martial/elemental power.\n   - **Genealogical Syntax**: The structure “He keiki… a he keiki…” (The child… a child who…) follows *ka‘ao* (genealogical narrative) conventions, elevating her status.\n   - **Metaphoric Precision**: *Hiku ‘u‘uku* (long-awaited) and *ikaika loa* (very strong) use *loa* (“long”/“intense”) to amplify her mythic stature. \n   - **Place-Name Symbolism**: Kahikipapaialewa (“The Land Where the Sky is Turned Upside Down”) in Kahikinu‘u (“The Land of Constant Crashing Waves”) locates her lineage in dynamic, near-mythic environments, reflecting her oceanic power.\n\n3. **Historical Significance**:\n   - **Divine Royalty**: Kauluakaha‘i’s title as a *nui ali‘i* (high chief) and his *ao‘ao akua* (spirit guardian) reflect theocratic governance of pre-1819 Hawai‘i, where deities and chiefs were ritually intertwined. \n   - **Transoceanic Ties**: The emphasis on the entire island chain (Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau) mirrors Hawaiian navigational networks, asserting dominion over all *mokupuni* (islands). \n   - **Chant Structure**: The tripartite structure mirrors *mele* (chants), with parenthetical annotations (*b1)*, *b2)*) likely representing later interlinear glosses for oral recitation, a practice detailed in Abraham Fornander’s 19th-century transcriptions of oral traditions.\n\nThis passage exemplifies how Hawaiian *ka‘ao* mythologizes natural forces through anthropomorphic deities while historicizing their human connections—a narrative strategy that legitimized both cosmology and social hierarchy.\n</commentary>",
  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;"
