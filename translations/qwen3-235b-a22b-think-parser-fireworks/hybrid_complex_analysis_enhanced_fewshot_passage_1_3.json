Puali‘i looked upon Pōka‘ī and desired her, saying: “I desire you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī replied: “How could you desire me? I have borne a child, and my body is now worn.” Puali‘i responded: “Those things matter not. If you desire me, let us love one another.” Pōka‘ī agreed and returned with her child and her new husband Puali‘i to dwell in the plains of Keahumoa.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**  \n• This passage introduces **Pua-li‘i** (puʻa = \"offshoot, sprout, new growth\" + liʻi = \"small, noble, childlike\"), likely a descendant of chiefs (*aliʻi nui* or *aliʻi maikaʻi*), who arrives at Honouliuli (*Hono-uliuli* = \"Dark Bay,\" an area in ʻEwa, Oʻahu) from inland Līhuʻe (*Liʻu=ʻe* = \"tied fast,\" a land division in Wāhiʻawa). His status as a *kanaka maikaʻi* (noble person) aligns with genealogical narratives where chiefs frequently traveled between upland (***mauka***) and lowland (***makai***) regions to assert authority or seek alliances.  \n– The practice of visiting homes (*kipa* at a *hale*) reflects pre-ʻAi Kapu era customs, where it was *polite* to welcome travelers (*kanaka pākākā*) with food and shelter. Pōkaʻī’s hospitality, even as a single mother, underscores the **universal obligation of generosity** (*hoʻokipa*), a foundational value in Hawaiian society that persisted even during the ʻAi Kapu.  \n• The dialogue between Pua-liʻi and Pōkaʻī reveals tensions around **postpartum relationships** and bodily autonomy. Pōkaʻī’s hesitation (“*Ua hānau wau i ke keiki, a ua ʻinoʻino koʻu kino*”) reflects historical attitudes toward women’s perceived diminished beauty or *mana* after childbirth, a common motif in moʻolelo where *wahine* were often idealized as virginal or untouched.  \n– Pua-liʻi’s rebuttal (“*He mea ʻole ia mau mea*”) subverts this norm, emphasizing **mutual desire** (*makemake*) over physical perfection. The phrase *e moe kāua* (literally “let us sleep together”) is a euphemism for both conjugal union and formal partnership, echoing traditional courtship practices where direct proposals (*ʻōlelo i ka pono*) were preferred to intermediaries.  \n\n• The relocation to **Keahumoa** (*Ke-ahu moa* = \"Heap of Chickens\")—a real place in central Oʻahu, as well as a metaphor for abundance—symbolizes the couple’s creation of a new household (*hale*). This mirrors **migratory patterns** of *aliʻi*, who founded settlements in fertile, *māla* (agricultural) regions to sustain their lineages.  \n– Pōkaʻī is described as returning with “*kāna kāne me Pualiʻi*,” clarifying that Pua-liʻi becomes her *kāne a keʻa* (husband or long-term partner), while the child (here unspecified in gender) accompanies them. The phrasing “*me kāna kāne*” emphasizes **continuity of maternal care**—Pōkaʻī does not abandon her child, a contrast to narratives like Pele’s exile, and asserts her agency in shaping her family structure.  \n• The setting of Honouliuli gains symbolic weight: as a site associated with **liminality** (dark bays often represented transition between realms), it becomes a crossroads where fate (*kuleana*) is reshaped. Pua-liʻi’s arrival there, a fisher (*lawaiʻa*) navigating both sea and land, further positions him as a mediator between worlds, a common role for *kupua* (demigods) or culture-bringers in Hawaiian lore.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
