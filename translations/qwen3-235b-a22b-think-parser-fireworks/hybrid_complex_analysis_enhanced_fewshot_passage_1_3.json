His arrival aligns with customary Hawaiian storytelling patterns where protagonists/antagonists emerge during moments of domestic stability, disrupting or redirecting narrative trajectories.  \n– The name **Līhuʻe** is geographically significant in Polynesian oral traditions. It is often paired with **Wāhiāwā** (\"place of sudden fear\" or \"abundant place\") as a regional couplet (Footnote: *Pukui et al.* (1974) associate Līhuʻe with fertile lowlands). The juxtaposition of these places underscores a contrast between inland and coastal life, a theme that may foreshadow future tensions.  \n– **Honouliuli Bay** is a historically documented fishing ground (*lawaiʻa ma kai*), but it also carries deeper symbolism: in Native Hawaiian ecological thought, the color black (*uli*) represents spiritual potency (*mana*) and serves as a threshold between human and divine realms. Pualiʻi’s occupation at this site links him to liminal spaces and transformative potential.  \n\n• The narrative follows a structured courtship archetype common to Hawaiian *moʻolelo* (stories): **Pua-liʻi visits Pōkaʻī’s *hale* (house), gazes at her (*nānā*), develops *makemake* (desire), and proposes union through *ʻōlelo pākā* (binding speech).**  \n– **Pōkaʻī**’s hesitation—citing her status as a mother (*ua hānau wau i ke keiki*) and physical imperfection (*ua ʻinoʻino koʻu kino*)—reflects pre-contact societal values around *pākī* (\"beauty\") and *hoʻokamaʻāina* (\"attachment to land/body\") but also reveals agency in negotiation. Her self-deprecation (*ʻinoʻino*) mirrors rhetorical humility (\"I am unbecoming\") used in *kaʻau* (oral traditions) to test a suitor’s sincerity.  \n– Pua-liʻi’s rebuttal (*he mea ʻole ia mau mea*)—\"those things matter not\"—signals a shift from material to spiritual emphasis, privileging emotional reciprocity (*makemake* both ways) over physical standards. This dynamic echoes pre-Christian *ʻaikāna* (intimate relationships between adults and youths) but here applies to adult courtship, possibly indicating a transition in social norms.  \n\n• The final action—Pōkaʻī agreeing (*ʻae akula*) and relocating (*hoʻi akula*) with Pua-liʻi to **Keahumoa** (lit. \"the sleeping sands\" or \"calm plains,\" possibly referencing nearby ke-ahu-moa in Wāhiāwā)—encodes layers of cultural meaning:  \n– **Relocation to the male’s homeland** (Keahumoa, noted as Pua-liʻi’s *āina hanau* [birthplace] in Footnote: *Handy & Pukui (1972) The Polynesian Family System* ) is a narrative device emphasizing patriarchal authority in pre-colonial Hawaiʻi, though Pōkaʻī’s consent subverts total male dominance.  \n– **Keahumoa** itself, as a topographical term, evokes *moʻo kāula* (shark guardians of placid waters) and *ʻōlelo noʻeau* (\"sleeping sands catch the traveler\"). The \"calmness\" (*moa*) contrasts with earlier tensions, positioning this union as a temporary *pau* (\"completion\"), a common motif in Hawaiian narratives before renewed conflict.  \n– The use of **kāne/wahine** to describe their union (*kāna kāne me Pualiʻi*) follows the *Pākī* (pairing) structure in *Moʻolelo Hawaiʻi*, symbolizing dualistic harmony (earth/heaven, female/male) foundational to *Kānaka Maoli* cosmology (*Footnote: Beckwith (1932)* Hawaiian Mythology).  \n\n• **Allegorical dimension**:  \n– Pualiʻi’s \"arrival from inland\" (*no Līhuʻe*) and Pōkaʻī’s coastal residence mirror **Hāloa’s genealogical split** (upper vs. lower *ʻāina*) while foreshadowing the role of their son **Nāmakaokapāoʻo** (\"the eyes of the pāoʻo fish\"), whose aquatic name suggests future oceanic trials.  \n– The lack of explicit *ʻAi Kapu* transgression in this scene contrasts with Paragraph 6’s ulua-as-sacrifice threat, suggesting this relationship operates within accepted norms (e.g., post-partum remarriage), though Pua-liʻi’s insistence on intimacy as transaction (*e moe kāua*—\"let us sleep together\") subtly critiques rigid kinship expectations.  \n</commentary>",
  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
