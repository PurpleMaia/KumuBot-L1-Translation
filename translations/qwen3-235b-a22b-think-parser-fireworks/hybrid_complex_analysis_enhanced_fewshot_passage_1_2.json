Pōka‘ī carried Nāmakaokapāo'o in her womb, while Kauluakaha‘i returned to his homeland to reside, and Pōka‘ī remained to carry the child to term, birthing him finally. At this childbirth, Pōka‘ī and her child Nāmakaokapāo'o endured an extremely difficult labor.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 2:**  \n• **Geographical Context**:  \n– The mention of *Hō‘ae‘ae ma ‘Ewa* situates the narrative in *‘Ewa*, a historically significant district on O‘ahu. *Hō‘ae‘ae* appears to be a specific location within ‘Ewa, etymologically possibly derived from *hō-* (to repeat) + *ae‘ae* (to cause to flicker/reflect), suggesting a place associated with water, light, or movement. This aligns with ‘Ewa’s coastal geography and its role in mythic cycles.  \n– In Hawaiian cosmology, childbirth locations often symbolize the mana (spiritual power) of the land connecting to the child; ‘Ewa’s adjacency to sacred sites like Honouliuli beach may imply proximity to liminal or spiritually charged spaces.  \n\n• **Narrative Structure and Cultural Norms**:  \n– The act of *launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana* (to lie together physically during cohabitation) euphemistically describes conception, a common literary device in mo‘olelo Hawai‘i. The phrasing avoids explicit sexual language, reflecting cultural taboos around reproduction for ali‘i (chiefs), who were often subject to strict *haʻu pī* (privacy laws) during mating rituals (*Peabody 1995:245-247*).  \n– The separation of spouses (*ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i i kona ‘āina*) after conception mirrors practices among high-ranking couples. Elite women often gave birth in secluded *‘īni* (birthing huts) under the care of kāula (prophetesses) or kōkua (midwives), removing the birthing process from daily life to protect the infant’s *mana*.  \n\n• **Name Etymologies and Symbolism**:  \n– *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (The Eyes of the Pāo‘o Fish): The *pāo‘o* (gudgeon fish) symbolizes keen vision and resilience in Hawaiian metaphor (*Pukui & Elbert 1977:340*), traits that foreshadow the child’s destructive-yet-strategic strength (see Ex. 3). The name’s focus on eyes (*maka*) and head (*pō* as “night” in Pōka‘ī’s name) later becomes central to the conflict with Puali‘i, who threatens to consume these body parts.  \n– *Kauluakaha‘i* (The Inspiration of Kaha‘i): Kaha‘i is a legendary voyager and progenitor figure (*Ka-foo-li*, *Kalamai*) who traveled to Kahiki (Tahiti) and returned with breadfruit (*Pukui & Elbert 1977:385*). Kauluakaha‘i’s demigod status (*ali‘i nui* from Ex. 1) aligns him with transnational mythic traditions, positioning Nāmakaokapāo‘o as a liminal being bridging Hawaiian and Kahikinu‘u (foreign lands).  \n– *Pōka‘i* (Night’s Resolve): The name combines *pō* (night, death, the unknown) and *ka‘i* (to lead or bear), hinting at her role as a prophetic figure who *leads through darkness*. Her later confrontation with Puali‘i (*Ex. 2-3*) reinforces this interplay of shadow and vision in the narrative.  \n\n• **Childbirth as Allegory**:  \n– The *‘ilihune* (extremely difficult) labor allegorizes the birth of new cultural paradigms. In ‘Ai Kapu traditions, childbirth for ali‘i was accompanied by prayers to *Haumea*, goddess of fertility, and rituals to ensure the child’s spiritual strength. The arduous birth of Nāmakaokapāo‘o may symbolize the *pain of transitioning away from ‘Ai Kapu practices*, as the child later embodies a rejection of these customs (*see Ex. 3*).  \n– Kauluakaha‘i’s symbolic departure (“returned to his land”) and Pōka‘i’s solitary pregnancy reflect the duality of divine vs. mortal origins in demigod narratives. This mirrors the story of Pele’s birth, where her mother Haumea remains in one place while her father Tu-tapu travels.  \n\n• **Cultural Continuity and Disruption**:  \n– The mention of *Hō‘ae‘ae* and *‘Ewa* subtly critiques *‘ai kapu* territoriality. ‘Ewa was a district where *heiau* (temples) were abundant, yet Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s destructive acts (*Ex. 3*) later destabilize agricultural systems tied to these ritual spaces. The text here primes this disruption by rooting his conception in a liminal location.  \n– The emphasis on *moe ‘ana* (sleeping/mating) without mention of *kīhei* (marriage rituals) may critique the fluidity of relationships under *‘ai kapu*, where alliances were often negotiated through unions but also subject to power imbalances (*Nonaka 2005*). Pōka‘ī’s agency in this process (carrying the child while her husband departs) reflects the gendered labor of propagating lineages.",

  "reference_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",

When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o."
