  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_translation": "Then Puali‘i died, and Namakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Poka‘ī, where they resided. Namakaokapāo‘o ate no food. At that time, Amā‘u was the ruling chief of O‘ahu, residing in Waikīkī. A certain man came from Honouliuli to Waikīkī, where the chief was staying, and said: \"O chief! There is a child most powerful indeed—his father has died, and his head was cast into the ocean, far away, a great distance, five miles in length.\" Upon hearing this, Amā‘u said, \"It is my might that caused him to die, yet if my might were not present, he would not have died.\" As he spoke in Waikīkī, Namakaokapāo‘o heard these words concerning himself.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nThen Puali‘i died, and Namakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Poka‘ī, where they resided. Namakaokapāo‘o ate no food. At that time, Amā‘u was the ruling chief of O‘ahu, residing in Waikīkī. A certain man came from Honouliuli to Waikīkī, where the chief was staying, and said: \"O chief!

The story interweaves divine and human realms: Namakaokapāo‘o, a sea deity, is portrayed here in his mortal phase as the son of Poka‘ī, his survival in famine, and his fateful connection to the chief Amā‘u. The reference to a head cast into the ocean reflects *kanikau* (mourning rites) or ritual disposals of the dead, common in chiefly traditions. Amā‘u’s claim of causing death through his *mana* (divine power) underscores the Hawaiian concept of sovereignty tied to supernatural authority. The geographical specificity (Honouliuli, Waikīkī) anchors the mythos in real landscapes, illustrating how oral traditions integrate topography and theology. The passage also highlights the theme of reciprocity between gods and humans, a central motif in Hawaiian creation stories.  \n</Commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
