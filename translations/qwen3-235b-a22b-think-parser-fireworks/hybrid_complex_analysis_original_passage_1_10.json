At that time, there ruled a chief named ‘Ama‘u over O‘ahu, residing in Waikīkī. A man journeyed from Honouliuli to Waikīkī, where the chief resided, and said: “O Chief! A mighty and strong child has perished; their father has died, and their head has drifted far out to sea, a vast distance—five miles. Upon hearing this, ‘Ama‘u replied, “Indeed, it is my child’s strength that has caused my death, but I shall not perish from that strength.” As she spoke these words in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard them, for they pertained to her.",

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nPuali‘i died, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to her mother, Poka‘ī, and they lived together; however, Nāmakaokapāo‘o had no food. At that time, there ruled a chief named ‘Ama‘u over O‘ahu, residing in Waikīkī. A man journeyed from Honouliuli to Waikīkī, where the chief resided, and said: “O Chief! A mighty and strong child has perished; their father has died, and their head has drifted far out to sea, a vast distance—five miles. Upon hearing this, ‘Ama‘u replied, “Indeed, it is my child’s strength that has caused my death, but I shall not perish from that strength.” As she spoke these words in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard them, for they pertained to her.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a larger mythological or genealogical narrative in early Hawaiian literature, likely embedded in the traditions of the Pele cycle or the Kamapuaʻa-Pele rivalry. It employs a shifting focus between characters (Puali‘i, Nāmakaokapāo‘o, Poka‘i, and Chief ‘Ama‘u), illustrating thematic elements of **strength (ikaika)**, **prophecy**, and **the interplay between human and divine forces** typical of Kānaka Maoli storytelling.  \n\nCulturally, the story reflects the **sacred obligations of lineage** (e.g., Nāmakaokapāo‘o seeking refuge with her mother) and **oral historiography**, where place names like Waikīkī and Honouliuli root mythic events in tangible geography. The metaphor of a child’s head turning seaward for five miles evokes **symbolic action**—possibly alluding to the severing of ties to the land or the existential threat of oceanic forces (kai), which are associated with the goddess Namakaokapāoʻo herself in other traditions.  \n\nLinguistically, the text showcases the **Hawaiian language’s narrative economy**: concise clauses convey complex relationships and foreshadowing. The line \"ʻIo hea kona ikaika a make au iā ia, akā, i ʻole au e make iā ia ‘aʻohe ona ikaika\" (\"Truly, my child’s strength has killed me, yet I shall not die from a strengthless one\") uses **parallelism** and **antithesis** to emphasize the power dynamics between ‘Ama‘u and the deceased child.  \n\nHistorically, the mention of Chief ‘Ama‘u in Waikīkī may signal a pre-unification era when O‘ahu was ruled by competing ali‘i, offering a glimpse into **pre-contact political geography**. The interwoven voices (e.g., the messenger’s report and ‘Ama‘u’s response) mirror the performative aspects of mele (chant) and moʻolelo (story) in transmitting history.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
