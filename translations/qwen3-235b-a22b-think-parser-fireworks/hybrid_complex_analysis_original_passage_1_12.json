  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nChief Amaʻu from Waikīkī sent four warriors, each leading a cadre of eighteen men, for a total of seventy-two attackers. Upon reaching the fields of Keahumoa, they entered the house but found no one. As they prepared to retreat, Namakaokapāoʻo called out from the summit. Hearing his voice but seeing no one, they inquired, “Where are you who speaks?” He responded, “Here I am above.” Eight men promptly climbed the structure—four approaching from the rear and four from the front—and captured Namakaokapāoʻo. He asked, “What foolish purpose brings you here?” They replied, “We have come to fight Namakaokapāoʻo, the cowardly child who, despite his strength and bravery, murdered his own father Pualiʻi.”  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is embedded within a traditional Hawaiian narrative exploring themes of conflict, lineage, and supernatural agency. The text forms part of a larger story centered on Namakaokapāoʻo (“Namaka the Heartless”), a figure often associated with vengeance and moral complexity in Hawaiian mythology. The episode illustrates a classic *mākākū* (epic) structure, where a ruler's military force confronts a formidable antagonist with divine or extraordinary attributes.  \n\n**Cultural Context**: The invasion of Keahumoa’s property and the confrontation with Namakaokapāoʻo reflect Hawaiian concepts of *kuleana* (responsibility/rights) and *mau* (resistance). The attackers’ surprise at encountering an opponent who communicates without physical visibility underscores the cultural understanding of spiritual or supernatural beings (*ʻaumakua*, *moʻo*) who could manifest omens or test intruders.  \n\n**Historical Insight**: The mention of strategic positioning (e.g., climbing the house’s front and rear simultaneously) mirrors pre-contact Hawaiian military tactics, where coordination and terrain knowledge were critical. The reference to patricide—“murdered his own father Pualiʻi”—may symbolize taboo-breaking, a recurring motif in Hawaiian lore that invites divine repercussions.  \n\n**Linguistic Features**: The narrative employs classical Hawaiian devices such as **chiastic structure** (e.g., *komolākou ā loko o ka hale, ʻa ʻohe kanaka*—“they entered the house—found no one”) to heighten suspense. The use of *nīnau pū* (rhetorical questions) (“Where are you?” / “Here I am above”) reinforces the tension between tangible and intangible presence, a common theme in oral literature emphasizing fate and unseen forces.  \n\nThis excerpt is part of a broader lore cycle surrounding Namakaokapāoʻo, whose tales often interrogate notions of justice, inheritance, and the blurred line between mortal and supernatural beings in Indigenous Hawaiian cosmology.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
