They arrived at the plain of Keahumoa and entered the house, but there was no one inside. They prepared to return when Namakaokapāo’o called out from atop the ridge. Though they heard her voice, her body was not seen. They asked, “Who is it speaking?” Namakaokapāo’o replied, “It is I who am here above.” Eight men climbed up—one group of four behind the house, another four in front—and captured Namakaokapāo’o. She asked, “What is the purpose of your coming?” They answered, “We came to do battle with Namakaokapāo’o, a certain cruel child like you, strong and greatly brave, who destroyed his own father, Pualani.”",

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nAma’u, the chief from Waikīkī, sent forth four war parties, each containing eighteen warriors, making a total of four groups. They arrived at the plain of Keahumoa and entered the house, but there was no one inside. They prepared to return when Namakaokapāo’o called out from atop the ridge. Though they heard her voice, her body was not seen. They asked, “Who is it speaking?” Namakaokapāo’o replied, “It is I who am here above.” Eight men climbed up—one group of four behind the house, another four in front—and captured Namakaokapāo’o. She asked, “What is the purpose of your coming?” They answered, “We came to do battle with Namakaokapāo’o, a certain cruel child like you, strong and greatly brave, who destroyed his own father, Pualani.”  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a dense narrative section in the text that sets up conflict between rival factions led by powerful figures like Namakaokapāo’o. The structure reflects traditional Hawaiian literary forms, such as oral hula traditions or epic chants, emphasizing martial drama, rhetorical exchanges, and supernatural elements. The specific reference to Waikīkī (historically a strategic center on O’ahu) and the mention of Pualani (likely a titular name for a lineage or deity) root the story in Polynesian cosmology and aliʻi (chiefly) struggles for dominance. The numerical specificity (e.g., four groups of eighteen) may symbolize cultural codes, such as the significance of the number seventy-two (4 × 18), which appears in other Pacific narratives as a marker of completeness or cosmic order. The dialogue style mirrors traditional Hawaiian oratory, where challenges are met with layered allusions and genealogical defensiveness. Later chapters likely resolve these tensions through further combat or ritualized reconciliation, characteristic of moʻolelo (historical stories) told by kūpuna (elders) to instill values of courage and strategic acumen.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
