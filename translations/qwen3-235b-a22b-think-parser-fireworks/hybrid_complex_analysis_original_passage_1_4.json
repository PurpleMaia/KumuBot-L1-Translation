  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nHe lived there and worked the land as a farmer, leaving behind two extensive, long-lasting taro patches that remain to this day. These patches were named Namakaokapāoʻo, a name that endures until this day. When the taro was ready, Pualiʻi made a solemn vow: “The head (first fruits) of the ulua and the taro belong to me, Pualiʻi, and then, only after, my wife Pōkaʻī and the rest may eat.” Therefore, Pualiʻi went down to the Honouliuli sea to fish for food to enjoy with the taro.\n</translation>\n\n---\n\n</commentary>\n**Cultural Context:**\n- **Taro as Sustenance & Spirituality:** Taro (\"ʻuala\") is a foundational crop in Hawaiian culture, symbolizing ancestral connection to the gods and the land (\"ʻāina\"). The emphasis on long-lasting taro patches (\"māla ʻuala lōʻihi\") reflects the central role of subsistence farming in Hawaiian society and the importance of sustainable agriculture for family and community survival.\n- **Offerings & Hierarchy:** Pualiʻi's vow (\"ōlelo hoʻohiki\") to claim the \"head\" (first harvest) of the taro and ulua (a large fish) aligns with traditional practices of offering the first fruits to deities or high-ranking individuals before communal consumption. This ritual reinforced social hierarchy and reciprocal obligations between humans and the divine.\n- **Gender Roles:** The sequence of consumption—Pualiʻi first, then his wife Pōkaʻi, then others—reflects customary Hawaiian social norms where firstborn or male family members often received first portions, though women like Pōkaʻi still participated in communal feasts.\n- **Honouliuli:** This coastal area near Pearl Harbor was historically significant for its fishponds and fishing grounds. Fishing for \"iʻa ʻai pū\" (food to eat with taro) underscores the integration of marine and agricultural resources in the Hawaiian diet.\n\n**Linguistic Features:**\n- **Semantic Naming:** \"Nāmakaokapāoʻo\" likely evokes the sea goddess Nāmaka, with \"kapāoʻo\" suggesting a breath/essence or hardy quality, symbolizing vitality. Naming landfeatures after deities anchored them in cosmology.\n- **Temporal Markers:** \"Noho ihola i laila\" (he settled there), \"ā hiki i kēia lā\" (until this day), and \"no laila\" (therefore) structure the narrative temporally, emphasizing enduring traditions.\n- **Passive Constructions:** The passive verb \"kapa ʻia\" (was named) omits the namer, focusing instead on the act of naming itself, a common feature in Hawaiian texts to emphasize significance over agency.\n- **Possessive Phrasing:** The possessive construction \"ā kālua\" (my two) with \"ke poʻo\" (the head) ties identity (\"kāna ʻōlelo hoʻohiki\") to ceremonial acts, blending personal and spiritual authority.\n\n**Historical Significance:**\n- **Oral Tradition in Written Form:** This passage exemplifies how 19th-century Hawaiian-language texts preserved pre-contact oral traditions, myths, and social practices. The vivid details about taro patches and fishing reflect efforts to document Hawaiian lifeways during a period of rapid change under colonial influence.\n- **Legacy of Place Names:** The persistence of names like \"Nāmakaokapāoʻo\" and \"Honouliuli\" illustrates how place names encoded ancestral memory. Modern revitalization of these names (e.g., Honouliuli National Historic Site) today emphasizes cultural reclamation.\n- **Taro's Endurance:** The phrase \"ā hiki i kēia lā\" (until this day) highlights how Hawaiian texts documented ongoing continuity with ancestral practices, even as plantation economies later disrupted taro cultivation in favor of cash crops.\n\nThis passage is both a practical narrative of farming/fishing and a symbolic affirmation of Hawaiian values—respect for land, kinship, and divine reciprocity—embedded in a linguistic structure that mirrors oral storytelling traditions.",
  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
