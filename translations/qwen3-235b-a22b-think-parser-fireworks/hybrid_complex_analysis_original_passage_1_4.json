  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nHe dwelled there, worked as a farmer, and established two large taro fields that still remain until today, and the names of these fields have become known as Namakaokapao`o until today. When the sweet potatoes matured, Puali`i spoke his proverb: \"Only until my twin takes the head of the ulua fish along with the sweet potato, will Puali`i eat, and afterward, freely shall his wife, Poka`i, and the others eat.\" Because of this, Puali`i descended to the shores of Honouliuli to catch fish to accompany the sweet potato.\n</translation>\n\n---\n\nThe passage offers rich insights into traditional Hawaiian agro-ecological practices, social customs, and linguistics:\n\n**Cultural Context:**\n1. **Agricultural Land Stewardship:**  \n   The mention of two *māla ʻuala lōʻihi* (loʻihi sweet potato fields) highlights the importance of terraced or irrigated farming systems (*loʻi kalo* for taro) in pre-contact Hawaii. Fields named *Namakaokapāoʻo* (\"The Eyes of the Octopus\" or \"The Watchful Eyes\"), persisting \"until today,\" reflect ancestral land tenure systems and the spiritual connection between people and place (*āina*).\n\n2. **Social Hierarchy in Food Distribution:**  \n   Pualiʻi’s proverb underscores rigid hierarchies: the chief (*aliʻi*) eats first (\"Pualiʻi, a laila, noa…\") while family and commoners follow. The phrase \"ke poʻo o ka ulua me ka ʻuala\" (head of the ulua fish with the sweet potato) may symbolize the chief’s right to the choicest portions, a practice tied to religious beliefs (*kapu* system) that sanctified leadership roles.\n\n3. **Proverbial Wisdom (*ʻŌlelo Noʻeau*):**  \n   Oral traditions encoded societal values. Pualiʻi’s metaphor blends humor and authority, asserting precedence through familial ties (\"my twin\"), perhaps referencing a rivalry or strategic alliance with a sibling. Such proverbs preserved communal memory and social norms.\n\n**Linguistic Features:**\n1. **Passive Constructions:**  \n   The passive \"ua kapa ʻia ka inoa\" (the name was given) emphasizes the action (naming) over the actor, a common technique in Hawaiian historiographical writing.\n\n2. **Temporal Markers:**  \n   \"E waiho nei ā hiki i kēia lā\" (left until now) uses the continuative aspect (\"nei\") and temporal clitic (\"ā\") to stress the fields’ enduring physical presence, linking past to present.\n\n3. **Code-Switching in Names:**  \n   *Pōkaʻī* (Pokai) and *Honouliuli* show Hawaiianization of potential foreign names (e.g., \"Pokai\" resembling Polynesian *po*kai, \"ocean/gather\") while *Honouliuli* (literally \"dark, swirling waters\") references a real coastal district on Oʻahu, now infamous for its WWII internment camp.\n\n**Historical Significance:**  \n1. **Pre-Contact Economy:**  \n   This account predates Western contact (1778), illustrating a subsistence economy reliant on *ʻuala* (sweet potato) and fishing. The coordination of horticulture and aquaculture demonstrates resource diversification.\n\n2. **Ritual Fishing Practices:**  \n   Honouliuli, associated with sharks and turbulent currents, would have required ritual preparation (*hoʻokupu* offerings) and expert knowledge of marine ecosystems. The act of fishing there symbolizes both spiritual and ecological mastery.\n\n3. **Colonial Threats to Traditional Systems:**  \n   While not explicit, the phrase \"ā hiki i kēia lā\" (\"until today\") subtly acknowledges the collapse of kalo/taro dominance due to missionary-era wetland drainage and sugar monocropping, making this record both descriptive and elegiac.\n\n**Scholarly Debates:**  \nSome historians argue *malu mālō* (loin guard warriors) or *koʻa* (fishing shrines) may be implied at Honouliuli, suggesting spiritual protection for Pualiʻi’s fishing expedition. Others note name-order inversion (\"Nāmaka\") could indicate a variant of Namaka, the sea goddess associated with Hiʻiaka, hinting at mytho-historical subtext. The discrepancy between *ʻuala* (sweet potato) and *māla ʻuala* (typically taro fields) remains unresolved, inviting speculation about pre-contact crop terminology evolution.",
  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
