  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**  \n• This passage builds on earlier motifs of agrarian labor and symbolic sustenance, while foreshadowing violence tied to the 'Ai Kapu era’s sacrificial symbolism. The dual sweet potato patches named after Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o (\"the eyes of the *pāo’o* fish\") mark a physical legacy in the land, connecting the protagonist to cyclical cultivation practices central to Hawaiian cosmology. Sweet potatoes (*‘uala*) are *kanu ho‘okamatā* (staple crops) requiring strict *kapu* observance for successful harvests, reflecting the paradox of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s relationship with tradition—he embodies ancestral power but destabilizes it.  \n• Pua-li'i’s declaration, \"*Aia ā kālua ke po‘o o ka ulua me ka ‘uala*\" (Where is the ulua’s head paired with the sweet potato?), evokes 'Ai Kapu protocols where *ulua* (trevally fish) symbolically substituted human sacrifices at heiau (*footnote:* Pukui & Elbert (1986) note *ulua* as a homonym for \"to increase\" and a term of endearment, bridging literal fish with divine-human exchange). By demanding the *ulua’s head* to accompany the *‘uala*, he invokes a ritualistic balance between land (*‘āina mai uka* = upland “inland” foods) and sea (*‘āina mai kai* = oceanic resources), with the fish’s head serving as the sacred portion (*kinolau*) offered to gods before consumption.  \n– The threat to withhold food (*noa, ‘ai kāna wahine... me nā mea ‘ē a‘e*) from Pōka'ī and others until Pua-li'i secures the *ulua* aligns with *kapu aloha ‘āina* (territorial taboos where families fasted until harvest rituals concluded). Yet Pua-li'i perverts this practice: instead of fasting to ensure communal kinolau access, he weaponizes it to legitimize his vendetta against Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, implying the older *kapu* system’s potential for tyranny.  \n• **Spatial alignment:** Pua-li'i journeys to Ho-no-u-li'uli (dark bay), a liminal zone traditionally associated with *kupua* (supernatural agents) and *mo‘o* (dragonfish) deities. The choice of *Honouliuli*—linked to 'Ewa district’s historical *heiau mo‘o*—suggests Pua-li'i adopting malevolent *kupua* powers to confront Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o, whose own *manawa* (courage) and small-statured strength mirror archetypal *kupua* traits.  \n– This spatial-rhetorical pairing (sweet potato fields → sacred bay) frames the conflict as one between *ʻolelo kū* (ritual invocations) and *ʻolelo hōʻemi* (destructive speech). Pua-li'i’s dependence on *ulua* to ritually sanctify *‘uala* signals regression to pre-contact *kapu* rigor, while Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s role as an agricultural *kinolau* emblem (fields bearing his name) points toward a post-*kapu* world where land stewards (*kuaʻāina*) replaced priestly elites (*kāhuna kapā*).  \n• The persistent duality of two sweet potato patches and the ritual use of \"head\" (*po‘o*) and \"eyes\" (*maka*) echo earlier numerical riddles (2 fields, 4 vines, 40 mounds). Here, the two patches represent *kanu kū* (male, sun-facing crops) and *kanu a wāhine* (female, shade-tolerant crops), with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo'o’s name binding both identities—a transgressive synthesis of gendered agricultural *kapu* that foreshadows his ability to dismantle 'Ai Kapu conventions entirely by paragraph’s end.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
