  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**  \n• **Legacy in landscape:**  \n– The survival of the sweet potato (*ʻuala*) fields of \"Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo\" until the present underscores the protagonist’s enduring cultural and agricultural legacy. This aligns with the Hawaiian practice of *hoʻopaʻa inoa* (naming places after significant acts or people), where the boy’s early-life feat of cultivation becomes immortalized in topography.  \n– The naming tradition (*ka inoa o ia mau māla*) reflects oral history’s role in preserving stories across generations, even as the protagonist’s name itself—Nāmakaokapāoʻo (Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo, \"The Eyes of the Demigod’s Fish\")—alludes to his supernatural lineage (from a divine parent, likely Hema, a voyaging demigod associated with healing; see Pukui & Elbert, p. 138).  \n\n• **ʻAi Kapu and food hierarchies:**  \n– Pualiʻi’s declaration—\"*Aia ā kālua ke poʻo o ka ulua me ka ʻuala*\" (\"When I have eaten the head of the ulua with the sweet potato\")—reinforces the rigid rules of the *ʻai kapu* system, where certain foods (like the ulua fish) were ritually reserved for high-ranking males.  \n– The *poʻo* (head) of the ulua represents the highest-status portion, reserved for the *kāne* (man) in *ʻai kapu* customs (Beckwith, *Hawaiian Mythology*, p. 256). Pualiʻi’s act of eating this portion symbolizes his assertion of *kapu* authority, contrasting with his later integration of Pōkaʻī (a woman) into the meal (*ʻai kāna wahine*), which subtly subverts norms by allowing her to share food prepared under his privilege.  \n\n• **Honouliuli’s cultural resonance:**  \n– Pualiʻi’s journey to *Honouliuli* (\"Dark Bay\") situates him in a mythologically charged location. Esteemed as a haunt of *ʻaumakua* (ancestral deities), Honouliuli was associated with Kamohoaliʻi, the great shark god who guided Pele’s canoe to Hawaiʻi (Malo, *Hawaiian Antiquities*, p. 102). His choice to fish here suggests a conscious engagement with ancestral power, perhaps to validate his threatened dominance over Nāmakaokapāoʻo.  \n– The pairing of *ulua* (a large jack fish) and *ʻuala* (sweet potato) mirrors the symbolic tension in Example 3, where *ulua* substitutes human sacrifice. Here, though, the *ulua*’s \"sacrifice\" enables the *kāne*’s meal, while the *ʻuala*—a staple of commoners—sustains the wahine and others, reinforcing class divisions.  \n\n• **Generational and ideological tension:**  \n– This scene juxtaposes Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s lasting agricultural work (his fields endure \"until today\") with Pualiʻi’s transient consumption rituals. The boy’s *ʻuala* symbolizes sustenance and continuity, while Pualiʻi’s *ulua* hunt underscores the impermanence of male-dominated *kapu* systems.  \n– The recurring reference to *ʻuala* may reflect the story’s embedded critique of *ʻai kapu*. Unlike taro (*kalo*), which was linked to the god Haloa and reserved for rituals (Pukui & Handy, *The Polynesian Family System*, p. 41), *ʻuala* (originating in Polynesia but not central to cosmogony) was more accessible to women and commoners. By focusing on *ʻuala*, the text might subtly valorize egalitarian practices over the *kapu* hierarchy.  \n\n• **Name etymologies and divine echoes:**  \n– *Nāmakaokapāoʻo*: The hybridization of *nā maka* (\"the eyes\") with *pāoʻo* (a fish or \"head\") mirrors the boy’s demigod status. In mythology, eyes (*maka*) often symbolize spiritual sight (e.g., Namaka’s sister Pele’s volcanic \"eyes\"), while the *pāoʻo* fish (a wrasse or goatfish) connects to *ʻaumakua* like Lono and Kanaloa, gods associated with farming and voyaging.  \n– *Honouliuli*: The name’s referent to darkness (*uli*) and connotation of spiritual potency aligns with its role as a site of shark divinities, linking Pualiʻi’s fishing to mythic precedents where humans petitioned gods for sustenance.",

  "reference_translation": "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 4:**• Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’;"
