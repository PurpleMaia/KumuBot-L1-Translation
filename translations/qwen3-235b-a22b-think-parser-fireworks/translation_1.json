  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_translation": "\n\n<translation> Because of Pikoiakaalala's great gluttony, he separated from the people and returned to his sisters, where the pig and food had already been cooked. Before eating, Pikoiakaalala declared: \"Listen well, all of you, I have a rule for eating: no talking, no laughing, no stretching, no picking, no whispering, until I finish.\" He began eating the pig, one scoop of poi, one portion of taro, money, ate again, nearly finishing the remaining pig and all the food in the oven. A man said: \"This food is for the gods,\" and cut it short. The old woman asked: \"Are you stopping eating? Why?\" \"No, I am already full,\" he replied. \"Yes, we have heard your rule,\" said the old woman. From this eating by Pikoiakaalala, his body grew and became a large, fine man, but his breath was breathless. </translation>"
