Kauluakahaʻi thus ties the family to transoceanic heroism and breadfruit introduction traditions, critical to Hawaiian subsistence.  \n• **Cultural Context:**  \n– Divine ancestry (*ʻaoʻao akua*) signals demigod status, a common motif in pre-ʻAi Kapu narratives where supernatural beings maintained cosmic balance (*pono*). The father’s dual rank as *aliʻi nui* (high chief) and part-god underscores how Hawaiian cosmology merged spiritual and political authority.  \n– Geographic scope from Hawaiʻi to Niʻihau implies pan-insular recognition of the child’s uniqueness, mirroring the unifying role of deities like Pele or Kanaloa in traditional genealogies.  \n– The juxtaposition of *ʻuʻuku* (small) and *ikaika* (strength) recalls the *nāhenahe* (graceful subtlety) of ancestral heroes — subtle power often wielded by wāhine (women) and kanaka lawelawe (servant-classs) in oral tradition.",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 1:**• It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;"
