  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_translation": "Puali‘i died, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and they dwelled together. Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u was the ruling chief of O‘ahu, residing in Waikīkī. A man journeyed from Honouliuli to Waikīkī, where the chief was staying, and declared: “O Chief! There is a most powerful youth whose father has died, and his head was carried far out to sea, a very long distance—five miles.” Upon hearing this, ‘Ama‘u realized that his own strength had caused his death, yet he did not perish due to his own strength. While he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard these words spoken about himself.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nPuali‘i died, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o returned to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and they dwelled together. Nāmakaokapāo‘o did not eat food. At that time, ‘Ama‘u was the ruling chief of O‘ahu, residing in Waikīkī. A man journeyed from Honouliuli to Waikīkī, where the chief was staying, and declared: “O Chief! There is a most powerful youth whose father has died, and his head was carried far out to sea, a very long distance—five miles.” Upon hearing this, ‘Ama‘u realized that his own strength had caused his death, yet he did not perish due to his own strength. While he was speaking in Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o overheard these words spoken about himself.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\nThis passage is part of a larger mythological or historical narrative rooted in Hawaiian oral tradition, likely drawn from 19th-century written sources (e.g., works by Samuel Kamakau or David Malo) that preserved pre-contact stories. The text interweaves genealogical, supernatural, and heroic elements. Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a name associated with the sea goddess Namaka, is depicted here as a semi-divine figure marked by ascetic practices (fasting). The reference to ‘Ama‘u, a chief of O‘ahu, and the geographic markers (Waikīkī, Honouliuli) anchor the story in the island’s sacred landscape. The prophetic declaration about a youth whose father died and whose head was swept out to sea introduces themes of fate, strength, and the interplay between human and divine agency. The narrative structure—shifting perspectives between characters and locations—reflects traditional Hawaiian storytelling techniques, emphasizing interconnectedness and foreshadowing future conflicts or revelations.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14**• From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of  Christianity’s defeat over the ‘Ai Kapu, with   Nāmakaokapāo‘o representing progressive   Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his  mother, Pōka‘ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians’ futile attempts to hold onto ‘Ai Kapu culture."
