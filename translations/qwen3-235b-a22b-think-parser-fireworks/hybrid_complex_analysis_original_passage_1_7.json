Upon seeing him, the children fled in terror to a safe distance. Puali‘i addressed Namakaokapāo‘o: \"Hey! This pig fork in my hand is meant to strike your head today, sever it, and then cook and eat it before you do.\" However, Namakaokapāo‘o paid no heed to Puali‘i’s words. Speaking again, Puali‘i repeated himself a second time. As Puali‘i prepared to stab Namakaokapāo‘o with his pig fork, Namakaokapāo‘o recited a death incantation for Puali‘i.

The act of roasting boars (*makai ‘uala*) over a fire symbolizes the intersection of earthly (fire as *ahi*, a symbol of Pele) and oceanic (Namaka’s domain) forces. The pig fork (*ko‘ilipi*), a mundane cooking tool, becomes a symbolic weapon, illustrating how everyday objects could mediate divine conflict. Children (*keiki*) fleeing underscores the peril of witnessing such battles, a recurring theme in Hawaiian stories where human or divine conflicts unfold in the physical world.  \n\n**Linguistic Features**:  \n1. **Syntax & Discourse**: The narrative uses passive constructions (e.g., *‘Ike maila nā keiki a pau loa*) to emphasize collective action (\"all the children saw him\"). Dialogue tags (*‘ōlelo akula*, *‘ōlelo hou*) structure the escalating confrontation, a common technique in oral traditions.  \n2. **Figurative Language**: The incantation (*pule make*) employs **repetition** (e.g., *e waiho paha*), **metaphor** (e.g., \"eye of my sweetheart\"), and **metonymy** (linking *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* to Pele/Namaka) to evoke spiritual forces. Names like *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* (lit. \"the light of the earth’s eyes\") play on Pele’s epithet *Kuhaimakani*, blending deities into a single cosmic entity.  \n3. **Symbolic Contrasts**: The pig fork (fire) vs. the incantation (spiritual power) mirrors the tension between physical violence and *mana* (spiritual authority). The line *\"‘o kānaka nō me ka ihe, ‘o ka ihe nō me ka pahu\"* (\"the man with the spear, the spear with the drum\") may reference the cyclical nature of conflict, where weapons and warriors become indistinguishable.  \n\n**Historical Significance**:  \n1. **Oral Tradition**: The story preserves pre-colonial Hawaiian values, such as the efficacy of incantations and the spiritual agency of *moʻolelo* (literally \"old tales,\" but serving as historical records). Chants like this were mnemonic devices for transmitting knowledge.  \n2. **Deity Interactions**: Namaka’s dual role as a nurturing and vengeful figure (roasting boars yet chanting death) reflects broader Polynesian traditions, where deities embody paradoxical traits (e.g., the Greek Artemis or indigenous Māori Tangaroa).  \n3. **Genealogical Ties**: The mention of *Kukui‘aimakaokalani* links Namaka to Pele, emphasizing familial bonds between earth and sea deities. This interplay explains natural phenomena, such as how storms are mortal conflicts reimagined through divine drama.  \n4. **Warfare & Ritual**: The use of a pig fork as a weapon parallels the symbolic use of fishing hooks or canoes in Hawaiian epics, blurring lines between survival tools and instruments of power. The chant’s closing line, *\"Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o,\"* subverts expectations: the goddess, often portrayed as invincible, is targeted for death, highlighting the capriciousness of divine power.  \n\n**Key Themes**:  \n- **Power Struggles**: The passage illustrates tensions between gods, humans, and natural forces, common in Hawaiian myth (e.g., the rivalry between Pele and Namaka).  \n- **Orality & Performance**: The chant’s cadence and repetition suggest it was performed, with bodily gestures (*hōhē wale*) to channel mana.  \n- **Cannibalistic Motifs**: Boars, roasting, and threats of decapitation reference ritualized warfare and sacrificial practices, though mythicized here to emphasize spiritual rather than literal consumption.  \n\nThis text exemplifies how Hawaiian narratives encode ecological, social, and metaphysical knowledge into dramatic, character-driven tales, preserving worldview and cosmology long before written records.  \n</commentary>",
  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
