Nāmakaokapāo‘o at this time had a very small body—two spans and half of his height, not yet strong enough to hold things firmly, just able to move about. Upon arriving at the sweet potato patches, he turned to the children and said, “Pull up the earth heap and the leaves entirely from the top, leaving nothing to grow.” However, the children were afraid, so they only lightly touched the sweet potatoes, not actually pulling up the heaps.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**  \n• **New narrative focus and continuity:**  \n– This paragraph bridges Puali‘i’s absence (fishing) with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s emergence into active defiance against agricultural norms. The shift in setting to Puali‘i’s sweet potato patches (māla ‘uala) underscores the colonial undertones of land ownership (“his” sweet potatoes), contrasting with the primordial Hawaiian worldview where 'āina was communally tended.  \n• **Reinforcement of Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s paradoxical strength and physical description:**  \n– “He kino ‘u‘uku loa” (very small body) reinforces his introduction as a child of “small stature” (Example 1), yet his name etymology (“Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o”: the eyes of the pāo‘o fish, a small coral reef fish) symbolizes **keen perception** amid physical diminutiveness.  \n– “‘Elua kapua‘i me ka hapa kona ki‘eki‘e” (two fathoms and half of his height) employs Hawaiian linear measurements metaphorically. A kapua‘i (fathom) symbolizes human striving for land dominion, while “half its height” may allegorize a spirit-being’s relationship to physical reality—half divine, half mortal. The phrase contrasts with traditional genealogical power statements (e.g., Example 1’s demigod lineage) to foreshadow his **unorthodox leadership**.  \n• **Generational conflict and agricultural destruction:**  \n– Sending seventeen children (he ‘umi kumamāhiku = 10 + 7 = 17) to uproot Puali‘i’s crops evokes numerological symbolism: 17 as a composite of 10 (completeness) and 7 (spiritual power) suggests Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s command over **multiplicity in unity**, a theme central to post-contact Hawaiian resistance narratives.  \n– The command to “huhuki i ka pu‘e me ka lau ‘uala ā pau loa” (pull up the earth heap and leaves entirely) violates the ‘ai kapu’s protocol. Under ‘Ai Kapu, root crops like ‘uala (sweet potato) were planted, harvested, and consumed under strict rites. Ripping them up without ritual blessing incurred spiritual and social sanctions, positioning Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a **transgressive force challenging kapu order**.  \n• **Children’s fear and Puali‘i’s looming authority:**  \n– The children’s maka‘u (fear) and half-hearted action (“kāohi mālie nō ma ka ‘uala”) reflect adherence to ‘Ai Kapu’s hierarchical structure, where commoners feared repercussions for violating kapu. Their inaction contrasts with Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s authority, who—aligning with the *kāhiko* (ancient pre-civilized) archetype—acts as a **catalyst** for unchecked transformation.  \n– Puali‘i’s impending return (“Ho‘i maila kona makua kāne kōlea ā hiki” from Example 3) is foreshadowed here, linking his rage (“threatening to eat Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s head”) to the **destruction of sacred resources** in this passage. His anger is not merely paternal but a defense of *kuleana* (stewardship), a microcosm of colonial clashes between indigenous and imported systems of control.  \n• **Allegorical readings:**  \n– Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s physical fragility juxtaposed with his destructive act mirrors the tension between Hawaiian resilience and invasive threats (e.g., foreign diseases, technologies). The “pu‘e” (earth heap) and “lau ‘uala” (leaves) symbolize fertility disrupted, a metaphor for colonial erasure of *lōkāhi* (harmonious balance) in land and kinship.  \n– The children’s incomplete defiance (“‘a‘ohe huhuki i ka pu‘e”) may represent the intergenerational struggle to balance tradition with change—a common theme in post-‘Ai Kapu literature.",

  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
