  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.",

The mother looked at the daughter and replied: \"Oh, you are the beloved one of the blood and bones; you are not the one without blood and bones like my father.\" Pumaia said: \"What are you two whispering about?\" The mother answered: \"No, I was only speaking of our death; you are not the one without blood and bones.\" Pumaia said to the woman: \"Let us go; come with me.\" They departed from Pukoula toward the cold region of Pauoa, traveling until they reached the waters of Alekoki, then onward to Maemae. Thus they journeyed, crossing the vast sea of the morning, and finally arrived at Nuuanu. </translation>"
