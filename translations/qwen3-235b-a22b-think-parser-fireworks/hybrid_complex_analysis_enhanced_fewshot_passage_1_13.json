Because of this, you will kill us, and we will not survive.\" Nāmakaokapāoʻo said, \"Let's go down together to the lower land to speak.\" When they reached the lower land, Nāmakaokapāoʻo attacked and killed them all, except one man who escaped and fled to Waikīkī, where he found ʻAmaʻu and told him of their complete destruction, and ʻAmaʻu grieved.",

Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nNāmakaokapāoʻo said, \"I've heard that Nāmakaokapāoʻo is a great man, and he has gone to Koʻolau, and I am his name.\" They replied, \"No, you are indeed the one we've heard of.

By asserting he has gone to Koʻolau, Nāmakaokapāoʻo may allegorically claim divine authority or confront spiritual boundaries.  \n\n• The group’s fear and insistence that Nāmakaokapāoʻo will kill them (\"make ana 'oe iā mākou\") highlights:  \n– A cultural pattern of preemptively assigning violent outcomes in myths, often tied to *mana* (spiritual power) wars or breaches of *kapu* (restrictions). This mirrors earlier tensions with Pualiʻi, who sought to uphold *ʻAi Kapu* traditions.  \n– The refusal to accept dialogue (\"e hakakā ai\") and immediate assumption of death suggests rigid adherence to fatalistic narratives, contrasting with Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s proposal for resolution through speech.  \n\n• The massacre and escape to Waikīkī (a historically significant coastal region on Oʻahu) carry layered symbolism:  \n– The sole survivor fleeing to Waikīkī ('Awa of the sea') to inform ʻAmaʻu could symbolize the spread of knowledge or curses through oral transmission. In earlier eras, kūhikuhi (messengers) carried such news, often invoking rituals like *kīpa* (mourning chants) for the dead.  \n– The name ʻAmaʻu (A-maʻu: \"The unchanged\" or \"Everlasting\") might reference a guardian of traditions, given its root in *maʻu* (to endure). His mourning over the slaughter suggests a lament for disrupted cultural order, perhaps echoing the decline of chiefdoms during post-contact upheavals.  \n\n• Allegorical interpretations:  \n– Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s destruction of the group could allegorize the collapse of old *kapu* systems in favor of individual *mana* (as seen in Example 3’s critique of *ʻAi Kapu*), though here violence replaces ritual reform.  \n– The contrast between spoken resolution (\"hakakā\") and physical annihilation mirrors Hawaiian cosmogony’s duality: *lāʻau* (tree/growth) vs. *kiʻi* (image/statue) phases of existence, where dialogue fails, and transformation through death occurs.  \n– The number \"one escaping\" might tie to symbolic rebirth, as singular survivors in myths often initiate new lineages or eras—though here, *ʻAmaʻu’s* mourning complicates this hope.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I know. Nāmakaokapāo'o is a really big guy. He went to Ko'olau. I'm named after him.\" The soldiers said, \"No, it's you. That's what we heard. So, we're going to kill you. You won't survive.\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"Well, let's go down and fight.\" When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work and killed them all except one man, who ran off and reached 'Ama'u in Waikīkī. He told him about the how they were all killed except for one runner to go and tell 'Ama'u about it.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
