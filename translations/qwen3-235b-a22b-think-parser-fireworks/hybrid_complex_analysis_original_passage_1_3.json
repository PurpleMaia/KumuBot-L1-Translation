Puali‘i observed Pōka‘i and desired her, so he spoke to her: \"I desire you to be my wife.\" Pōka‘ī replied: \"How can you desire me? I have already borne a child, and my body has changed.\" Puali‘i responded: \"Those matters are unimportant; if you also desire me, we shall be together.\" Pōka‘ī agreed. And Pōka‘ī returned with her husband, Puali‘i, to the upland area of Keahumoa to dwell.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Cultural Context:**  \nThis passage reflects traditional Hawaiian norms around courtship, agency, and social relationships. The dialogue between Puali‘i and Pōka‘ī highlights a mutual exchange of consent, contrasting with the notion of arranged marriages (though arranged unions were common for aliʻi, commoners (kanaka) often had more autonomy in choosing partners). Pōka‘ī’s hesitation due to her status as a mother (\"ua hānau wau i ke keiki\") acknowledges the cultural emphasis on childbirth and physical transformation, yet Puali‘i’s reassurance (\"He mea ʻole ia mau mea\") underscores valuing character over physicality. The phrase *moe kāua* (literally \"to lie down together\") likely symbolizes a formal union, though its euphemistic nature mirrors Hawaiian oral traditions of indirect expression (*ʻōlelo noʻeau*) to discuss intimacy.  \n\n**Linguistic Features:**  \n- **Honorific markers** like *‘o* (e.g., *‘o Puali‘i*) emphasize proper names, a hallmark of Hawaiian syntax.  \n- **Spatial markers** (*i ka lawaiʻa ma kai*, *ma ka hale*) anchor the narrative in physical geography, common in Hawaiian literature to ground stories in tangible, ancestral landscapes.  \n- **Politeness and pragmatics:** The use of *ā* in *ā ke kula o Keahumoa* (connecting their union to a specific land parcel) ties relationships to kinship (*ʻohana*) and land tenure, central to Hawaiian identity.  \n- The verb *nānā* (to look/observe) frames Puali‘i’s desire as a considered, respectful courtship, not impulsive.  \n\n**Historical Significance:**  \n- **Place names** like Honouliuli (a historically fertile fishing ground on Oʻahu) and Keahumoa (a location in Kauaʻi) ground the narrative in real geography, emphasizing Hawaiians’ deep ties to ʻāina (land).  \n- The story’s inclusion of a woman (*Pōka‘ī*) articulating her bodily agency reflects nuanced pre-contact gender dynamics, countering reductive colonial narratives. Her acknowledgment of motherhood as a social concern aligns with Hawaiian values of *lōkahi* (harmony) between personal and communal roles.  \n- The phrase *me kāna kāne* (with her husband) suggests that Pōka‘ī may have been previously married or in a union, illustrating the fluidity of marriage structures in pre-colonial Hawaiʻi, where divorce and remarriage were socially accepted.  \n\nThis passage exemplifies how Hawaiian storytelling intertwines individual narratives with broader cultural values, using concise yet layered language to convey themes of desire, mutual respect, and ecological connection.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
