  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_translation": "While they were staying there, along came Puali‘i, a kind-hearted man from Līhu‘e, who was fishing off the coast of Honouliuli, and he came to visit at Poka‘i’s house. Puali‘i observed Poka‘i and felt a strong desire for her, so he said: “I desire you as my wife.” Poka‘i replied: “How could you desire me? I have given birth to a child, and my body has become unattractive.” Puali‘i responded: “Those things matter not—if you feel the same for me, we shall marry.” Poka‘i accepted, and Poka‘i and her husband (or male partner) and Puali‘i returned together to the plain of Keahumoa to live.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Cultural Context**  \n1. **Marriage Customs**:  \n   This passage reflects pre-colonial Hawaiian marriage practices, where mutual consent was central. Poka‘i’s initial hesitation—mentioning her prior childbirth and bodily changes—highlights traditional norms that sometimes idealized physical youthfulness, though fertility (as shown by her child) was also valued. Puali‘i’s dismissal of these concerns (“Those things matter not”) underscores the importance of emotional connection in matrimony, a recurring theme in *moʻolelo* (stories).  \n\n2. **Social Structure and Kinship**:  \n   The term *kāne* (“husband” or “male partner”) used for Poka‘i’s companion suggests non-stigmatization of multipartner unions or fluid partnerships in pre-contact Hawaii, though the text implies a formal marriage is being arranged. The mention of relocation to the plain of Keahumoa reflects *ʻohana* (family) units forming through alliances.  \n\n3. **Gender Roles**:  \n   Puali‘i (a man) initiates the proposal (“Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine naʻu”), but Poka‘i’s agency is evident in her direct dialogue and acceptance. Her concern about bodily changes from childbirth aligns with historical accounts of societal beauty standards, yet Puali‘i’s response emphasizes respect for lived experience over idealized youth.  \n\n**Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Honorific Grammar**:  \n   The narrative employs *kaʻi* (definite articles like *o* and *ka*) and *ʻōlelo hoʻoilo* (dialogic speech) with honorific plural pronouns (*kāua*, “we”) to convey formality. Phrases like “ʻī akula” (said he) use the suffix *-akula* to emphasize completed actions, a hallmark of 19th-century Hawaiian literature.  \n\n2. **Naming and Geography**:  \n   - *Pualiʻi* (“small cliff”) and *Pōkaʻi* (“small Pō”/minor chief) hint at ancestral connections, as proper names often alluded to natural features or familial rank.  \n   - Place names convey ecological and social significance:  \n     - *Līhuʻe* (present-day Kauaʻi) denotes a fertile *ahupuaʻa* (land division), fitting a fisherman’s context (*lawaiʻa ma kai*).  \n     - *Honouliuli* (“dark bay”) references a historically strategic coastal area, while *Keahumoa* (“quiet plain”) implies a settlement locale.  \n\n**Historical Significance**  \n1. **Fishing and Subsistence**:  \n   Puali‘i’s profession as a *lawaiʻa* (fisherman) underscores the centrality of marine resources in Native Hawaiian sustenance. Coastal fishing grounds like Honouliuli were vital for traded goods like *ʻamaʻama* (mullet), linking the narrative to economic practices.  \n\n2. **Oral Tradition Preservation**:  \n   The dialogue structure mirrors pre-literate Hawaiian storytelling, where propositional statements (*moe kāua*—“we shall marry”) and counterarguments were codified in literature. The text preserves a window into pre-Christian social norms, contrasting later colonial-era shifts toward Western marriage models.  \n\n3. **Interpersonal Agency**:  \n   Pokaʻi’s candid self-deprecation and choice (“Aʻe akula ‘o Pokaʻi”) reflect a society where women could negotiate marriage terms—a nuance often obscured in early Western accounts of Hawaiian women.  \n\n**Additional Notes**  \n- The phrase *Ke kula o Keahumoa* (“the plain of Keahumoa”) evokes *kula* lands as communal or agricultural spaces, positioning the couple within a subsistence-based economy.  \n- The narrative’s balance of earthy realism (“my body has become unattractive”) and lyrical resolution highlights the Hawaiian language’s capacity for emotional nuance without sentimentality.  \n- The presence of a child outside wedlock (*ua hānau wau i ke keiki*) reflects kinship structures that prioritized *ʻohana* over individual morality—a contrast to post-missionary erasure of pre-colonial family diversity.  \n\nThis passage serves as a microcosm of 19th-century Hawaiian literature’s role in codifying Indigenous values while adapting to new literary forms, offering a rare glimpse into personal dynamics shaped by kanaka agency and cultural continuity.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
