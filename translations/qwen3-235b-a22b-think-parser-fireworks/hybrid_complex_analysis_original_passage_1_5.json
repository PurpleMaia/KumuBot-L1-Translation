At that time, Namakaokapāoʻo's body was very weak—a full two and a half spans in height, his illness had not been cured, lingering still.

Namakaokapāoʻo’s lingering frailty (\"maʻi lewalewa\") suggests an ailment resistant to healing, which might have been attributed to supernatural causes, such as breaking a *kapu* (taboo) or displeasing *ʻaumakua* (ancestral deities). In Hawaiian cosmology, physical weakness could symbolize a loss of *mana* (spiritual power) or balance between the body and the natural world.  \n2. **Agriculture and Community Labor**: The cultivation of *ʻuala* (sweet potato) was central to Hawaiʻi’s subsistence economy. Children participating in agricultural tasks highlights the communal labor system (*kālaiʻāina*) and intergenerational knowledge transfer. However, the children’s fear and failure to follow Namakaokapāoʻo’s orders may allegorize the challenges of enforcing authority or the consequences of disharmony within a community.  \n3. **Mythological Allusions**: Namakaokapāoʻo’s name combines *Namaka* (a sea deity sister of Pele) and *kapāoʻo* (“to tremble” or “to shrink”), possibly marking him as a figure of vulnerability or liminality. His ambiguous state (“not paʻa kona maʻi”) may symbolize a supernatural being caught between worlds, a theme common in Hawaiian moʻolelo (stories).  \n\n**Linguistic Features**:  \n1. **Numerical Terminology**: The phrase “ʻumi kumamāhiku” (ten and seven) reflects the proto-Polynesian vigesimal (base-20) counting system modified for small numbers. Specific terms like *kumu* (root/cause) and *kapuaʻi* (span: the distance from thumb to little finger) demonstrate the embodied, tactile basis of traditional Hawaiian measurement systems.  \n2. **Imperatives and Agency**: The direct command *E huhuki i ka puʻe* (“dig up the mounds”) highlights the hierarchical relationship between elder and children. The refusal (*ʻaʻole huhuki*) and minimal action (*kāohi mālie*—“lightly scratched”) underscores disobedience, with semantic contrast reinforcing the children’s fear (*makaʻu*).  \n3. **Phonological Nuances**: The repetition of liquid consonants in *lewalewa* (twisting, dangling) and *kāohi mālie* (gently scraping) creates a musical, almost onomatopoeic effect, evoking the futility of the children’s labor.  \n\n**Historical Significance**:  \n1. **Agricultural Practices**: The mention of *māla ʻuala* (sweet potato fields) situates the narrative in pre-Contact Hawaiʻi, where *ʻuala* was second only to *kalo* (taro) in importance. The meticulous instruction to remove all foliage and mounds (to prevent regrowth) reflects traditional harvesting cycles and land management.  \n2. **Authorship and Oral Tradition**: This text likely originates from a *moʻolelo* (story) meant to explain natural phenomena or human behavior. Namakaokapāoʻo’s frailty and the children’s inaction may encode moral lessons about obedience, health, or ecological stewardship.  \n3. **Colonial and Medical Implications**: The phrase *maʻi lewalewa* (illness floating) contrasts with biomedical models of disease, illustrating the holistic Hawaiian understanding of health as intertwined with environment, lineage, and spiritual harmony. This worldview was marginalized under Western colonization but has gained renewed recognition in contemporary Indigenous revitalization movements.  \n\n**Scholarly Debates**:  \nSome scholars argue that figures like Namakaokapāoʻo might represent metaphorical embodiments of climate events (e.g., drought) or social strife, while others see them as etiological tales explaining the origins of certain practices. The incomplete harvesting described here could mythologically justify poor agricultural yields, linking human behavior to divine whims.  \n\nThis passage exemplifies how Hawaiian narratives encode history, ethics, and cosmology within layered linguistic and metaphorical frameworks, offering insights into the lived realities and values of āina (land)-based communities.",
  "reference_translation": "When Puali‘i left to go fishing, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  came with seventeen other children to the sweet  potato patches of Puali‘i. The body of   Nāmakaokapāo‘o at the time was very small, just  two and a half feet tall. His penis was not yet fully  grown and was dangling. When the kids got to the   sweet potato patches, Nāmakaokapāo‘o told the  other kids, “Rip out all of the sweet potato leaves. Don’t leave anything growing.” The children were  afraid and hesitated when they reached the  tubers, and they did not pull those out of the  mound.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 5:**• While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
