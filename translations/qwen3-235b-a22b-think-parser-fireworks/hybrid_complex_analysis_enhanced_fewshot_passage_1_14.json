  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \n\"At this time, Amaʻu, upon hearing [the news], hastily prepared ten and eight (18) war canoes for himself and sailed downstream to ʻEwa to wage battle against Nāmakaokapāoʻo. When Amaʻu and his people arrived at ʻEwa, they found Nāmakaokapāoʻo already waiting, utterly destroying the warriors, declaring ʻThere is no man among you,ʻ and Amaʻu soon perished. All of Oʻahu fell under Nāmakaokapāoʻoʻs control, and later, he retrieved his mother and seated her atop this land of Oʻahu.\"  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n**Paragraph 14:**  \n• **Narrative progression and warrior culture** – This passage accelerates the conflict between Nāmakaokapāoʻo and external challengers, reflecting traditional motifs of heroic invincibility and territorial consolidation. The number \"ten and eight\" (ʻumi kumamāwalu) war canoes (18 total) likely holds ritual significance. In Hawaiian cosmology, the number 18 (ʻumi kumamāwalu) may symbolize completeness or militarized power, combining ʻumi (10, symbolizing divine authority) and walu (8, linked to Kanaloa, god of the sea).  \n• **Name etymologies** –  \n– **Amaʻu** (*a-maʻu*, \"the gathered\" or \"the defiant\") possibly alludes to his role as a challenger to Nāmakaokapāoʻoʻs rising dominance. The name may evoke *ʻamaʻu*, a fern (*Cibotium glaucum*), symbolizing resilience in harsh environments.  \n– **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo** (*the eyes of the pāoʻo fish*) reinforces his supernatural potency. The *pāoʻo* (a spiney-finned fish) embodies vigilance and aggression, aligning with his predatory defeat of Amaʻu’s forces.  \n• **Strategic geography** – The battle at ʻEwa, a region adjacent to major *heiau* (temples) like Puʻu o Mahuka (near Laʻie), situates the conflict within sacred landscape politics. Control of ʻEwa—a coastal zone tied to long-distance canoe voyages and *loko iʻa* (fishponds)—cements Nāmakaokapāoʻoʻs economic and spiritual authority.  \n• **Allusions to 'Ai Kapu** –  \n– The declaration **ʻaʻohe kanaka koe** (\"there is no man among you\") echoes pre-'Ai Kapu warrior ethos, where female deities like Kanaloa or Hina were excluded from war leadership. By defeating male opponents, Nāmakaokapāoʻo asserts his hereditary right to rule, paralleling historical *aliʻi* consolidating power through combat.  \n– **Encircling Oʻahu** (*puni aʻela o Oʻahu*) and seating his mother on the land (*hoʻonoho i luna o ka ʻāina Oʻahu*) may symbolize a reconfiguration of sacred sovereignty. In pre-contact Hawaii, a *makuahine* (mother) often carried *mana* (spiritual power) through matrilineage. By elevating her, Nāmakaokapāoʻo intertwines his rule with maternal mana, subverting the patrilineal emphasis of later 'Ai Kapu practices.  \n• **Allegorical shifts** – Amaʻu’s death and Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s territorial expansion allegorize the tension between localized *mōʻī* (chiefs) and itinerant *kāula* (prophet-heroes). Nāmakaokapāoʻo, as a demigod (part human, part divine), embodies a transitional figure who transcends human limitations, akin to Pele or Māui. His dominance over Oʻahu foreshadows later narratives where supernatural beings shape the land—a metaphor for ecological or political transformation.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
