When they arrived at the field of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but found no one there. As they prepared to return, Namakaokapāʻo called out from atop the ridge. They heard the voice but saw no body, and they asked, \"Who speaks here?\" Namakaokapāʻo replied, \"It is I who am here above.\" Eight men immediately climbed up, four on the back of the house and four on the front, and they seized Namakaokapāʻo. He asked them, \"Why have you come here today?\" They answered, \"We have come to fight Namakaokapāʻo, a mere child, a strong and brave one who killed his own father, Pualiʻi.\"",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nThen Ama'u, the chief from Waikīkī, sent four warrior groups, one of which numbered eighteen people, and so it was for all four groups. When they arrived at the field of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but found no one there. As they prepared to return, Namakaokapāʻo called out from atop the ridge.

The text exemplifies the episodic structure of Indigenous storytelling, where action-driven scenes and dialogue advance themes of kinship conflict, martial prowess, and the supernatural. Namakaokapāʻo (\"Namaka the Brave\") appears here as a paradoxical figure—a young, formidable warrior accused of patricide, a grave violation of kapu (sacred law). The mention of Waikīkī and Keahumoa grounds the tale in specific landscapes, reflecting the deep connection between Hawaiian narratives and geography. The scene’s dramatic tension—unseen voices, strategic combat, and confrontational dialogue—highlights oral storytelling’s performative qualities, designed to engage listeners while encoding cultural values and historical memory.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Chief 'Ama'u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the house, but no one was there. When they were ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo'o called out from on top of the roof. They heard the voice, but didn't see any body, and they asked, \"Where is that voice coming from?\" Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"I'm up here.\" Eight men climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four on the face of the house and got a hold of Nāmakaokapāo'o. Nāmakaokapāo'o said, \"What in the world are you all doing here?\" They said, \"We came to fight Nāmakaokapāo'o, a little boy like you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his father, Puali'i.\"",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
