After the mother had stayed there, she returned with them to their house at Keahumoa, where she resided. Namakaokapaao climbed atop the ridgepole of the house, tore away the thatch from the back and front, and lay across the top of the ridgepole itself.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nThen he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. After the mother had stayed there, she returned with them to their house at Keahumoa, where she resided. Namakaokapaao climbed atop the ridgepole of the house, tore away the thatch from the back and front, and lay across the top of the ridgepole itself.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a foundational narrative segment in the moʻolelo (Hawaiian story) introducing the dynamics between supernatural beings and kinship ties central to the legend of Pele (the deity of volcanoes) and her family. The text reveals the tension between mortal and divine realms: the protagonist (fleeing a threat) seeks refuge with family while another figure, Namakaokapāoʻo (often linked to Namaka, Pele’s sorceress sister), uses supernatural strength to locate or confront them. The mention of specific places like Waipouli (a valley in Kauaʻi) and Keahumoa (a district on Kauaʻi) grounds the myth in the physical geography of Hawaiʻi, a common feature of oral traditions that connect ancestral stories to land. The imagery of tearing thatch and climbing rooftops reflects the raw power of these deities, traits emphasized in chants and mele (songs) about primordial forces.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
