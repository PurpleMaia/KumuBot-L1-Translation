But the mother disappeared, so the child returned to their house in Keahumoa and lived there. Namakaokapaʻoʻo climbed to the peak of the house, tore away the thatching on the back and front, and slept down upon the ridgepole.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nThen she took her child to hide in the cave of Waihouli. But the mother disappeared, so the child returned to their house in Keahumoa and lived there. Namakaokapaʻoʻo climbed to the peak of the house, tore away the thatching on the back and front, and slept down upon the ridgepole.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\nThis passage is part of a mytho-historical narrative in the epic cycle of Namakaokapaʻoʻo, a figure central to early Hawaiian oral traditions. The story aligns with Polynesian themes of exile, reintegration, and supernatural recognition. The cave of Waihouli (spelled with variant geography in different manuscripts) serves as a pivotal location in Kauaʻi's legendary landscape. The imagery of removing roof thatching to access a sacred space relates to traditional hale architecture and spiritual practices, while the ridgepole (kaupoku) symbolizes lineage connection in Hawaiian cosmology—a key motif for a demigod validating descent. This section precedes Namakaokapaʻoʻo's dramatic recognition of his kinship with the child, reflecting the narrative structure of many Hawaiian moʻolelo where revelations follow persistent, symbolic physical quests.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
