Upon 'Ama'u's arrival at 'Ewa with his people, Nāmakaokapāo'o confronted him, declaring him utterly defeated and saying, \"You are no man,\" and so 'Ama'u perished. Thus, Nāmakaokapāo'o gained full control of O'ahu, and thereafter, he took his mother and placed her to rule over the land of O'ahu.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nWhen 'Ama'u heard this, he immediately prepared his war canoes, numbering eighteen, and sailed down to 'Ewa to wage battle against Nāmakaokapāo'o. Upon 'Ama'u's arrival at 'Ewa with his people, Nāmakaokapāo'o confronted him, declaring him utterly defeated and saying, \"You are no man,\" and so 'Ama'u perished. Thus, Nāmakaokapāo'o gained full control of O'ahu, and thereafter, he took his mother and placed her to rule over the land of O'ahu.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\nThis passage is part of a larger mythological or historical narrative chronicling inter-island conflicts and the rise of powerful rulers in pre-contact Hawaiʻi. The text reflects traditional Hawaiian literary conventions, including vivid descriptions of warfare, genealogical legitimacy, and the symbolic transfer of authority. The figure Nāmakaokapāoʻo (whose name translates to \"The-Eye-of-the-Devourer\") appears in multiple traditions as a formidable warrior or supernatural being associated with Oʻahu. The mention of 'Ama'u's defeat and the installation of Nāmakaokapāoʻo's mother as ruler highlights the intersection of martial prowess and matrilineal authority in Hawaiian leadership structures. This account likely originates from a longer epic cycle, possibly connected to the traditions of the Māui brothers or the genealogies of Oʻahu's ruling chiefs, serving to legitimize political dominance through ancestral deeds and divine sanction.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
