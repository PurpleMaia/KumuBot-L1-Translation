Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nThen, he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. When the mother was gone, he returned to their home in Keahumoa and resided there. Nāmakaokapāoʻo then climbed onto the rooftop, tore away the thatching on the back and front sections, and lay down directly atop the ridgepole.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n**Paragraph 11:**  \n• The **cave at Waipouli** (wailepo + li, \"cascading water's dark place\") is a motif tied to refuge and survival in Hawaiian narratives. Caves were often *heiau* (temples) or spiritual sanctuaries (*Pukui et al., Place Names of Hawaii*). By hiding Pōkaʻī here, Nāmakaokapāoʻo implies her need for *hoʻomaha* (safety) from Pualiʻi’s threat to kill him, reinforcing the narrative’s tension between generational conflict and defiance of *ʻai kapu* norms.  \n• Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s return home without his mother may symbolize his transition to independent agency. His abandonment of maternal protection mirrors the mythic *pākī* (sibling rivalry) archetype, common in *moʻolelo Hawaiʻi* (Hawaiian stories), where youths confront parental figures to claim status.  \n• **Climbing the rooftop**:  \n– The act of ascending to the *kaupoku* (ridgepole) situates him in a liminal space between *lani* (celestial realm) and *honua* (earthly realm), a position reserved for *kāhuna* (priestly experts) or *aliʻi* (chiefs) in ritual contexts.  \n– Removing the *mataʻu o ke kua a me ke alo* (back and front sections of the thatching) subversively dismantles the house’s spiritual boundaries (*pākīkī*). In *ʻai kapu*, houses were symbolic of social order; tearing the thatch critiques patriarchal dominance (*Pukui 1972:147*, citing *ʻai nohoʻs* role in domestic *kapu* enforcement).  \n– **Sleeping atop the ridgepole**:  \n— This action defies *ʻai kapu* norms, as the ridgepole was regarded as the *koʻa* (sacred cornerstone) of a home. By reclining here, Nāmakaokapāoʻo enacts symbolic usurpation of Pualiʻi’s role as *makua kāne* (stepfather/leading man).  \n— The ridgepole (*kaupoku*) may allegorize the metaphysical spine of *Kahiki* (ancestral homeland), linking his defiance to broader mythic voyages of demigods like Kāne and Kanaloa, who reshaped the world by confronting divine forces (*Kamakau 1869:16*).  \n• **Etymological motifs**:  \n– *Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo* (\"the eyes of the pāoʻo fish\") echoes *pāoʻo* (to stiffen, endure), symbolized here by his rigid, unyielding posture on the ridgepole. The fish’s \"eyes\" grant clairvoyance in Polynesian lore, suggesting his vigilance in anticipating Pualiʻi’s return.  \n– *Waipouli* (dark waters) and *Keahumoa* (everlasting foodheap) juxtapose themes of concealment vs. sustenance, framing the cave and plains as opposing arenas for survival amid familial strife.  \n• **Allegorical implications**:  \n– The house becomes a microcosm of *ʻai kapu* itself. By violating its sanctity, Nāmakaokapāoʻo prefigures the breaking of taboos (e.g., Kamehameha II’s ʻai noa, 1819). This act parallels later historic movements rejecting rigid hierarchy, echoing the child-demigod’s impatience with adult mores.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
