  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \n\"Then, he took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. And when the mother was abandoned, he returned to their house in Keahumoa and lived there. Then, Nāmakaokapāoʻo climbed up to the ridgepole of the house, split open the roof and the face, and slept directly atop the ridgepole.\"  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \n**Paragraph 11:**  \n• The narrative context centers on **Nāmakaokapāoʻo’s abrupt shift to betrayal and violence**, escalating tensions between him and his family:  \n– *Hiding the mother in the cave* (WAIPOLULI, \"water that falls into darkness\") reflects **traditional practices of seeking refuge in times of conflict or omens**, though here it signals violation, as caves often symbolized sanctuary (*pō* = night/ancestral realm).  \n– *Abandoning the mother* (Pōkaʻī) aligns with **patrilocal postmarital residence patterns**, but the callousness subverts **Hawaiian values of maternal kinship** (*ʻohana hanau*).  \n\n• **Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo** (“The Eyes of the *Pāoʻo* [fish]”) enacts symbolic desecration:  \n– Climbing to the *kaupoku* (ridgepole) **breaches the spiritual heart of the house** (*ʻano piko*), where ancestral prayers resided.  \n– *Splitting the roof and face* (*kua* = back, *alo* = front) destroys the house’s structural integrity, paralleling the **collapse of kinship bonds** and *ʻai kapu* order.  \n– Sleeping on the ridgepole represents **usurping ancestral authority**, literally claiming spiritual high ground to assert dominance, akin to *aliʻi* asserting power over land (*ʻāina*).  \n\n• **Allegorical implications** tie to **pre-contact power struggles**:  \n– The house’s destruction mirrors the dismantling of *ʻai kapu* taboos (e.g., prior example’s ulua substitution).  \n– Nā-maka-o-ka-pāoʻo’s physical domination of sacred space (\"sleeping atop the ridgepole\") evokes **mythological motifs of gods establishing sovereignty** (e.g., Pele’s occupation of Kīlauea).  \n– The return to Keahumoa (\"feeding heap\") may satirize *seasonal fertility rituals*, as the land’s name links to abundance (*moʻo* = heap/multiply), now tainted by the protagonist’s defiance.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
