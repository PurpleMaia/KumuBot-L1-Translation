Namakaokapāoʻo climbed up onto the roof of the house, parted the thatch of the roof and the front section, and lay down in the center atop the roof.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>\nThen, he took his mother to hide in the cave of Waipouli. The mother remained, and he returned to their house in Keahumoa, where he lived. Namakaokapāoʻo climbed up onto the roof of the house, parted the thatch of the roof and the front section, and lay down in the center atop the roof.\n</translation>\n\n<commentary>\nThis passage is part of a larger mythological narrative from Hawaiian oral tradition, specifically from the story of Namakaokapāoʻo, a supernatural being associated with healing and the sea. The text describes key actions in his journey, including the concealment of his mother in a cave (Waipouli, a real location on Kauaʻi) and his return to Keahumoa (a place on Oʻahu). The act of climbing and altering the roof structure reflects ritualistic or symbolic behavior, common in Hawaiian moʻolelo (stories) to signify spiritual power or liminality. The passage serves as a transitional segment, bridging earlier events with subsequent developments in the narrative, which often involve encounters with deities or supernatural challenges.\n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
