  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_translation": "Amau heard the news, immediately preparing ten plus eight war canoes, then sailing down to Ewa to fight Namakaokapao'o. When Amau and his people reached Ewa, Namakaokapao'o ambushed and utterly routed them, declaring there was no match for them, resulting in Amau's death. Thus, the island of Oahu came entirely under Namakaokapao'o's control. Thereafter, he took his mother and installed her as ruler over the island of Oahu.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nAmau heard the news, immediately preparing ten plus eight war canoes, then sailing down to Ewa to fight Namakaokapao'o. When Amau and his people reached Ewa, Namakaokapao'o ambushed and utterly routed them, declaring there was no match for them, resulting in Amau's death. Thus, the island of Oahu came entirely under Namakaokapao'o's control. Thereafter, he took his mother and installed her as ruler over the island of Oahu.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a mytho-historical narrative chronicling the exploits of Namakaokapao'o, a primordial mo'o (dragon or guardian) figure linked to Oʻahu's spiritual and political origins. The text exemplifies traditional Hawaiian prose structure, marked by concise chronology, numerical specificity (ʻumi kumamāwalu = 18 war canoes), and symbolic acts of conquest. Linguistically, the use of \"ho'omākaukau ihola\" (immediately prepared) underscores the urgency of battle, while \"puni aʻela\" (entirely surrounded) reflects the consolidation of power. Cultural practices such as matrilineal leadership transfer (\"ho'onoho ihola i luna o ka ʻāina\") highlight indigenous governance models. Historically, these stories interweave genealogical claims with cosmological themes, illustrating the interconnectedness of divine authority, warfare, and land stewardship in pre-contact Hawaii.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
