  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_translation": "Ama'u heard [the challenge], and immediately prepared his war canoes, numbering eighteen, then sailed down to Ewa to do battle with Namakaokapāo'o. When Ama'u and his people reached Ewa, Namakaokapāo'o ambushed them utterly, declaring \"There is no man left,\" and Ama'u was slain. Thus, O'ahu was seized by Namakaokapāo'o, and then he took his mother and placed her to rule over the land of O'ahu.",
  "qwen3-235b-a22b-think-parser-fireworks_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nAma'u heard [the challenge], and immediately prepared his war canoes, numbering eighteen, then sailed down to Ewa to do battle with Namakaokapāo'o. When Ama'u and his people reached Ewa, Namakaokapāo'o ambushed them utterly, declaring \"There is no man left,\" and Ama'u was slain. Thus, O'ahu was seized by Namakaokapāo'o, and then he took his mother and placed her to rule over the land of O'ahu.  \n</translation>  \n\n</translation>  \n\n</commentary>  \nThis passage belongs to a traditional Hawaiian mele or epic narrative recounting inter-island conflicts and genealogical transitions of power. It occurs early in the story, establishing the prowess of Namakaokapāo'o (a sea deity or *moʻo* guardian in some traditions) through military conquest and strategic displacement of rivals. The narrative combines historical motifs—war canoe warfare, territorial dominance—and mythic elements, such as Namakaokapāo'o’s supernatural capacities. The displacement of Ama'u and enthroning of the invader’s mother on O'ahu reflects Polynesian cosmological ties between land, lineage, and divine authority, while the number \"eighteen\" (ʻumi kumamāwalu) may symbolize completeness or spiritual potency in traditional numerology.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
