  "qwen3-4b-awq-40k-maui_translation": "Let us go to the chief of Waikīkī, for four of us are the people, and the rest of the four are all. They went to the school of Keahumoa, and they went to the house, but there were no people. They spoke, and from Nāmakaokapāo‘o came in the moon of the body. They heard the voice, \"Are you alive?\" Nāmakaokapāo‘o replied, \"Yes, in the moon.\" Then they were told that Nāmakaokapāo‘o is the one who is the one. Nāmakaokapāo‘o asked, \"Where are you from?\" They replied, \"We came with Nāmakaokapāo‘o, we are like him, we are the ones, and our father is Puali‘i.\"",
  "qwen3-4b-awq-40k-maui_commentary": "This passage is a narrative excerpt from a historical or traditional Hawaiian text, likely from a book like *The Book of the People* (a 19th-century Hawaiian-language text by Kamehameha the Great). It reflects the cultural, linguistic, and social dynamics of Hawaiian society, particularly the hierarchical structure of the *ali‘i* (chief) and the use of Hawaiian terms to describe lineage, identity, and spiritual concepts.  \n\n### **Cultural Context**  \n1. **Hierarchy and Lineage**: The text emphasizes the *ali‘i* (chief) as a central figure, reflecting the Hawaiian social structure where chiefs (or *ali‘i*) held authority over communities. The mention of \"Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" (a proper noun) and \"Puali‘i\" (a father figure) underscores the importance of *kūkū* (lineage) and *mākāhia* (ancestry) in Hawaiian identity. The phrase \"he wahi keiki ‘u‘uku e like me ‘oe\" (a place where the child is like us) highlights the cultural emphasis on kinship and shared identity.  \n\n2. **Spiritual and Cosmic Imagery**: The reference to \"luna o kaupoku\" (moon of the body) and \"wala‘au\" (alive) reflects Hawaiian cosmology, where the moon is often associated with the body (e.g., the *kāhuna* or spiritual leader) and the concept of *wala‘au* (life) is tied to the *kāne* (male lineage). The phrase \"he ikaika a me ke koa loa\" (a type of fish and a large object) may allude to symbolic elements in Hawaiian culture, such as the *ika* (fish) as a metaphor for life or the *koa* (a tree) as a symbol of strength.  \n\n3. **Social Interaction**: The dialogue between the speaker and Nāmakaokapāo‘o illustrates the formal and respectful manner in which Hawaiians addressed elders or chiefs. The use of \"he aha mai nei kā ‘oukou o ‘one‘i\" (where are you from?) and \"kona makua kāne\" (your father) reflects the importance of *mākāhia* (ancestry) in Hawaiian social interactions.  \n\n### **Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Syntax and Structure**: The passage uses a complex, narrative syntax with embedded clauses (e.g., \"a hiki lākou ma ke kula o Keahumoa\" – \"they went to the school of Keahumoa\"). The use of *ma* (to, at) and *kā* (the) to denote locations (e.g., \"ma ke kula\" – \"to the school\") is characteristic of Hawaiian grammar.  \n\n2. **Vocabulary**:  \n   - **\"Ali‘i\"**: Refers to a chief or ruler, emphasizing the hierarchical structure of Hawaiian society.  \n   - **\"Kānaka\"**: Means \"people\" or \"individual,\" often used in the context of communal or collective identity.  \n   - **\"Kāpū\"**: The term \"kāpū\" (prohibited) is not explicitly used here, but the phrase \"kāhea mai ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" (from Nāmakaokapāo‘o) suggests a connection to a specific lineage or title.  \n   - **\"Luna\"**: Refers to the moon, a central symbol in Hawaiian culture, often linked to the *kāne* (male lineage) or the *kāne* (male ancestor).  \n\n3. **Proper Nouns**: The names \"Nāmakaokapāo‘o\" and \"Puali‘i\" are likely proper nouns, possibly referring to historical or legendary figures. The use of these names in the text underscores the importance of *mākāhia* (lineage) in Hawaiian identity.  \n\n### **Historical Significance**  \nThis passage is likely from a text that documents the *mākāhia* (lineage) of the *ali‘i* (chiefs) of the Hawaiian Islands, particularly in the context of the 19th century when Kamehameha the Great was compiling a historical record. The mention of \"Waikīkī\" (a reference to the capital of Hawaii) and \"Keahumoa\" (a possible historical figure) suggests a narrative about the *ali‘i* and their interactions with the people. The text may also reflect the *pūnana lēnua* (local schools) and *hale* (houses) as spaces of learning and socialization, which were central to Hawaiian culture.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis passage is a rich example of Hawaiian cultural and linguistic expression, blending historical narrative, spiritual symbolism, and social hierarchy. It reflects the importance of *mākāhia* (lineage), the role of the *ali‘i*, and the use of Hawaiian terms to describe identity, community, and the cosmos. The text serves as a window into the values and structures of Hawaiian society, particularly in the context of the 19th century.",

  "reference_translation": "Chief ‘Ama‘u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they  reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the  house, but no one was there. When they were  ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  called out from on top of the roof. They heard the  voice, but didn’t see any body, and they asked,  “Where is that voice coming from?”   Nāmakaokapāo‘o said, “I‘m up here.” Eight men  climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four  on the face of the house and got a hold of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Nāmakaokapāo‘o said, “What in  the world are you all doing here?” They said, “We  came to fight Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a little boy like  you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his  father, Puali‘i.”"
