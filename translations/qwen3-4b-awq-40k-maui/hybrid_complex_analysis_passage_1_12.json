  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nThe chief of Waikīkī, after four days, went to the large place where the people in charge are. Then, they went to the school of Keahumoa, and they went to the house, where there were no people. They were told, \"From Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the moon of the land.\" They listened to the word, \"There is no knowledge of the spirit, but we are: 'Are you alive?' Nāmakaokapāo‘o said: 'Yes, in this moon.' Then, the people, four in the house, four in the house, the one who is the one of Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Nāmakaokapāo‘o said: 'Where are you from?' The people said: 'We came from here, we are like you, we are fish, we are trees, we are the ones who spoke to our ancestors, Puali‘i.'  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is a complex narrative from a Hawaiian oral tradition, reflecting the cultural, historical, and linguistic richness of the Hawaiian language and society. Here’s a detailed breakdown:  \n\n### **Cultural Context**  \n1. **Hierarchical Structure**: The term *ke ali‘i* (\"the chief\") underscores the Hawaiian social hierarchy, where chiefs (ali‘i) held authority over land, people, and spiritual matters. The passage references a chief from Waikīkī, a historically significant area in Hawaii, emphasizing the chief’s role in governance and lineage.  \n2. **Ancestral Lineage**: The mention of *Puali‘i* (a name likely tied to a specific ancestor or lineage) highlights the importance of genealogy in Hawaiian culture. Ancestors (*makua*) are revered as spiritual and cultural guides, linking the present to the past through oral tradition.  \n3. **Sacred Spaces**: The reference to *luna* (\"moon\") and *kaupoku* (\"land\") suggests a spiritual or sacred context. The \"moon of the land\" (luna o kaupoku) may allude to a sacred place or a metaphorical \"spiritual realm,\" reflecting Hawaiian cosmology where natural elements are imbued with spiritual significance.  \n\n### **Historical Significance**  \n1. **Royal Lineage and Migration**: The passage describes a journey involving a chief and a figure named *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*, who is described as \"the one of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.\" This could reference a historical event or myth involving a royal migration, where a chief or leader interacts with a spiritual or ancestral figure.  \n2. **Oral Tradition and Storytelling**: The use of dialogue (*\"Are you alive?\"* and *“Yes, in this moon”*) and repetition of numbers (*ehā* = four) reflects the oral storytelling practices of Hawaiian culture, where narratives are structured to emphasize key moments and spiritual or historical truths.  \n\n### **Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Wordplay and Metaphor**: The phrase *“he wahi keiki ‘u‘uku e like me ‘oe”* (\"a place where children are like you\") uses metaphor to describe shared identity or spiritual kinship. The term *ikaika* (\"fish\") and *koa* (\"tree\") are symbolic, representing the interconnectedness of life and the natural world.  \n2. **Syntax and Rhythm**: The passage employs a rhythmic, poetic structure with short, declarative sentences and repetition (*ehā ma ke kua... ehā ma ke alo...*), which mirrors the cadence of Hawaiian oral traditions.  \n3. **Cultural Terminology**: Terms like *kumamāwalu* (\"to be in charge\") and *kānaka* (\"people\") reflect the social and political roles in Hawaiian society, while *kāhea* (\"from\") and *kāhea mai* (\"from where\") emphasize the fluidity of identity and belonging.  \n\n### **Symbolism and Themes**  \n- **Spiritual Connection**: The phrase *“nīnau aku lākou: ‘Auhea ‘oe e wala‘au nei?’”* (\"We are: 'Are you alive?')” suggests a spiritual or existential inquiry, possibly referencing the soul’s connection to the physical world.  \n- **Ancestral Guidance**: The reference to *Puali‘i* as an ancestor underscores the role of ancestors in guiding present-day individuals, a central theme in Hawaiian spirituality.  \n- **Unity and Identity**: The line *“he wahi keiki ‘u‘uku e like me ‘oe”* (\"a place where children are like you\") emphasizes communal identity and the shared experience of being part of a lineage or community.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis passage is a vivid example of Hawaiian oral storytelling, blending historical, spiritual, and social elements. It reflects the deep interconnection between the physical and spiritual worlds, the importance of lineage, and the structured yet fluid nature of Hawaiian society. The use of Hawaiian terms and narrative techniques underscores the cultural significance of language in preserving history, identity, and spiritual beliefs.",
  "reference_translation": "Chief ‘Ama‘u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they  reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the  house, but no one was there. When they were  ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  called out from on top of the roof. They heard the  voice, but didn’t see any body, and they asked,  “Where is that voice coming from?”   Nāmakaokapāo‘o said, “I‘m up here.” Eight men  climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four  on the face of the house and got a hold of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Nāmakaokapāo‘o said, “What in  the world are you all doing here?” They said, “We  came to fight Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a little boy like  you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his  father, Puali‘i.”"
