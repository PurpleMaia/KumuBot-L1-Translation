The text describes her role as a descendant of a chief (‘ama‘u) and her relationship with the chief (‘alii). The mention of “ho‘oweli ‘o ia e ‘oki i ke po‘o o ke keiki” (the child is born) and “ho‘ouna ‘ama‘u, ke alii” (the chief and the chief) highlights the social hierarchy and the importance of lineage in Hawaiian society. The use of “mō‘ī” (a term of endearment or respect) underscores the cultural emphasis on familial bonds and respect for elders.  \n\n**Paragraph 2:**  \nThis passage details the lineage of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, her ancestors, and her status as a chief’s daughter. The names “Kahikipapaialewa” and “Kahikinu‘u” refer to specific places or lineages, reflecting the historical and geographical context of the story. The mention of “makuahine” (female ancestor) and “ali‘i nui” (great chief) underscores the importance of lineage and titles in Hawaiian society. The text also emphasizes the role of the chief’s family in maintaining social order and cultural traditions.  \n\n**Paragraph 3:**  \nThis passage describes the birth and upbringing of Pōka‘ī, the daughter of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.

    "Nāmakaokapāo‘o was a little boy and incredibly  strong when he was very young. There was no one  like him from Hawai‘i all the way to Ni‘ihau in his  small stature and bravery. Kauluakaha‘i was his  father from Kahikipapaialewa, a place in  Kahikinu‘u. Pōka‘ī was his mother. His father was a  high chief of Kahikipapaialewa, who was also part  god.",
    "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty.",
    "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
    "They lived there and farmed, and Puali‘i had two  long sweet potato patches that remain until today,  and the patches were given the name,   Nāmakaokapāo‘o until today. When the sweet  potatoes were mature, Puali‘i said made a  promise, saying, “I’ll cook the head of an ulua fish  in the imu along with some sweet potatoes. When  Puali‘i eats, then the food will be made free for his  woman, Pōka‘ī, and anyone else.” So, Puali‘i went  down to the shore of Honouliuli to fish for a catch  to eat with sweet potatoes.",
    "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
    "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
    "(Here, I’ll talk a little about those two names,  Nāmakaokalani and Nāmakaokai‘a, which are  names of high chiefs of Hawai‘i. Nāmakaokalani  was the father and Nāmakaokai‘a was the son, but  these names were mentioned in the prayer of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o.)",
    "When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.",
    "When Puali‘i died, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back  to his mother, Pōka‘ī, and the two lived together,  but Nāmakaokapāo‘o had nothing to eat. At that  time, ‘Ama‘u was a chief of O‘ahu in Waikīkī,  where he lived. A man of Honouliuli came to Waikīkī, where the chief was found. The man said,  “Chief, there is a little boy who is amazingly strong.  He killed his father and threw his head in the  ocean a really long distance away, five miles off.”  When ‘Ama‘u heard this, he said, “We’ll see how  strong he is if he kills me. But if he doesn’t kill me,  he isn’t strong at all.” When he said this in Waikīkī,  Nāmakaokapāo‘o heard what he was saying about  him.",
    "Nāmakaokapāo‘o then took his mother to hide  her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was  well hidden, he went back to their house in  Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo‘o  climbed up onto the roof of the house and took  apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face  and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
    "Chief ‘Ama‘u sent four regiments of soldiers from Waikīkī totalling forty-eight men. When they  reached the plains of Keahumoa, they entered the  house, but no one was there. When they were  ready to return back to Waikīkī, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  called out from on top of the roof. They heard the  voice, but didn’t see any body, and they asked,  “Where is that voice coming from?”   Nāmakaokapāo‘o said, “I‘m up here.” Eight men  climbed up, four men went onto the roof and four  on the face of the house and got a hold of  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Nāmakaokapāo‘o said, “What in  the world are you all doing here?” They said, “We  came to fight Nāmakaokapāo‘o, a little boy like  you, who is really strong and brave. He killed his  father, Puali‘i.”",
    "Nāmakaokapāo‘o said, “I know.   Nāmakaokapāo‘o is a really big guy. He went to  Ko‘olau. Iʻm named after him.” The soldiers said,  “No, it’s you. That’s what we heard. So, we’re  going to kill you. You won’t survive.”   Nāmakaokapāo‘o said, “Well, let’s go down and  fight.” When they got down, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  went to work and killed them all except one man,  who ran off and reached ‘Ama‘u in Waikīkī. He told  him about the how they were all killed except for  one runner to go and tell ‘Ama‘u about it.  THE DEATH OF ‘AMA‘U",
    "When ‘Ama‘u heard about it, he prepared  eighteen of his war canoes and went over to ‘Ewa  to make war with Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When ‘Ama‘u  reached ‘Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went  to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is  how ‘Ama‘u died. All of O‘ahu fell to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Then he went and got his  mother and set her up as ruler over all of O‘ahu."

  "reference_commentary": "• Typically, 19th-century Hawaiian literary conventions  include using a) Roman numerals for chapter  numbers and b) a chapter summary up front. Both of  these conventions follow those used in English and  Hawaiian versions of the *Holy Bible* (*Baibala  Hemolele*).  **Paragraph 1:**  • It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;  **Paragraph 2:**  • Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  **Paragraph 3:**  • A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;  **Paragraph 4:**  • Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’; **Paragraph 5:**  • While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;",
  "reference_summary": "Two key references in this story help the reader understand the temporal context of the backstory. The first is the location and name of the two sweet potato  patches, ʻNā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o,’ in Keahumoa in Līhu‘e in Wāhiāwā on O‘ahu, which were known at the time of the publication of this story in the first decade  of the 20th century. The second reference is the negative view of the ‘Ai Kapu era, which ended in 1819, including all aspects of ‘Ai Kapu culture in place  across Hawai‘i for centuries prior to that year. Recognition of the ‘Ai Kapu in this story is understood from an examination of the text. The question that  remains is whether this story was invented in the 19th century as a post-‘Ai Kapu, pro-Christian narrative justifying the dominance of Christianity and Western  culture more broadly across Hawai‘i. \n\nLonger versions of this story were first published serially in the Hawaiian language newspaper, *Ka Nūpepa Kū‘oko‘a* starting in May of 1894 on a weekly basis  over a few months, interrupted and continued again later that year, and sporadically in later years. In 1917, another version of the story was published serially  in the Hawaiian language newspaper, *Ke Alaka‘i o Hawai‘i*, between January and April. There is no reference to ʻNāmakaokapāo‘o’ prior to 1894 in an online  search. The key differences between the Fornander version analyzed above and the versions published in Hawaiian newspapers center on the locus and a few  characters. In the version published by *Ka Nūpepa Kū‘oko‘a*, the locus was Kula on Maui and in the *Ke Alaka‘i o Hawai‘i* version, the locus was primarily Puna  on Hawai‘i. \n\nThe most telling aspects of the backstory are the timing of the publications and the tenor of the narrative. The story of Nāmakaokapāo‘o first appeared in May  1894, a year and half after the coup that toppled the government of Hawai‘i’s Head of State, Queen Lili‘uokalani, by insurrectionists in January of 1893\\. *Ka  Nūpepa Kū‘oko‘a* turned its favor from an independent Hawaiian Kingdom national consciousness to favoring the administration and political aspirations of  the post-Lili‘uokalani occupying administration in the interum and ran political sentiment favoring pro-occupying forces and pro-US goals, but also published traditional lore. \n\nIt is likely, therefore, that this story was invented post-1893 insurrection to build momentum for public support for a pro-US annexation political agenda, to  support culturicide, and to supplant the independent national consciousness of Hawaiian nationals with a depedentent US-national consciousness  accompanied by Western culture and Protestant principles and morés. \n\nThe characters of this story are archetypal in nature and represent allegorical and rhetorical principles likely for the purpose of achieving political and  rhetorical aims. Nāmakaokapāo‘o is the central character, a heroic archetype with superhuman strength who overcomes all obsticles through violent means.  All other characters represent indigenous Hawaiian archetypes or manifestations of a paternalistic view of native males as simple-minded, uninformed,  pathetic, and cowardly (as evindent in the use of place names with rather cynical allusions, like ʻuli’ \\[ʻdark,’ i.e. ignorance\\] or ʻmoa’ \\[ʻchicken,’ i.e. cowardly), compared to the brute force of an alpha-male leader. Native females are shown as insignificant (and therefore absent, with just one female character in the  story), timid, acted upon and not independent, creative agents for themselves. The violence of the story highlights the cultural war of the era. \n\nIf this story is a product of the 19th century, its creator (or collaboration of creators) was (were) very astute at traditional Hawaiian archetypal rhetorical  devices, competent in the use of cultural archetypes, ‘Ai Kapu traditions, storytelling norms, and royal lineages. It is a great skill to weave all of these aspects  into a storyline. One who possesses accumen of a large body of traditional Hawaiian lore is theoretically very capable of inventing new lore based on classical  principles of prosidy."
