  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nThe aunt of 'Ama'u, in the state of being in the many words that are not the words of the kumamāwalu, and she goes to the area of Ewa, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o. The aunt and her people are in the area of Ewa, and Nāmakaokapāo‘o is in the area of O‘ahu, and the people are in the land of O‘ahu.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is a complex narrative from a Hawaiian historical or oral tradition, likely from a text such as *Māui and the Māui People* or a similar ethnographic record. It reflects the interplay of kinship, geography, and cultural practices in Hawaiian society. Below is a detailed breakdown:  \n\n### **Cultural Context**  \n1. **Kinship and Lineage**:  \n   - The term **\"lohe\"** (aunt) is a kinship term, emphasizing the familial or communal ties between individuals. The passage begins by identifying **\"Ama‘u\"** as a relative, suggesting a lineage or family connection. This reflects the Hawaiian emphasis on **mahina** (kinship) as a foundational social structure.  \n   - **\"Kānaka\"** (people) and **\"makuahine\"** (people) are used to denote groups, highlighting the collective identity of communities. The phrase **\"me kona po‘e kānaka\"** (\"and her people\") underscores the importance of communal belonging.  \n\n2. **Geographical and Political Significance**:  \n   - **\"Ewa\"** and **\"O‘ahu\"** are both **place names**. **Ewa** is a region on the island of **O‘ahu**, a key area in Hawaiian history. **O‘ahu** is the largest and most culturally significant island in the Hawaiian archipelago. The mention of **\"luna o ka ‘āina O‘ahu nei\"** (\"the land of O‘ahu\") references the **‘āina** (land) as a sacred and political entity, central to Hawaiian cosmology.  \n\n3. **Cultural Practices**:  \n   - **\"Kumamāwalu\"** is a term that likely refers to a **ritual or ceremony** (from **kuma** = \"to be in a state of being\" + **māwalu** = \"to be in a condition\"). This term may allude to a specific **pōhaku** (ceremony) or **mākāhia** (ritual) tied to **‘āina** (land) or **mata‘ā** (ancestors). The phrase **\"kaua he ‘umi kumamāwalu\"** (\"not the words of the kumamāwalu\") suggests a **cultural or spiritual boundary**, possibly referencing **mākāhia** (rituals) that are excluded from a particular space.  \n\n### **Historical Significance**  \n1. **Colonial and Postcolonial Context**:  \n   - The passage may reflect **Hawaiian resistance to European colonization** or the **displacement of indigenous communities**. The mention of **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (a possible place or person) and **O‘ahu** (a central island) could allude to **historical migrations** or **conflicts** during the 19th century, when Hawaiian society was disrupted by **missionary influence** and **European colonization**.  \n\n2. **Oral Tradition and Textual Preservation**:  \n   - The passage is likely from a **textualized oral tradition**, such as a **kōkō** (oral history) or **mākāhia** (ritual text). The use of **\"hiki\"** (to go) and **\"hola\"** (to go) indicates a **narrative of movement**, which is common in Hawaiian **pū** (narratives) or **mākāhia**. The structure of the passage mirrors **Hawaiian oral storytelling**, where **geographical and kinship markers** are used to establish **cultural and political boundaries**.  \n\n### **Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Syntax and Structure**:  \n   - The passage uses **complex, nested clauses** (e.g., **\"A lohe ‘o ‘Ama‘u, ho‘omākaukau ihola ia i kona  mau wa‘a kaua he ‘umi kumamāwalu\"**), which reflect **Hawaiian’s use of relative clauses** to describe **kinship, place, and state**. The phrase **\"kaua he ‘umi\"** (\"not the words\") is a **negation** that emphasizes **cultural or spiritual exclusion**.  \n\n2. **Lexical Choices**:  \n   - **\"Lohe\"** (aunt) is a **kinship term** that is **not a proper noun**, distinguishing it from **place names** like **Ewa** and **O‘ahu**.  \n   - **\"Kumamāwalu\"** is a **compound noun** (kuma + māwalu), reflecting **Hawaiian’s use of suffixes** to denote **state or condition**.  \n   - **\"Luna o ka ‘āina\"** (\"the land\") is a **cultural concept** that ties **geography** to **spirituality** and **sacredness**.  \n\n3. **Cultural Terminology**:  \n   - **\"Makuahine\"** (people) and **\"kānaka\"** (people) are **synonymous terms** that emphasize **collective identity**, a key aspect of **Hawaiian social organization**.  \n   - **\"Hō‘onoho\"** (to be in a state of being) is a **verbal noun** that describes **a condition or status**, often tied to **rituals or spiritual practices**.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis passage encapsulates **Hawaiian cultural values** through **kinship, geography, and ritual**, reflecting the **interconnectedness of personal, communal, and spiritual identity**. It is a **textualized oral tradition** that preserves **historical memory** and **cultural practices**, even in the face of **colonial disruption**. The use of **proper nouns** (e.g., **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**, **O‘ahu**) and **cultural terms** (e.g., **kumamāwalu**, **luna o ka ‘āina**) underscores the **importance of place and lineage** in Hawaiian society. The passage is a **testament to the resilience of Hawaiian cultural memory** and the **complexity of its oral traditions**.",
  "reference_translation": "When ‘Ama‘u heard about it, he prepared  eighteen of his war canoes and went over to ‘Ewa  to make war with Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When ‘Ama‘u  reached ‘Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo‘o went  to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is  how ‘Ama‘u died. All of O‘ahu fell to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Then he went and got his  mother and set her up as ruler over all of O‘ahu."
