'Ama'u and his people go to 'Ewa, and Nāmakaokapāoʻo is at the end of the line, 'aʻohe kanaka koe, and make the story of 'Ama'u. The end of the story of Oʻahu is with Nāmakaokapāoʻo, and the next day, the child goes to the place of the land, and the child is born in the land of Oʻahu.",
  "qwen3-4b-awq-40k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nThis is the story of 'Ama'u, recounting as long as the many words are not the beginning of the legend, and then the child goes to the place of 'Ewa, not with Nāmakaokapāoʻo. 'Ama'u and his people go to 'Ewa, and Nāmakaokapāoʻo is at the end of the line, 'aʻohe kanaka koe, and make the story of 'Ama'u. The end of the story of Oʻahu is with Nāmakaokapāoʻo, and the next day, the child goes to the place of the land, and the child is born in the land of Oʻahu.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a larger narrative section in the text, likely from a Hawaiian oral tradition or historical record. It recounts a legend or myth involving 'Ama'u, a figure associated with the island of Oʻahu. The text references \"kumamāwalu\" (legend) and \"makuahine\" (child), suggesting a traditional storytelling structure where a character's journey or birth is central. The mention of \"Nāmakaokapāoʻo\" (a possible name or title) and \"luna o ka 'āina Oʻahu nei\" (the land of Oʻahu) situates the story geographically and culturally. The use of \"ihola\" (to go) and \"puni a'ela\" (end) indicates the passage is part of a larger, ongoing narrative, possibly a genealogical or mythic account of a lineage or event. The text reflects the oral tradition of Hawaiian storytelling, which often includes symbolic elements and references to natural or sacred spaces.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "When 'Ama'u heard about it, he prepared eighteen of his war canoes and went over to 'Ewa to make war with Nāmakaokapāo'o. When 'Ama'u reached 'Ewa with his men, Nāmakaokapāo'o went to work killing them all sparing no one, and that is how 'Ama'u died. All of O'ahu fell to Nāmakaokapāo'o. Then he went and got his mother and set her up as ruler over all of O'ahu.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
