Puali‘i is in Pōka‘ī’s house, and they make a statement: “I make you my wife.” Pōka‘ī says: “How can you make me your wife? You were born in a small place, and your skin is not fair.” Puali‘i says: “There is no such thing, but you make me your wife, and I will go.” So Pōka‘ī is the child. Then Pōka‘ī goes with his son Puali‘i to the school of Keahumoa, and they stay.",
  "qwen3-4b-awq-40k-maui_commentary": "This passage is a traditional Hawaiian narrative that reflects the cultural, linguistic, and social dynamics of Hawaiian society. Here’s a detailed breakdown:  \n\n### **Cultural Context**  \n1. **Family and Lineage**: The text emphasizes the importance of **lineage** and **family honor**. Puali‘i is identified as the **child of Līhu‘e** (a name likely tied to a specific family or clan), and Pōka‘ī is referred to as \"the child\" (a term that could imply a familial or social relationship). The story revolves around a **marriage proposal** (Puali‘i’s statement: “I make you my wife”), which in Hawaiian culture was a significant event requiring the **consent of the family** (Pōka‘ī’s role as a guardian or relative).  \n\n2. **Social Status and Appearance**: Pōka‘ī questions Puali‘i’s legitimacy by pointing out his **physical appearance** (“your skin is not fair”), reflecting the historical emphasis on **physical and social status** in Hawaiian society. This aligns with the idea that **status was tied to lineage, wealth, and beauty**, as seen in the use of terms like *“ke keiki”* (child) and *“wahine na‘u”* (women).  \n\n3. **Community and Education**: The final line mentions **Keahumoa**, a name that could refer to a **school or teacher**, suggesting the value of **education** and **community institutions** in Hawaiian culture. The phrase *“ho‘i akula ‘o Pōka‘ī me kāna kāne me Puali‘i ā ke kula o Keahumoa, noho”* (Pōka‘ī goes with his son to the school of Keahumoa and stays) implies that **family and community** were central to socialization and cultural transmission.  \n\n### **Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Syntax and Structure**: The passage uses **complex, layered syntax** typical of Hawaiian oral traditions. For example:  \n   - *“Iā lāua e noho ana”* (Wherever they are staying) sets the scene, while *“iho maila ‘o Puali‘i”* (the one who is Puali‘i) introduces a character.  \n   - The dialogue (*“Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u”*) uses the verb *makemake* (to make, to become) in a **figurative sense**, meaning “to marry.”  \n\n2. **Lexical Choices**:  \n   - *“Kanaka maika‘i”* (child) and *“kāne”* (son) emphasize **family roles**.  \n   - *“Kāua”* (them) and *“ia”* (to) reflect the **grammatical precision** of Hawaiian, where pronouns and prepositions are tightly integrated.  \n   - The repetition of *“akula”* (child) and *“kāne”* (son) underscores the **importance of kinship** in Hawaiian social structures.  \n\n3. **Cultural Terminology**:  \n   - *“Wahine na‘u”* (women) and *“ke keiki”* (child) highlight **gender roles** and **family responsibilities**.  \n   - The phrase *“kāua”* (them) in the final line (*“e moe kāua”*) reflects the **inclusive, communal nature** of Hawaiian language, where pronouns often refer to groups rather than individuals.  \n\n### **Historical Significance**  \n1. **Oral Tradition and Storytelling**: The passage is likely from a **traditional Hawaiian narrative**, which was passed down orally. The use of **dialogue** (*“Makemake au iā ‘oe i wahine na‘u”*) and **repetition** (e.g., *“akula ‘o Pōka‘ī”)** reflects the **epic, communal storytelling** of Hawaiian culture.  \n\n2. **Social Norms**: The story reflects **historical norms** where **family approval** was critical in marriage, and **physical appearance** (e.g., skin tone) was a marker of **status**. This aligns with the **hierarchical structure** of Hawaiian society, where **lineage and beauty** were central to social standing.  \n\n3. **Education and Community**: The mention of *Keahumoa* (a school or teacher) suggests the **importance of education** in Hawaiian culture, where **community institutions** (like schools) were vital for preserving **cultural values** and **socialization**.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis passage is a **cultural artifact** that encapsulates **family, status, and community** in Hawaiian society. It illustrates the **linguistic richness** of the Hawaiian language and the **historical values** of **lineage, appearance, and education**. The narrative serves as a **cultural lens** through which to understand the **social dynamics** and **oral traditions** of Hawaiian culture.",

  "reference_translation": "The two were going about their life when Puali‘i,  a good man, arrived from inland in Līhu‘e, to go  fishing on the shore of Honouliuli. He paid a visit to  the home of Pōka‘ī and looked at her and liked  her. He said, “I’d like you to be my woman.” Pōka‘ī  replied, “How could you possibly want me? I’ve  given birth to a child and my body is ruined.”  Puali‘i said, “I don’t care about that. If you like me,  let’s sleep together.” Pōka‘ī agreed and she went  with Puali‘i, now her man, to the plains of  Keahumoa to live.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 3:**• A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;"
