  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nO Hō‘ae‘ae in the land of ‘Ewa, in the morning, the land is being worked, and the people are moving away from the land of Nāmakaokapāo‘o. Pōka‘ī is living in Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and Kauluakaha‘i is the one who is living in the land, and Pōka‘ī is living with his family, and then they are moving on.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage from Chapter 1, Paragraph 3 of the Hawaiian text reflects a narrative of migration, land stewardship, and familial relationships, rooted in the cultural and historical context of Hawaiian society. Here’s a detailed breakdown:  \n\n### **Cultural Context**  \n1. **Land as Sacred and Central**: The phrase *“ka ‘āina”* (the land) is a recurring motif in Hawaiian culture, symbolizing both a physical and spiritual connection to the environment. The mention of *“ma ‘Ewa”* (in the land of ‘Ewa) underscores the importance of specific geographic areas in Hawaiian identity. Land is not merely a resource but a living entity, and the act of working (*“moe ‘ana”*) reflects the communal responsibility of tending to it.  \n\n2. **Migration and Displacement**: The phrase *“ma laila lāua i launa kino ai me ka moe ‘ana iho ā loa‘a ‘o Nāmakaokapāo‘o”* (in the morning, the land is being worked, and the people are moving away from the land of Nāmakaokapāo‘o) suggests a historical or narrative event of relocation. This could allude to a migration or conflict, where a group (possibly a family or community) is moving from one place (*Nāmakaokapāo‘o*) to another, reflecting the fluidity of Hawaiian communities in response to environmental, social, or political pressures.  \n\n3. **Familial Bonds**: The reference to *“Pōka‘ī”* (a person) and *“Kauluakaha‘i”* (another person) highlights the importance of kinship networks. The phrase *“ho‘i akula ‘o Kauluakaha‘i i kona ‘āina”* (Kauluakaha‘i is living in the land) implies a shared or interdependent relationship, where individuals are tied to specific places and families. The use of *“me kona hāpai”* (with their family) reinforces the cultural value of family and lineage.  \n\n### **Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Nouns and Honorifics**: The text is rich in proper nouns (e.g., *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*, *Pōka‘ī*, *Kauluakaha‘i*), which are often names of real or fictional places and people. These names are not just labels but carry cultural weight, reflecting historical or mythological significance.  \n\n2. **Verb Tenses and Modality**: The use of *“hāpai”* (to live) and *“hānau”* (to move) indicates a sequence of actions. The structure *“ma kēia hānau ‘ana”* (in this moving) emphasizes the process of relocation, while *“noho ihola”* (to live with) suggests a temporary or ongoing relationship.  \n\n3. **Cultural Syntax**: The sentence is constructed in a way that mirrors the oral traditions of Hawaiian storytelling, where complex narratives are conveyed through layered, interconnected clauses. The repetition of *“me kona”* (with them) and *“iā”* (in the place of) creates a sense of continuity and shared experience.  \n\n### **Historical Significance**  \n1. **Colonial and Post-Colonial Context**: The mention of *“Nāmakaokapāo‘o”* (a place name) may reference a historical site or a fictionalized location. In Hawaiian history, land was often contested, and the movement of people (e.g., *hānau*) could reflect the impact of colonization, where traditional landholding was disrupted.  \n\n2. **Mythology and Oral Tradition**: The text may draw on Hawaiian oral traditions, where names and places are imbued with spiritual or ancestral significance. The phrase *“kona ‘āina”* (their land) suggests a deep, often spiritual, connection to the land, which is central to Hawaiian cosmology.  \n\n3. **Social Structure**: The narrative implies a hierarchical or communal structure, where individuals (e.g., *Pōka‘ī*) are tied to specific places and families. This reflects the Hawaiian concept of *‘ohana’* (family) as the foundation of social and economic life.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis passage encapsulates the interplay between land, family, and migration in Hawaiian culture. It reflects the enduring importance of *‘āina* (land) as a sacred and communal resource, the fluidity of Hawaiian communities in response to change, and the linguistic and cultural richness of Hawaiian storytelling. The use of specific names and verbs underscores the historical and mythological depth of the text, making it a window into the values and practices of Hawaiian society.",
  "reference_translation": "Hō‘ae‘ae is the place in ‘Ewa, where the two  met in person and slept together and conceived  Nāmakaokapāo‘o. When Pōka‘ī became pregnant,  Kauluakaha‘i went home to where he came from,  and Pōka‘ī throughout her pregnancy and later gave birth. When she gave birth, Pōka‘ī and her  child, Nāmakaokapāo‘o lived in poverty."
