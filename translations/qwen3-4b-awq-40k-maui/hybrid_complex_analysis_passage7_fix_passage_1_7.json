The children are many, and they go away, but they are silent in the place of Puali‘i’s making. Puali‘i says: “Yes! This is the path on my five, it is a thing of the people of this day, and the people of the next day, and the next day, they are eating and drinking, and I have eaten before, and the next day, so.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o does not repeat Puali‘i’s words, but the next day, Puali‘i’s words are the second. Puali‘i’s words are made by Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the path, on that day, Nāmakaokapāo‘o is keeping his own place for Puali‘i. This is the case: Aloha wale the making of my place, Be silent, be full, Be full, Nākukui‘aimakaokalani, Kukui‘aimakaokalani is that, My place is that, Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawaii, Be it, be it the hōhē, The people are of the ihe, The ihe is of the pahu, So it is in the case of Nāmakaokapāo‘o.",
  "qwen3-4b-awq-40k-maui_commentary": "This passage is a rich example of Hawaiian oral tradition, blending narrative, dialogue, and cultural symbolism. Here’s a detailed breakdown:  \n\n### **Cultural Context**  \n1. **Leadership and Kinship**:  \n   - **Puali‘i** and **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** are likely high-ranking figures (e.g., chiefs or ali‘i). The text references **Nākukui‘aimakaokalani** (a title of a high-ranking chief) and **Kukui‘aimakaokalani** (another title), emphasizing the hierarchical structure of Hawaiian society.  \n   - The phrase **“E he‘e lā, e he‘e ka hōhē wale”** (Be it, be it the hōhē) reflects the use of **hōhē** (a term for a chief or leader), reinforcing the authority of the speaker.  \n\n2. **Oral Tradition and Genealogy**:  \n   - The passage includes **ōlelo hou** (common sayings) and **ōlelo a Puali‘i** (words of Puali‘i), which are typical of Hawaiian genealogical or historical accounts. These phrases often serve to preserve lineage, status, and cultural values.  \n   - The mention of **“Nāmakaokai‘a ke ali‘i nui o Hawai‘i”** (Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawaii) highlights the importance of **ali‘i** (chiefs) in Hawaiian society, where leadership was both political and spiritual.  \n\n3. **Ritual and Symbolism**:  \n   - **“Kālua me ka ‘uala”** (eating and drinking) and **“E ‘ai paha, e waiho paha”** (be full, be full) suggest communal rituals or feasts, which were central to Hawaiian social and political life.  \n   - The phrase **“Aloha wale ka maka o a‘u wahi pāo‘o”** (Aloha wale the making of my place) may reference a sacred or ceremonial space, reflecting the spiritual dimension of Hawaiian culture.  \n\n---\n\n### **Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Syntax and Structure**:  \n   - The passage uses **complex clauses** (e.g., “he mea ‘o‘oki no kō po‘o i kēia lā, a moku kō po‘o, a laila...”) to convey layered meaning, typical of Hawaiian oral storytelling.  \n   - **“Kālua me ka ‘uala”** (eating and drinking) is a **compound verb**, illustrating the fluidity of Hawaiian syntax.  \n\n2. **Lexical Choices**:  \n   - **“Ko‘ilipi”** (path) and **“moku”** (people) are central to Hawaiian concepts of **pathways** (e.g., social or political paths) and **kinship**.  \n   - **“Hōhē”** (a term for a chief or leader) is used to emphasize authority, while **“ihe”** (a term for a spear or weapon) and **“pahu”** (a term for a spear) reflect the warrior culture of Hawaii.  \n\n3. **Repetition and Rhythm**:  \n   - The repetition of **“E he‘e lā...”** and **“Make nō iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o”** (So it is in the case of Nāmakaokapāo‘o) creates a **rhythmic, poetic structure**, common in Hawaiian oral traditions.  \n\n---\n\n### **Historical Significance**  \n1. **Genealogical Records**:  \n   - The passage likely originates from a **genealogical or historical text**, as it references specific individuals (e.g., **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**, **Nākukui‘aimakaokalani**) and titles (e.g., **ali‘i nui**). Such texts were often compiled by **kūpuna** (ancestors) or **mākāhia** (historians) to preserve lineage and cultural memory.  \n\n2. **Political and Social Order**:  \n   - The text reflects the **hierarchical structure** of Hawaiian society, where leaders (e.g., **Puali‘i**) and their allies (e.g., **Nāmakaokapāo‘o**) maintained order through **rituals, speech, and symbolic gestures** (e.g., **“Aloha wale”** as a greeting).  \n\n3. **Cultural Preservation**:  \n   - The use of **ōlelo hou** (common sayings) and **ōlelo a Puali‘i** (words of Puali‘i) underscores the **oral transmission of knowledge**, a key feature of Hawaiian culture. These phrases often encode **moral, spiritual, or political values**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis passage is a **synthetic example of Hawaiian oral tradition**, blending narrative, dialogue, and cultural symbolism to convey the **social, political, and spiritual dimensions** of Hawaiian society. It reflects the **importance of leadership**, **kinship**, and **oral history** in Hawaiian culture, while using **rich linguistic features** to preserve and transmit knowledge across generations. The text serves as a **cultural artifact** that highlights the **interconnectedness of language, identity, and history** in Hawaiian society.",

  "reference_translation": "Puali‘i grabbed and adze and went out to the  middle of the patches and found Nāmakaokapāo‘o  cooking four sweet potato vines on the fire. All the  children saw this and ran off and stood a long  distance away since they were so afraid of Puali‘i.  Puali‘i said to Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Hey\\! I got an  adze in my hand to cut off your head today. When  I cut your head off, I’ll cook it in the imu with  sweet potatoes and I’ll eat first, and then, it’ll be  free for others.” Nāmakaokapāo‘o paid no  attention to what Puali‘i said and Puali‘i said it  again. Puali‘i got ready to strike Nāmakaokapāo‘o  with the adze, and at that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o  prayed a prayer of death of Puali‘i. This is what he  prayed:  How sad for the eyes of my precious pāo‘o fish Heaped up and burnt Should I eat it or leave it aside?  Maybe I should leave Nākukui‘aimakaokalani  alone  It is Kukui‘aimakaokalani afterall  My good friend.  Nāmakaokai‘a is the great chief of Hawai‘i Escaping, the coward escapes  The men with spears  Spears and drums  Killed by Nāmakaokapāo‘o",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 7:**• Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
