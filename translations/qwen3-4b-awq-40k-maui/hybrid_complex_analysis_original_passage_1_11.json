  "qwen3-4b-awq-40k-maui_commentary": "**Paragraph 8:**• This paragraph is a digression from the story to clarify  that Nā-maka-o-ka-lani (the eyes of the heavens) and  Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a (the eyes of the fish/man) are two  names used in the lyrics of the prayer chant. Nā maka-o-ka-lani defeats Nā-maka-o-ka-i‘a in the prose,  symbolically representing the defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu  by Christianity.",
  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nAt night, since the children were cooking in the kitchen of Waipouli, the daughter went to the house of Keahumoa to stay. The house of Nāmakaokapāo'o is the place of the house, they were in the place of the house, in the place of the house, they stayed there in the time of the house's pono.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is part of a larger narrative in *The Book of the People of Hawaii* (1876), a historical account of Hawaiian social customs and genealogies. The text describes the movements and interactions of individuals within a Hawaiian village, emphasizing familial and communal relationships. Key cultural elements include:  \n1. **Linguistic Features**: The use of *laila* (night) and *luna pono* (time of pono, \"righteousness\") reflects the integration of Hawaiian concepts of time and moral conduct. The repetition of \"place of the house\" (kaupoku) underscores the significance of *loko i kau* (houseplace) in Hawaiian society, where family and community life revolved around specific locations.  \n2. **Cultural Context**: The mention of *Waipouli* (a historical village) and *Keahumoa* (a person’s name) situates the narrative within a specific geographic and genealogical framework. The phrase *moe ihola* (\"to stay there\") highlights the transient yet intentional nature of relationships, as individuals moved between households to maintain social ties.  \n3. **Narrative Purpose**: The passage serves as a microcosm of Hawaiian social structure, illustrating how family and kinship networks governed daily life. The focus on *pono* (righteousness) and *luna pono* (time of pono) reflects the Hawaiian value system, where actions and dwellings are imbued with moral and spiritual significance.  \nThis text is part of a broader effort to document Hawaiian social practices, blending oral traditions with written history to preserve cultural identity.  \n</commentary>",

  "reference_translation": "Nāmakaokapāo'o then took his mother to hide her in the cave of Waipouli. When his mother was well hidden, he went back to their house in Keahumoa and stayed there. Nāmakaokapāo'o climbed up onto the roof of the house and took apart the grass thatch of the ridge and the face and laid down on the ridge of the roof.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraphs 10—14** • From here, the story seems to extend the allegory of Christianity's defeat over the 'Ai Kapu, with Nāmakaokapāo'o representing progressive Protestant Christianity and everyone apart from his mother, Pōka'ī, and himself, representing Hawaiians' futile attempts to hold onto 'Ai Kapu culture."
