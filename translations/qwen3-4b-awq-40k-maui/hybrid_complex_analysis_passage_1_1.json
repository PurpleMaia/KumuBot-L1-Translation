  "reference_commentary": "• Typically, 19th-century Hawaiian literary conventions  include using a) Roman numerals for chapter  numbers and b) a chapter summary up front. Both of  these conventions follow those used in English and  Hawaiian versions of the *Holy Bible* (*Baibala  Hemolele*).  **Paragraph 1:**  • It is very common in Hawaiian storytelling to open by  disclosing:  **a)** the name of the main protagonist/s, and   sometimes a description of their (aproximate) age  and/or physique/physical attributes;  **b)** the name of the parent/s, grandparent/s,  caregiver/s of the main protagonist/s, and sometimes  a description;  **c)** the name of the place the main protagonist/s grew  up or are living in at the time the story takes place;  • The main protagonists described in the first  paragraph are:  1\\) Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o (m) (the eyes of the pāo‘o  fish): an incredibly strong, young boy, with no  comparison from Hawai‘i to Ni‘ihau for his small  stature and strength; 2\\) Ka-ulu-a-kaha‘i (m) (the inspiration of Kaha‘i (Footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1977:385): Kaha‘i: “A hero who traveled to ‘Upolu, Samoa, and brought back breadfruit to Haki-pu‘u, Oahu (according to some versions) or to Pu‘u-loa, Kohala,  Hawaii (HM 97). He was born at ‘Ī-ao, Maui. He went to Kahiki to find his father, Hema, who had lost his eyes (HM 248). See Nā-maka-o-Kaha‘i.), Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s father; a high chief of Kahiki-papa ia-lewa (Kahiki stratum in the sky, likely a foreign  country), a place in Kahiki-nu‘u (Kahiki at the summit,  a foreign country); he is a demigod;  3\\) Pō-ka-‘ī (f) (perhaps ʻnight falls upon the high  chief’): Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s mother; no further  description;  **Paragraph 2:**  • Hō-‘ae‘ae (to make smoothe) in ‘Ewa (error,  misjudgment) is where Kauluakaha‘i (m) and Pōka‘ī  (f) met, slept together, and where Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o was born. When Pō-ka-‘ī became pregnant, Ka ulu-a-kaha‘i left and returned to his home in Kahiki papa-ia-lewa. Pō-ka-‘ī was single and destitute when  she gave birth to Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  **Paragraph 3:**  • A new character is introduced, Pua-(a)li‘i  (child/descendant of a chief/chiefly line), described  as a good man, arrived from inland at Līhu‘e  (Wāhiāwā), to go fishing at Hono-uliuli (dark bay) in  ‘Ewa, somewhere in the area where Pō-ka-‘ī was  living with her baby, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o.  – In the ‘Ai Kapu era, everyone walked on land to  every destination and it was normal to call in to the  house of strangers and ask for food and water. It  was normal to receive strangers at one’s home and  provide them with food and water, and it was  considered rude to refuse generosity. This is a  custom recounted in many stories. This is likely the  reason Pua-li‘i called in at Pōka‘ī’s house and why  Pōka‘ī received Pua-li‘i in her home, where he  observed how she was living;  • Pua-li‘i falls in love with Pō-ka-‘ī and proposes a  longterm relationship. Pō-ka-‘ī expresses hesitation  due to a negative self-image, but Pua-li‘i reassures her that as long as they both like each other, the two should begin a longterm relationship and   acknowledge each other as ʻkāne’ (boyfriend,  husband, longterm lover) and ʻwahine’ (girlfriend,  wife, longterm lover). The couple relocate to Ke-ahu moa (heap of chickens) in Līhu‘e (Wāhiāwā), where  Pua-li‘i is from, to live;  • It seems the meal Pua-li‘i proposed, with the cooked  head of ulua and sweet potatoes, was a kind of ‘Ai  Kapu ritual meal perhaps solidifying/formalizing their  longterm relationship;  **Paragraph 4:**  • Pua-li‘i is a farmer with 2 long sweet potato patches  that lasted until the publication of this story. The  name of this sweet potato garden was known as *Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o*, the name of Pō-ka-‘ī’s son, and  victorious hero of the story;  • When the sweet potatoes were ready for harvest,  Pua-li‘i said that when he eats ulua fish with sweet  potatoes, cooked in the imu. The food would then be  made free for others, particularly Pō-ka-‘ī and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o after he eats.  – The emphasis on Pua-li‘i, a male and head of the  family, eating, with his woman and child being  allowed to eat separately after he was done, is a  custom of ‘Ai Kapu culture;  • Having announced the eating routine/schedule, Pua li‘i then went to Hono-uliuli (dark bay) to fish for  ulua.  – The choice of ulua to eat with the ‘uala (sweet  potato) is likely due to the similarity in the   pronunciation of the two words, signifying ʻwhat is  above, so below,’ an old and recurring esoteric  feature of Hawaiian prosidy and culture, with a  lesson that there should always be balance in life  and in human practices (above-below; left-right;  male-female). This is the essence of ʻpono’; **Paragraph 5:**  • While Pua-li‘i was away fishing, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  came with 17 other children (perhaps all boys) to the  2 sweet potato patches. The reason they came to the  patches is not stated immediately, but it appears the  reason was to play. The 17 friends of Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o seem to represent the Hawaiian people as a  whole (or perhaps a group of individuals the  storyteller thinks poorly of) allegorically and Nā maka-o-ka-pāo‘o seems to represent a progressive minded Hawaiian.  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is described at this point of the  story as very small, perhaps 2 feet tall, and that his  penis was not yet fully grown and dangling, likely  meaning he was not wearing a malo.  – The lack of a malo on a boy is descriptive of the  child being too young to wear one. In ‘Ai Kapu  culture, when boys are deemed to be physically  able for chores and work to help sustain the family,  they would go through rites to thrust them into an  age of productive work to help support the family  demonstrated by wearing a malo on a daily basis. It  was a sign of maturity (footnote: Pukui, Haertig, Lee (1972:114) “For the *keiki lewalewa*—usually shortened to *lewalewa*—was yet a “dangler.” A small boy, so young his penis dangled. As a dangler, he wore no  *malo* (loincloth) and he lived and ate with the women. For he was yet *poke‘o*, too young to join the men. ¶ When the little dangler became six or seven years old, his status  changed in one decisive ceremony. This was the *kā i mua*...”);  • The description of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o as a pre malo-wearing child contradicts the maturity and  leadership he demonstrates by his actions and  cognitive skills, where he tells his friends to destroy  the garden. The children demonstrate hesitancy and  destroy the vines and leaves of the sweet potatoes,  but do not dig out the tubers from under the ground. – This likely demonstrates a social rhetorical   commentary about or critique of the ‘Ai Kapu  culture as a whole, that it was worthy of   destruction, with its segregation of men and  women and emphasis on heirarchy, perhaps a  justification for abandoning the culture in 1819\\.  The hesitancy of the children, and their depiction in this story as indecisive and timid could be a   Protestant Christian bias (post-1820). The idea of  not pulling out the sweet potato tubers from the  ground could represent not entirely eliminating the  Hawaiian people/culture in the Christian era (not a  complete genocide) despite the biases against the  ‘Ai Kapu;"
