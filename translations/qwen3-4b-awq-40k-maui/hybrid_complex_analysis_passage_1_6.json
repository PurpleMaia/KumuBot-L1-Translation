The next day, Nāmakaokapāo‘o goes to the place of the four colors of the plant in the moon's place, it is growing. In that place, the plant is growing in the moon's place, he goes to the place, the father's side, the mother's side, and the path, he looks at the mother's side.

It reflects traditional Hawaiian practices, language, and cultural values. Here’s a detailed breakdown:  \n\n### **Cultural Context**  \n1. **Plant Symbolism**: The text references *māla ‘uala* (plants), which are central to Hawaiian culture. Plants are often imbued with spiritual or practical significance, and their colors, growth, and locations are described with reverence. The mention of \"four colors\" and \"moon's place\" (luna o kapuahi) suggests a connection to traditional ecological knowledge and possibly lunar cycles, which were significant in Hawaiian cosmology.  \n\n2. **Names and Identity**: *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*, *Pōka‘ī*, and *Puali‘i* are likely proper nouns, possibly names of individuals or deities. The use of names in a narrative implies a story or historical account, possibly from a text like *Mālama ‘Āina* (The Land of the Ancestors) or a genealogical record.  \n\n3. **Ritual or Decision-Making**: The dialogue between Pōka‘ī (\"No\") and Puali‘i (\"Yes\") suggests a decision or ritual. The phrase *“e make ai ia‘u”* (the day that he makes it) implies a ceremonial or practical action, possibly related to planting, harvesting, or spiritual practices.  \n\n4. **Lunar and Natural Cycles**: The reference to \"moon's place\" (luna o kapuahi) ties the narrative to traditional Hawaiian astronomy and the moon’s role in agriculture, navigation, and rituals.  \n\n### **Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Syntax and Structure**: The passage uses a nested, poetic structure, with clauses like *“he kanahā āhua ka nui o nā māla ‘elua”* (the main color of the three plants) emphasizing the importance of color and size in describing the plants. The dialogue (*“‘A‘ole” / “‘Ae”*) reflects the formal, respectful tone of Hawaiian speech in cultural contexts.  \n\n2. **Lexical Choices**:  \n   - *Huhuki* (counting) and *māla ‘uala* (plants) are terms tied to traditional knowledge systems.  \n   - *Kāne kōlea* (father’s side) and *makuahine* (mother’s side) reflect Hawaiian kinship terminology, emphasizing family and lineage.  \n   - *Maka* (things) and *āhua* (color) are central to Hawaiian epistemology, linking physical observations to spiritual or practical significance.  \n\n3. **Proper Nouns**: The names *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*, *Pōka‘ī*, and *Puali‘i* are likely derived from Hawaiian roots, with *-kā* (a common suffix) and *-ī* (a common ending for names).  \n\n### **Historical Significance**  \n1. **Agricultural and Spiritual Practices**: The text may reference traditional Hawaiian agricultural practices, where plants were both practical and sacred. The mention of \"four colors\" and \"moon’s place\" aligns with the *mālama ‘āina* (land management) philosophy, which integrates ecological and spiritual stewardship.  \n\n2. **Cultural Transmission**: The narrative structure (describing a person’s journey, dialogue, and decision) suggests a story meant to preserve cultural knowledge, possibly from a *kūkū* (oral tradition) or a *mākua* (teacher) passing down wisdom.  \n\n3. **Historical Context**: The use of terms like *luna o kapuahi* (moon’s place) and *māla ‘uala* (plants) reflects the influence of Hawaiian cosmology, where natural elements (moon, plants) are deeply tied to spiritual and practical life.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis passage is a vivid example of Hawaiian cultural storytelling, blending ecological knowledge, kinship terminology, and spiritual symbolism. It underscores the interconnectedness of nature, family, and tradition in Hawaiian society, reflecting a worldview where the physical and spiritual realms are inseparable. The dialogue and descriptions highlight the importance of communal decision-making and the reverence for natural resources, which are central to Hawaiian identity.",
  "reference_translation": "At that time, Nāmakaokapāo‘o was busy tearing  apart the sweet potato patches, yanking them out.  He tore apart both sweet potato patches until  there rose a mound of sweet potato leaves, forty  mounds in all from the two patches. Then  Nāmakaokapāo‘o went back and lit a fire to broil  four sweet potato vines on a fire pit. As he was  broiling the vines, wilting them, his stepfather  came back and reached him and asked   Nāmakaokapāo‘o’s mother, Pōka‘ī, and she said,  “No.” Puali‘i said, “Yes, his head and eyes as food  to go with the sweet potatoes that I’ll eat today.  So, today I will kill him.”",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 6:**  • The numbers referred to in this paragraph are  interesting and likely a riddle to solve, with esoteric  meaning: 2, 4, 40\\. Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o is a child, but  behaves like a mature adult, albeit destructive and  spiteful, but calculating. This has allegorical meaning  and likely relates to wastefulness and the need to  dismantle ‘Ai Kapu practices.  • Pua-li‘i was so enraged by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o’s  destruction of the sweet potato patches that he  threatened to eat his head (po‘o) and eyes (nā maka)  with sweet potato in place of ulua fish. The head of  the ulua or of a person likely represents the sweet  potato tuber and the eyes likely represent the sweet  potato vine cutting (maka) that is used to replant and  perpetuate the crop, symbolically, the people of the  land. This also explains the meaning of ʻmaka’ in the  name, Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o, with ʻpāo‘o’ being used  as a poetic reference to ʻpo‘o’ (head).  – Ulua was used as a substitute for human sacrifice  on the heiau in the ‘Ai Kapu culture (footnote: Pukui & Elbert (1986:369) *ulua*: “This fish was substituted for human sacrifices when the latter were not available , probably because of word magic and the meaning of *ulua 2* \\[to grow/increase; to be possessed by a god\\]. Since an *ulua* replaces a man, *ulua* also means “man, sweetheart,” especially in love songs.”). In this case,  Pua-li‘i threatens to eat the human head and eyes  of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o in place of the ulua: the  opposite of normal ‘Ai Kapu custom. This appears  to allude to Pua-li‘i’s holding on to the ‘Ai Kapu  customs, going back in time allegorically, rather  than forward in time, where humans are no longer  sacrificed in the Western culture. Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o, on the other hand, represents going forward in time, a time of progressive thinking and   abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu;  **Paragraph 7:**  • Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o was in the process of cooking 4  sweet potato vines after destroying the sweet potato  garden. It could be that the 4 vines represent the 4  primary gods of the Hawaiian people: Kāne, Kanaloa,  Kū, and Lono. Sweet potato was one of the most  important food crops that sustained the people (represented in this story by sweet potato and ulua  fish), along with taro (another representation of  humans), and this symbolically could represent the  only esoteric epistemology and lifestyle the Hawaiian  people ever knew in the ‘Ai Kapu era. Cooking the  vine and leaves renders the vegetable edible, while  also killing it, a type of ritual canibalism.  • The words of the prayer offered in chant form  (prosidy) are a type of lament by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o  for Pua-li‘i (i.e. pitying him) and a prediction that Pua li‘i would die a gruesome death despite the fact that  Pua-li‘i was the one about to attack Nā-maka-o-ka pāo‘o with an adze. The prayer essentially says that  enlightenment would consume the eater of the flesh  of men and that the customs of war and hula (i.e.  ʻpahu’) would retreat like cowards, having been killed  off by Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o. This is likely a reference  to Christian ʻenlightenment’ replacing the ‘Ai Kapu  across the Hawaiian Islands."
