How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”",
