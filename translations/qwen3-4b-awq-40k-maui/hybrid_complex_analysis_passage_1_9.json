  "raw_response": "\n\n<translation>  \nThe entire act of speaking by Nāmakaokapāo‘o was in that time when Puali‘i spoke in the pure time of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and the words of Puali‘i were spoken to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: \"Hello, you, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.\" The words of Nāmakaokapāo‘o in the speech of Puali‘i were spoken to the sea of Waipouli, the (words) of Honouliuli, the long, the long time.  \n</translation>  \n\n<commentary>  \nThis passage is a poetic and culturally rich narrative from a Hawaiian oral tradition, likely from a historical or mythological text. Here’s a breakdown of its cultural, historical, and linguistic significance:  \n\n### **Cultural Context**  \n1. **Names and Titles**:  \n   - **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** and **Puali‘i** are proper nouns, likely referring to historical or mythological figures. The name **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** may be a title or epithet, while **Puali‘i** is a personal name. These names reflect the use of **epithets** (e.g., *Nāmakaokapāo‘o*) to denote a person’s role or status, common in Hawaiian cultural narratives.  \n\n2. **“Luna pono” (Pure Time)**:  \n   - The phrase *“i luna pono o Nāmakaokapāo‘o”* (in the pure time of Nāmakaokapāo‘o) suggests a sacred or spiritually significant period. In Hawaiian culture, *pono* (righteousness, purity) is often associated with rituals, ceremonies, or moments of spiritual clarity. This implies the narrative is set during a time of moral or spiritual importance.  \n\n3. **“Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o”**:  \n   - The greeting *“Aloha ‘oe”* (hello, you) is a standard Hawaiian salutation, but the addition of *“e Nāmakaokapāo‘o”* (you, Nāmakaokapāo‘o) emphasizes the speaker’s identity. This reflects the Hawaiian practice of addressing individuals by name in formal or ceremonial contexts.  \n\n4. **“Kai o Waipouli”**:  \n   - *Kai* (sea) and *Waipouli* (a place name) likely refer to a specific geographic or spiritual location. The phrase *“kiola akula i kai o Waipouli”* (spoken to the sea of Waipouli) may symbolize a connection to nature or a sacred site, common in Hawaiian oral traditions where natural elements are imbued with spiritual meaning.  \n\n### **Historical Significance**  \n- **Oral Tradition and Storytelling**:  \n  The passage reflects the **oral storytelling** practices of Hawaiian culture, where narratives often blend literal and symbolic language. The structure of the text (e.g., *“Pane mai ke po‘o o Puali‘i iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o”*) mimics the rhythm and syntax of traditional Hawaiian *mele* (songs) or *pū‘uhonua* (historical accounts), which often use repetition and alliteration for emphasis.  \n\n- **Spiritual and Ceremonial Context**:  \n  The mention of *“luna pono”* and the reference to *“kai o Waipouli”* suggest the narrative may be tied to a **ritual or ceremony**. The act of speaking (*pule ‘ana*) and the exchange of words (*ko‘ilipi*) could represent a **sacred dialogue** between individuals, possibly in a ritual context where speech is a form of spiritual or communal connection.  \n\n### **Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Wordplay and Ambiguity**:  \n   - The phrase *“he ana ma kahakai o Honouliuli, ‘o kona loa, ‘elima mile ka loa”* (the (words) of Honouliuli, the long, the long time) uses **poetic ambiguity**. *Kahakai* (long) and *elima mile* (long time) may be a metaphor for **eternity** or **timelessness**, reflecting the Hawaiian concept of *mau* (eternity) in spiritual contexts.  \n\n2. **Syntax and Structure**:  \n   - The sentence *“Pane mai ke po‘o o Puali‘i iā Nāmakaokapāo‘o”* (the words of Puali‘i were spoken to Nāmakaokapāo‘o) uses the **dative case** (*iā*) to indicate direction, a feature common in Hawaiian grammar. The repetition of *“kona loa”* (long) and *“elima mile”* (long time) emphasizes the **duration or permanence** of the event.  \n\n3. **Cultural Terminology**:  \n   - Terms like *“ko‘ilipi”* (speech) and *“pule ‘ana”* (the act of speaking) are **semantic fields** central to Hawaiian oral traditions, often used in **ritual or ceremonial contexts**. The phrase *“ho‘ohuli aku”* (they spoke) reflects the **past tense** and **active voice**, a key aspect of Hawaiian grammar.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis passage is a **cultural and historical artifact** that encapsulates the **oral traditions, spiritual significance, and linguistic richness** of Hawaiian culture. It reflects the interplay between **personal identity**, **spiritual time**, and **natural elements**, all of which are central to Hawaiian cosmology and storytelling. The use of **epithets**, **poetic ambiguity**, and **ritual language** underscores the **cultural and spiritual depth** of the text, making it a valuable resource for understanding Hawaiian heritage.",
  "reference_translation": "When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long."
