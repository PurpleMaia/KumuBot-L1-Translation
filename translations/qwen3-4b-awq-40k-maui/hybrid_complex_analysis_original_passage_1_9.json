  "qwen3-4b-awq-40k-maui_translation": "The full measure of the work of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, in that time, the one who is Puali‘i was in the pure land of Nāmakaokapāo‘o, and the words of the ko‘i in Puali‘i, the land of the people, and the language of the people. The words of Puali‘i to Nāmakaokapāo‘o: \"Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o.\" The one who is Nāmakaokapāo‘o, in the place of Puali‘i, the place of the sea of Waipouli, the measure of the width of Honouliuli, the place of the long distance, the measure of the length.",
  "qwen3-4b-awq-40k-maui_commentary": "This passage is a poetic and ritualistic account of a meeting or interaction between two historical or symbolic figures: **Nāmakaokapāo‘o** (a name likely referring to a leader or ancestor) and **Puali‘i** (possibly a friend, ally, or rival). The text is rich in cultural, historical, and linguistic features, reflecting Hawaiian values, oral traditions, and the significance of place and identity.  \n\n### **Cultural Context**  \n1. **Greeting and Respect**: The phrase *Aloha ‘oe, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (\"Hello, you, e Nāmakaokapāo‘o\") is a formal greeting that underscores the hierarchical and relational nature of Hawaiian social interactions. *Aloha* is a central cultural value, symbolizing love, respect, and connection. The use of *e Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (a title or name) emphasizes the speaker’s authority or identity, a common feature in Hawaiian oral traditions where individuals are addressed by their titles or roles.  \n\n2. **Place and Sacredness**: The text references *luna pono* (\"pure land\") and *kai o Waipouli* (\"the sea of Waipouli\"), which are likely symbolic or geographical markers. In Hawaiian culture, *luna pono* (a term derived from *luna* [sky] and *pono* [truth, righteousness]) refers to a sacred or morally upright land, often associated with spiritual or political significance. *Waipouli* is a real place in Hawaii, but in this context, it may represent a symbolic or metaphorical space.  \n\n3. **Ritual and Oratory**: The passage is structured as a formal dialogue or recitation, typical of Hawaiian *mele* (songs or chants) or *kōhanga* (oral traditions). The phrase *moku ke po‘o* (\"the land of the people\") and *kai o Waipouli* (the sea of Waipouli) suggest a ceremonial or poetic description of the meeting’s setting, emphasizing the connection between the speakers and their environment.  \n\n4. **Historical Figures**: The names *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* and *Puali‘i* may refer to historical leaders or ancestors. *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (likely a compound name) could be a title or a personification, while *Puali‘i* might be a place or a leader. The text reflects the oral tradition of documenting interactions between leaders, a practice common in Hawaiian history.  \n\n### **Linguistic Features**  \n1. **Poetic Structure**: The passage uses a complex, nested structure to convey the meeting’s significance. The repetition of *ke po‘o* (\"the land of the people\") and *kai* (\"sea\") creates a rhythmic, almost melodic quality, typical of Hawaiian poetry.  \n\n2. **Honorable Titles**: The use of *e Nāmakaokapāo‘o* (a title or name) and *Puali‘i* (possibly a title) reflects the Hawaiian emphasis on titles and roles in social and political contexts.  \n\n3. **Metaphorical Language**: Phrases like *he ana ma kahakai o Honouliuli* (\"the measure of the width of Honouliuli\") and *‘elima mile ka loa* (\"the measure of the length\") employ metaphorical language to describe space, emphasizing the vastness or significance of the meeting’s location.  \n\n4. **Cultural Concepts**: Terms like *ko‘i* (\"words of the ko‘i\") or *luna pono* (\"pure land\") are rooted in Hawaiian cosmology and values, linking the text to broader cultural beliefs about purity, land, and leadership.  \n\n### **Historical Significance**  \nThis passage may be part of a larger narrative or *mele* (song) that records a pivotal event in Hawaiian history, such as a political alliance, a ritual, or a conflict. The mention of *Puali‘i* and *Nāmakaokapāo‘o* suggests a historical interaction, possibly between leaders or ancestors. The reference to *Honouliuli* (a real place in Hawaii) and *Waipouli* (another real place) indicates that the text is grounded in specific geographical and cultural contexts.  \n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThis passage is a concise yet profound example of Hawaiian oral tradition, blending poetic language, cultural values, and historical references. It highlights the importance of *aloha* (respect and love), the symbolic power of place, and the hierarchical structure of Hawaiian society. The text serves as both a commemoration of a meeting and a reflection of the cultural and spiritual significance of leadership and community in Hawaiian heritage.",

  "reference_translation": "When Nāmakaokapāo‘o ended his prayer, Puali‘i  struck at Nāmakaokapāo‘o with the adze right on  top of his head, but the blade of the adze turned  towards Puali‘i and his head was cut off. From a  distance, the head of Puali‘i said to   Nāmakaokapāo‘o, “Goodbye, Nāmakaokapāo‘o.”  Nāmakaokapāo‘o took the head of Puali‘i and  threw it in the sea at Waipouli, a cave on the  beach at Honouliuli, which was five miles long.",
  "reference_commentary": "**Paragraph 9:**• While the abandonment of the ‘Ai Kapu and the rise  of Christianity are historical, Pua-li‘i’s attack of Nā- maka-o-ka-pāo‘o does not seem to have a correlating  historical reference. The ‘Ai Kapu was abandoned in  1819 and the first Christian missionaries arrived in  Hawai‘i in 1820, with a full year in the interum of no  organized religion to replace the ‘Ai Kapu. While  many Hawaiians were stubbon to adopt Christianity  and resented it, Christianity spread quickly and  overwhelmed any pro-‘Ai Kapu sentiment by the end  of the 1820s. If Pua-li‘i here represents the ‘Ai Kapu  and Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o represents Christianity, and  the adoption of Western culture in a more broad  sense, this event in the story seems to misrepresent  the ‘Ai Kapu as savage, impulsive, and violent against  Christianity, culminating in a single event. There is no  such historical single event recorded in history;  • By a twist of fate, the adze Pua-li‘i wielded to cut off  the head of Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o somehow turned  against the wielder, cutting off the head of Pua-li‘i,  which Nā-maka-o-ka-pāo‘o tossed into the ocean at Wai-pouli (water of darkness), a cave in Hono-uliuli  (bay of darkness) in ‘Ewa, O‘ahu, a distance of five   miles away. This ironic demise of Pua-li‘i signifies the  ultimate defeat of the ‘Ai Kapu by Christianity and/or  progressive ambitions, but this violent event has no  parallel in Hawaiian history. This could be viewed as  an embellishment as a type of Christian progaganda.  • The five-mile long toss of Pua-li‘i’s head by  Nāmakaokapāo‘o was an emphasis on the boy’s  superhuman physical strength."
