  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo.",

In the case of the children's being here, they are singing the language in the high, and they are going to the house of Halauoloolo; from the back of the (something) in the sea, the language is the high, and the (something) is going there for the learning of the house, of Halauoloolo.\n</translation>"
