  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki.",

On Kauai, Hina, a child is born to Laukiamanuikahiki. From Kuaihelani, Makiioeoe comes, and Hina is born in Kauai, a child; and the people are happy. At that time, Makiioeoe goes to Kuaihelani, and says to Hina: \"Yes, I am coming; you live and have a male child, take the name of the father; and if you have a female child, take the name of the mother. When you are born, you must go and visit me, and I will give you a lei, a flower, a flower, a large flower, a small flower, a large person, a small person, a large flower, a small flower, a large flower, a small flower, a large person, a small person.\" Makiioeoe returns to Kuaihelani, with the words in the name of the chief's daughter, and with the things that are all of the things of Laukiamanuikahiki, the things that are sacred, and the things that are not, are the things of Laukiamanuikahiki.\n</translation>"
