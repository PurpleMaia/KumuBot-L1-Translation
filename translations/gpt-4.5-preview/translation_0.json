  "gpt-4.5-preview_translation": "<translation>\nIn this legend, it is said that Kana's body was extremely long, large, and terrifying to behold. As he was raised, his body stretched out in length, and likewise, his house, Halauoloolo, also extended. His body stretched from the mountain nearly to the sea, and similarly, the house Halauoloolo was built to match this length.\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo."
