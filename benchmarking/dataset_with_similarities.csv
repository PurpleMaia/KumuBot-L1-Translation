While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo.","By this description, it is said that the body of Kana was a very slender body, and a large and very flexible body to look at. When he was a child, his body was like a lei, and his house of Halauoloolo was also like a lei; from the mountain to the sea, his body was like a lei, and the appearance of the house, Halauoloolo, was the same.","In this legend, it is said that the body of Kana was very long, and it was a large and awe-inspiring body to behold. As he was being raised, his body extended in length, and so did his house of Halauoloolo; his body stretched from the mountain to near the sea, and likewise, the roof of the house, Halauoloolo, extended in the same manner.","In this legend, it is said that Kana’s body was extraordinarily long—large and fearsome to behold.

His body stretched from the mountain nearly to the sea, and similarly, the house Halauoloolo was built to match this length.","tags. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, I need to read the Hawaiian text carefully. It's about Kana, describing his body as very tall and large, and his house Halauoloolo. The text mentions that his body was so tall it reached from the mountain to the sea, and the house was similarly tall.

I should break down the translation step by step. I'll start by parsing each sentence. ""Ma keia kaao ana"" seems to be introducing the story. Then ""ua olelo ia ke kino o Kana"" translates to ""it is said that Kana's body..."" The adjectives ""loihi loa"" mean very tall, and ""nui a weliweli ke nana aku"" would be ""large and terrifying to look upon.""

Next, ""I kona hanai ia ana"" refers to his height during his upbringing. ""Ua panee kona kino i ka loihi"" means his body was tall. Then, ""a ua panee no hoi kona hale o Halauoloolo"" adds that his house was also tall. The last part describes the extent of his height: from the mountain to the sea, and similarly for the house.

I need to ensure the translation is accurate and maintains the poetic feel of the original text. Also, I should use the correct grammatical structure in English to convey the same meaning without making it sound too literal.

After translating each part, I'll compile the sentences into a coherent paragraph and wrap it with the specified tags. I should double-check for any possible errors or awkward phrasing to make sure the translation is smooth and understandable.

Finally, I'll present the translation as per the user's instructions, making sure it's properly formatted and enclosed within the <translation> tags.

<translation>In this story, it is said that Kana's body was very tall, a large and terrifying sight to behold. During his upbringing, his body was so tall that it reached the heavens, and likewise, his house, Halauoloolo, was so tall that it seemed to touch the sky. From the mountain to the sea, his tall stature was like the reach of his house, Halauoloolo.","In this account it is stated that the body of Kana was long and very large and fearful to look upon. When he was being fed his body would stretch to an enormous length, and so would the house of Halauoloolo; for his body would reach from the mountain to near the sea and so on up to the building of the house of Halauoloolo.","In this way, it is the voice of Kana's children, a very heavy burden, and a great burden on the people who are taking.

While he was being raised, his body was covered in length, and his house at Halauoloolo was also covered in length; from the mountains to near the sea, his body was covered in length, and so too was the house, Halauoloolo, in its construction.","This is an account, it was said that the body of Kane (God), a very large and dangerous body, and a great body to behold.

Hmm, ""O Kalelealuaka a me Keinohoomanawanui"" – these are names, so I'll keep them as is. The next part: ""i ko laua ala ana i ke kakahiaka a hele iwaho o ka hale"" – ""ala ana"" might mean they woke up? ""Ke kakahiaka"" is morning. So maybe ""as they awoke in the morning and went outside the house."" 

Then ""iko iho la laua he pahoa e ku ana ma ka puka o ka hale, ua kukuluia."" ""Iko iho"" could be ""they found"" or ""they discovered."" ""He pahoa"" is a knife or sharp object. ""E ku ana"" is standing. ""Ma ka puka o ka hale"" at the doorway. ""Ua kukuluia"" perhaps erected or placed there. So putting it together: ""they found a knife standing at the doorway of their house, which had been placed there.""

Next sentence: ""I aku o Keinohoomanawanui ia Kalelealuaka: “Make kaua! Eia la he pahoa ma ka puka o ka hale o kaua! Ua loaa. Aloha ino kaua i ka make; o ka’u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe e waiho ke ’lii, aohe make olelo.”""

""I aku"" is ""said."" So Keinohoomanawanui is speaking to Kalelealuaka. The quote starts with ""Make kaua!"" which might be ""We are doomed!"" or ""Alas for us!"" 

""Eia la he pahoa ma ka puka o ka hale o kaua!"" – ""Here is a knife at the doorway of our house!"" 

""Ua loaa."" – ""It has arrived"" or ""It's here."" 

""Aloha ino kaua i ka make"" – ""We love death"" or maybe ""We have a great love for death""? That doesn't make sense. Maybe ""Aloha ino"" is ""extreme love"" but in context, perhaps ""We are greatly loved by death"" or ""Death loves us greatly."" Alternatively, ""Aloha ino"" could be an expression of strong feeling. Maybe ""We are doomed to die!"" 

""O ka’u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe e waiho ke ’lii, aohe make olelo."" – ""It is I who will tell you to leave the chief, no death words."" Wait, ""e waiho ke 'lii"" – ""to leave the chief""? Maybe ""to spare the chief""? ""Aohe make olelo"" – ""no death words"" or ""no words of death."" Perhaps ""I will be the one to tell you to spare the chief, there will be no death words."" Or maybe ""I will be the one to tell you to leave the chief, no more talk of death.""

Putting it all together, the dialogue seems like Keinohoomanawanui is reacting to the knife at the doorway, warning that death is near, and decides to take action regarding a chief, perhaps sparing him instead of confronting him.

I need to ensure the names are correct and the context makes sense. Maybe ""aloah ino"" is ""extreme love"" but in this context, it's more likely an expression of being doomed. ""Make"" means death, so ""Aloha ino kaua i ka make"" could be ""We are greatly loved by death"" but that's awkward. Maybe ""We are doomed to die"" is better.

The last part: ""o ka’u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe e waiho ke ’lii, aohe make olelo."" – ""It is I who will tell you to spare the chief, no more death talk."" Or ""I will be the one to tell you to leave the chief, there will be no death words.""

I think that's the gist. Now, structuring the sentences properly in English while keeping the original meaning. Let me piece it all together now.

Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, as they awoke at dawn and went outside the house, found a knife standing at the doorway of their house, which had been placed there. Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “Alas for us! Here is a knife at the doorway of our house! It has arrived. We are doomed to die; I alone will tell you to spare the chief, no more talk of death.”","Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, as they were going out in the morning and leaving the house, suddenly saw a danger standing at the door of the house, it was constructed. Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “Let us die! Here is a danger at the door of your house! It has been found. Greatly do we hate death; it is I who am telling you to abandon the chief, there will be no death spoken of.”","Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, as they went their way in the morning and left the house, found a sword standing at the door of their house, which had been placed there. Keinohoomanawanui then said to Kalelealuaka: “Let us perish! Here is the sword at the door of our house! It has arrived. We deeply love death; I must tell you to leave the chief behind—there are no words of death.”","Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, as they were going in the morning and leaving the house, saw a fire standing at the entrance of the house, which had been built. Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: 'We are dead! Here is a fire at the entrance of our house! It has been obtained. We have great affection for death; it is yours who say to leave the chief, there is no death in words.'","Regarding the sadness and despair, as they went out in the morning and beyond the house, there was a fire that was being built at the entrance of the house.  Keinohoomanawanui spoke to Kalelealuaka: “Stop! This is a fire at the entrance of your house! It’s been obtained. Don't be sad; I will tell you to leave it alone, and don’t die.”",0.8178666962088221,0.7352357217696665,0.8652186963309305,0.921374135414118,0.816046122893533,0.8364915658110287,0.8632969823162121,0.9106714774836481,0.8473667970288961,0.7883630232057834,0.8378705252738864,0.9256946164500568,0.7766877444970754,0.7430147498827037,0.8609734532319759

On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”","In the calm of their day in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went to the canoe shed, and the birds were calling, with the sound of the paddles. And when they arrived under the tree of this canoe, Kauakahi was sitting apart with the paddles. At that time, Keawenuiaumi's canoe builders were at the base of the canoe, holding the birds, calling out: ""Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There's no canoe, it's a bundle. It's a bad canoe, a bundle canoe. It's a canoe that can't go out to sea.""","On the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went to the place of the koa tree for canoe building, and the birds called out, carrying the bundle of tools. When they arrived beneath the trunk of this koa tree, Kauakahi sat apart with the bundle of tools. At that time, the canoe builders of Keawenuiaumi cut the trunk of the koa, and the birds perched, calling out: “Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, it is a hollow log. A bad canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that cannot reach the ocean.”","On the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went up to the koa tree for canoe building, guided by the calls of the birds, carrying the ‘ie container on a pole. When they reached the base of that koa tree, Kauakahi remained apart with the ‘ie container. At that time, Keawenuiaumi’s canoe carvers cut the trunk of the koa. The birds landed and cried out, “Hey, Keawenuiaumi! That’s no canoe—it’s defective. A bad canoe, a worthless canoe. A canoe that cannot go to sea.”","In the calm of their day in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went to the canoe shed, and the birds were calling, with the sound of the paddles. And when they arrived under the tree of this canoe, Kauakahi was sitting apart with the paddles. At that time, Keawenuiaumi's canoe builders were at the base of the canoe, holding the birds, calling out: ""Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There's no canoe, it's a bundle. It's a bad canoe, a bundle canoe. It's a canoe that can't go out to sea.""","On the second day of their journey in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele climbed to a place of the canoe, and the birds were calling, with the sound of the canoe's paddle. When they reached the base of that tree, Kauakahi was sitting apart with the paddle. At that time, Keawenuiaumi's canoe was stuck at the base of the tree, and the birds were perched, calling out: ""Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, it is stuck. It is a bad canoe, a stuck canoe. It cannot go to the sea.""","On their second day in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele climbed up to the place of the canoe koa tree, where the birds called out, carrying with them the basket of fish. When they arrived directly beneath the koa tree, Kauakahi sat apart with the basket of fish. At that moment, the canoe carvers of Keawenuiaumi began cutting down the koa tree, and the birds perched above called out: ""Oh, Keawenuiaumi! This is no canoe, it is hollow. A bad canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that cannot sail upon the ocean.""","tags. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, I need to read the Hawaiian text carefully. It seems like a narrative, possibly from a story or a historical account. The names like Keawenuiaumi and Mainele suggest it might be a traditional Hawaiian name, so I should be cautious with the spelling and any possible diacritics.

I'll start by breaking down the text into smaller parts to make translation easier. The first part is ""I ka lua o ka la o lakou ma Hilo,"" which I think translates to ""In the afternoon of their day in Hilo."" That makes sense as it sets the scene.

Next, ""pii o Keawenuiaumi me Mainele i kahi o ke koa waa,"" seems to involve Keawenuiaumi and Mainele going to a canoe shed. The word ""pii"" might mean to go or enter, and ""koa waa"" is likely a canoe shed. So, ""they entered a canoe shed.""

Then, ""a na manu e hea ai, me ka auamo ia o ka hokeo ie."" This part is a bit tricky. ""Na manu e hea ai"" could mean ""where the birds are heard,"" and ""me ka auamo ia o ka hokeo ie"" might refer to the sound of the canoe's prow. So, ""where the birds were heard, with the sound of the canoe's prow.""

Moving on, ""A hiki pono lakou malalo o ke kumu o ua koa nei, noho kaawale aku la o Kauakahi me ka hokeo ie."" This seems to describe them going under a koa tree, and Kauakahi sitting separately with the canoe's prow. So, ""They arrived properly under the trunk of that koa, and Kauakahi sat apart with the canoe's prow.""

The next part is ""Ia wa, ooki na kalai waa a Keawenuiaumi i ke kumu o ke koa, kau ana na manu, kahea ana: 'E, Keawenuiaumi e! Aohe waa, he puha. He waa ino, he waa puha. He waa hiki ole i ka moana.'"" This seems to be Keawenuiaumi carving the canoe while birds perch, calling out to him. The dialogue translates to ""There's no canoe, it's a mistake. It's a bad canoe, a useless canoe. A canoe that cannot go in the ocean.""

I need to ensure the translation is accurate and maintains the narrative flow. Also, I should check for any cultural nuances that might affect the translation. For example, ""koa"" is a type of tree, so it's important to keep that specific term.

I should also consider the structure of the sentences to make the English version read smoothly. Maybe using commas to separate clauses where necessary and ensuring proper punctuation.

Finally, I'll wrap the entire translation in the <translation> tags as the user requested. I should double-check the translation for any errors or awkward phrasing to make sure it's clear and accurate.

<translation>In the afternoon of their day in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele entered a canoe shed, where the birds were heard, with the sound of the canoe's prow. They arrived properly under the trunk of that koa, and Kauakahi sat apart with the canoe's prow. At that time, Keawenuiaumi was carving the canoe by the trunk of the koa, with the birds perched, calling out: ""E, Keawenuiaumi! There's no canoe, it's a mistake. It's a bad canoe, a useless canoe. A canoe that cannot go in the ocean.""","On the second day of the sun they reached Hilo, where Keawenuiaumi and Mainele hired a canoe of the people, and a man to steer it, with the understanding that they were to be taken to the foot of the koa tree. When they arrived at the foot of the tree, Kauakahi and the hokeo ie were set apart from the rest of the company. At this time the canoe builders of Keawenuiaumi began to cut down the koa tree. After the tree was cut down the men climbed up and fastened the ropes around it, and then called out: “O, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, only a raft. This is a bad kind of a canoe, a raft. This kind of a canoe cannot live on the ocean.”","At the second of the sun's path in Hilo, and Keawenuiaumi and Mainele in a place of the brave boat, and the bird where to go, with the oar of the canoe. It is proper for their descendants of the brave ones, by the oar of Kauakahi and the canoe. At that time, they cut the oar by Keawenuiaumi in the place of the brave. Then the bird says: ""O, Keawenuiaumi! There is no boat, it's a puha. It's an ino boat, it's a puha boat. It's a small boat in the ocean.""","In the afternoon of their day in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went to the place of the canoe builders, and the birds were crying, with the sound of the adze accompanying the hewing. And when they arrived under the tree of that canoe, Kauakahi was sitting alone with the adze. At that time, the canoe builders of Keawenuiaumi were at the base of the canoe, the birds perched, calling out: “Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, it's a bundle of rubbish. It's a bad canoe, a useless canoe. It's a canoe that cannot go out to sea.”",,,"On the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele climbed onto a part of the koa canoe, accompanied by the birds that guided them, along with the support of the hokeo ie. They arrived beneath the base of that tree, and Kauakahi separated from the hokeo ie. At that time, the canoe builders of Keawenuiaumi gathered at the base of the tree, placed the birds, and called out: “O Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, only a dugout. A bad canoe, a mere dugout. A canoe that cannot sail the ocean.”","On the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele ascended to the place of the canoe warrior (likely a heiau or sacred site associated with canoes and warfare), where birds were calling, accompanied by the carrying of the ie (barkcloth) bundle. They arrived properly beneath the base of that warrior canoe, and Kauakahi separated himself with the ie bundle. At that time, Keawenuiaumi’s canoe builders began work on the base of the canoe, placing [something - possibly offerings] and calling out: “Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe [suitable], it is flawed. It is a bad canoe, a flawed canoe. A canoe that cannot go to sea.”","On the day they were in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went down to a part of the koa (warrior) canoe, along with the birds that guided the way, and the crossbar of the ie's guidance. They arrived safely beneath the base of that koa canoe, and Kauakahi remained there with the guidance of the ie. At that time, Keawenuiaumi's canoe builders approached the base of the koa canoe. The birds positioned themselves and called out: ""E, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe; it is a bubble. A bad canoe, a bubble canoe. A canoe that cannot reach the ocean.""","In the middle of the day, they were in Hilo. Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went to a tree where the birds were heard, with the noise of the hokeo bird. And they arrived successfully at the base of that tree. Kauakahi sat alone with the hokeo bird. At that time, Keawenuiaumi's boat builders were many at the base of the tree. The birds perched and called out: ""Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no boat, it is a rotten log. It is a bad boat, it is a rotten boat. It cannot go to the sea.""","On the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele saw a group of dark-colored birds, and they wondered where they would find food. They had to go below the source of that old battle, and Kauakahi remained alone with his longing. That day, the dark birds of Keawenuiaumi went to the source of the battle, and they called out: “Keawenuiaumi! There is no color, it’s just emptiness. It's a terrible color, it’s just emptiness. It’s a color that cannot reach the sea.”",0.9353954356082781,0.7985551068058616,0.9325043247608821,0.9594021107778452,0.9065023566419138,0.8914175237299496,0.9124721628624295,0.9557923005718533,0.9065023566419138,0.7196198608798692,0.9165568870430386,0.9523971116805732,0.8971150573251141,0.85794550295836,0.9125076001354466

The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu.","At the time of twilight, the spirit of Pumaia again approached the woman. This was the reason he was able to come. The mother looked at her daughter and said, ""You, our child, are the beloved of the people with red blood, not of those without red blood, the people of no importance."" Pumaia said, ""What are you two whispering about?"" ""Nothing, we were just talking about death, and that you are not of the people without red blood."" Then Pumaia said to the woman, ""Let us go; I will take you and carry you."" They set out from Pukoula and passed by the spring of Pauoa, and went on until they reached the water of Alekoki, at Maemae, where they rested and spent the night, and at dawn they continued on and reached Nuuanu.","In the middle of the night, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. However, this was the reason for its return. The mother looked at the daughter and said: ""U, we are indeed the beloved of the same blood, not of your father who is not of the same blood."" Pumaia said: ""What are you two whispering about?"" ""Nothing, we are just talking about death, not about you who are not of the same blood."" Pumaia said to the woman: ""Let us go; release me and take me with you."" They ascended from Pukoula to the ridge of Pauoa, traveling until they reached the waters of Alekoki, from there to Maemae, and thus they climbed until the break of dawn, reaching Nuuanu.","On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again appeared to the woman. This is why he was able to come: The mother looked at the daughter and said, “Oh, we two are truly bound by the same blood, unlike your father who does not share our lineage.” Then Pumaia said, “What are you two whispering about?” They replied, “It is nothing; we were only talking about death—that you are not of the same blood.” Pumaia then said to the woman, “Let us go; set me free and take me with you.” So they traveled uphill from Pukoula to the crossing at Pauoa, continued on until they reached the waters of Alekoki, and from there on to Maemae. Thus they climbed, and at the first light of early morning, they arrived at Nuuanu.","In the night, the spirit of Pumaia visited the woman again. This was the reason it was able to come.

Pumaia said, ""What are you two whispering about?"" ""Nothing, we're just talking about death, not of the bloodless ones.""

That's where they climbed up and at dawn, they arrived at Nuuanu.","In the depths of the night, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. However, this is the reason it was possible. The mother looked at the daughter and replied: “Oh, our beloved one of the bloodline, you are not of the bloodline of your father who has no bloodline.” Pumaia asked: “What is the matter that you are murmuring?” “No, we are merely talking about death, you are not of the bloodline.” Pumaia said to the woman: “Let us go; release me and let us go together.” They ascended from Pukoula to the ridge of Pauoa, traveling until they reached the waters of Alekoki, and from there to Maemae, thus they ascended to the bright sea of the great morning, reaching Nuuanu.","On the second night, Pumaia's spirit again appeared to the woman. However, there was a reason for his return. The mother looked at her daughter and said: ""Indeed, you and I share the bond of blood kinship, unlike your father who is not of our blood."" Pumaia asked: ""What are you two whispering about?"" ""Nothing, we were merely speaking about death, and how you are not of impure blood."" Pumaia then said to the woman: ""Let us go; release me and take me along."" They ascended from Pukoula to the uplands of Pauoa, traveling until they reached the waters of Alekoki, and from there to Maemae.

The mother looks at the daughter and speaks: ""Ah, we are the beloved ones of the blood, not your father who is without blood."" Pumaia asks, ""Why are you two scheming?"" The woman replies, ""No, we are""","In the second watch of the night, the spirit of Pumaia again possessed the woman. This is how it happened. The mother saw that the daughter was in a trance and she spoke to her: “O, our dear one, the life blood of our family, do not forget that your father is without the life blood of the family.” Pumaia replied: “What are you two murmuring about?” The mother replied: “We are only talking about our death, for without you our lives would be of no value.” Pumaia then said to the woman: “Let us go; I will be killed and we will die together.” They then ascended the mountain Pukoula to the temple of Pauoa, where they stayed until the water of Alekoki was reached, and from there to Maemae, where they again ascended to the summit of the Kaiaka sea in the early morning of the third day, arriving at Nuuanu.","In the night of the moon, the soul of Pumaia is free to the woman. Indeed, the teacher is to be released. She went to the child and said: ""O, your love for the whole world, you are not the child of the whole world."" He said: ""What is your name?"" ""Not, only a thing to be taken in the night, I am not the whole world."" She said to the woman: ""Let's go; take me and speak."" They went from Pukoula to the house of Pauoa, go and reach the water of Alekoki, then to the place of Maemae, like them in the direction of the great day's sea, they reach Nuuanu.","In the night, the spirit of Pumaia visited the woman again. This was the reason it was able to visit. The mother looked at the daughter and said: ""You, we are the beloved of the blood relatives, not of the unrelated blood relatives.""

Then Pumaia said to the woman: ""Let's go; separate from them and take me."" They set out from Pukoula to the ridge of Pauoa, went along, and reached the water of Alekoki, where they found Maemae. That's where they set out to sea at early dawn, and when they arrived at Nuuanu.",,,"In the depth of night, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. Here is the reason it happened. Then the mother addressed her daughter and said: “Ah, our lineage is the beloved bloodline, not our father’s non-bloodline.” Pumaia responded: “Why are you two arguing?” “No, we are merely speaking; we are not of the non-bloodline,” the woman replied. Pumaia then said to the woman: “Let us go; separate me and take me along.” They climbed down from Pukoula and proceeded toward the fern grove of Pauoa, journeying until they reached the waters of Alekoki. From there, guided by Maemae, they climbed onward, emerging at dawn’s misty light, and arrived at Nuʻuanu.","In the second watch of the night, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. But this was the reason for its return. The mother looked at her daughter and replied: “Yes, it is yours, the beloved of the bloodline, not your father’s who has no blood connection.” Pumaia said: “What are you two whispering about?” “No, we were just lamenting the death; you do not have a blood connection.” Pumaia said to the woman: “Let us go; open the way for me and take [it] along.” They ascended from Pukoula to the cliff of Pauoa, traveling until they reached the waters of Alekoki; from there to Maemae, and thus they climbed until at dawn’s early light, they arrived at Nuuanu.","In the depth of darkness, the spirit of Pumaia returns to the woman. Here is the reason why it happened. The mother spoke to her daughter and said: “Oh, our return is because we are of the beloved bloodline, not your father’s bloodline, which is not of blood.” Then Pumaia asked: “What are you two arguing about?” “No,” the woman replied, “it is just that we will die; you are not of the bloodless line.” Pumaia then said to the woman: “Let’s go; separate me and take me along.” They went down from Pukoula and the valley of Pauoa, proceeding toward the waters of Alekoki, then to Maemae, following the path to the dawn tide of the great morning, and arrived at Nuʻuanu.","At midnight, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. Here is the reason. The mother looked at the daughter and replied: “Yes, we are the return of the beloved of the flesh and blood, not the beloved of the flesh and blood of your father.” Pumaia said: “What is the matter with you two?” “No, we are just talking about death, not about you, the one not of flesh and blood.” Pumaia said to the woman: “Let us go; separate from me and take it.” They went from Pukoula to the slope of Pauoa and then to the water of Alekoki, and then to Maemae, and they walked until the vast sea was visible at dawn, and they reached Nuuanu.","At nightfall, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. However, the reason for this return was revealed. The mother took the girl and replied, “You, you are not the child of the red earth, it is not your father of the red earth.” Then Pumaia asked, ""What illness troubles you?""

His canoe is large, mine is small; his is long, mine short; his crew are men of stature, mine are little men; that is the kind of person that is coming, but this girl is of low degree.” They again listened to the conversation between the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki. The owl said: “We will go and tell the chief to take care of this girl.” One of them said: “Yes.” They then went to the chief Makiioeoe and woke him up about dawn and said: “Here she is, wake up.” “What is it?” asked Makiioeoe. “A owl; the girl you are in search of is on the neck of the pig that is tied up.

They approached Chief Makiioeoe, who was asleep, and woke him: “Hey there, wake up!” “What?” said Makiioeoe. “An owl—it is perched atop the post where the girl is bound.

Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home.

First, I'll look at the structure of the text. It seems to be a list with each line starting with a number and then some Hawaiian words. My initial thought is that this might be a traditional Hawaiian chant or a counting rhyme, possibly related to parts of a canoe or natural elements.

I'll break down each line to translate accurately. The first line, ""He aina hau kinikini o Kohala,"" translates to ""A land with a leathery hau tree of Kohala."" I know that ""hau"" is a type of tree, and ""Kohala"" is a place name on the Big Island. ""Hau kinikini"" might refer to the texture of the tree's wood, so ""leathery"" makes sense here.

Next, each subsequent line starts with a number and a word. I recognize that these could be parts of a canoe. For example, ""ke ama"" is the outrigger, ""ka iako"" is the crossbeam, ""ka ilihau"" is the bow, ""ka laau"" is the hull, ""ke opu"" is the stern, and ""ka nanana"" might be the seats. The last line mentions ""hau i ka mauna,"" which could mean the hau tree on the mountain.

I need to ensure that each term is correctly translated, especially the parts of the canoe, as they have specific names. I'll also check if ""nanana"" is correctly translated as ""seats"" or if it refers to something else. Maybe it's the lashings or the deck, but I'll go with seats for now.

Putting it all together, the translation should maintain the poetic structure, so I'll keep each line as is but in English. I'll make sure to wrap the final translation in the specified tags as the user requested.

I should also consider if the user is looking for a literal translation or if they need a more interpretative one. Since they didn't specify, I'll aim for accuracy while keeping the poetic feel. Additionally, I'll make sure the formatting is clean and each line is properly separated for readability.

Finally, I'll review the translation to ensure there are no errors and that each term is correctly translated. This way, the user gets an accurate and well-formatted response as they requested.

Make sure all parts are included and the flow is logical. Also, check for any possible errors in parsing the sentences. For example, ""he wahi iki koe puni loa ua pa nei i ka iwi kanaka"" – ""a small place that completely surrounds the breaking of human bones"" might be better as ""a small place where many people's bones were broken"" or ""a place renowned for the breaking of human bones."" 

Alright, time to put it all into English with the tags.
