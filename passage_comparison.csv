In this search he went to their home, where he learned that Aukelenuiaiku had not returned. He then took up the loin cloth of his brother, and wore it round his neck and wept.

Because you have been given to me to be killed and that I should devour you, but since I have found out that you are one of those that have gone out of my own body, I cannot eat you up.” When the lizard concluded, Aukelenuiaiku gave his consent, for he thought within himself that the request of his lizard grandmother, Kamooinanea, should be granted. He then gave one of the men to the lizard. As soon as the man was offered, he was swallowed whole. After this first man was consumed the lizard again asked that the second man be given her.
