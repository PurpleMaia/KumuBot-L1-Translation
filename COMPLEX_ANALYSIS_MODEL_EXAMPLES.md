## Summary Interpretations - Direct Quotes

### DeepSeek R1 (Correct Identification of Colonial Propaganda)

> "This story first appeared in *Ka Nūpepa Kū'oko'a* in 1894 during the crucial period following the U.S. overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom (January 1893). The paper, once a bastion of nationalist Hawaiian identity, shifted support towards the occupying Provisional Government."

> "Therefore, this chapter functions allegorically on multiple levels... It justifies the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom by depicting the violent removal of indigenous authority figures as necessary and divinely sanctioned liberation from oppressive systems ('Ai Kapu), subtly promoting Western cultural models."

### Qwen3-235B (Inverted Interpretation - Resistance)

> "The narrative can be read as a form of indigenous epistemic resistance, asserting Hawaiian ways of knowing and being in the face of colonial encroachment."

> "Functions simultaneously as cultural preservation and encoded resistance to dominant Western narratives that sought to erase or marginalize indigenous Hawaiian perspectives."

### DeepSeek V3 (Counter-Colonial Reading)

> "The narrative of a small-bodied hero overthrowing oppressive and larger forces serves as a potent counter-colonial allegory."

> "This ambiguity—between capitulation to colonial narratives and recalibration of indigenous heroism—constitutes the abiding legacy."

### Llama4-Maverick (No Political Awareness)

> "The narrative serves as a powerful exploration of traditional Hawaiian values, genealogical significance, and the transformative power of supernatural intervention."

> "This chapter exemplifies the rich tradition of Hawaiian mo'olelo, preserving cultural knowledge and values through narrative."

### O4-Mini (Resistance but Recognizes Context)

> "Though likely composed in the post-coup environment of the 1890s... the story's focus on rightful versus usurped authority can be read as an allegorical critique of illegitimate rule."

> "The narrative may have functioned to reaffirm indigenous concepts of chiefly order, in opposition to colonial interventions."

## Commentary Examples - Key Passages

## Conclusion

These examples demonstrate how the same text can be interpreted in dramatically different ways. The critical difference lies not in translation accuracy but in:

1. Historical awareness (1893 overthrow context)
2. Understanding of publication venue politics
3. Recognition of allegorical possibilities
4. Critical stance toward narrative authenticity

Only DeepSeek R1 combined all these elements to reach the reference interpretation that the story may function as post-1893 propaganda justifying the overthrow of Hawaiian sovereignty.
