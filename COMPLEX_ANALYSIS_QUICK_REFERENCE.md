| 3 | Kimi-K2 | 95.5% | Exceptional | ‚ùå Sophisticated Resistance | Deep colonial awareness but interprets as anti-colonial palimpsest |
| 4 | Qwen3-235B | 95%+ | Exceptional | ‚ùå Resistance Narrative | Recognizes colonial context but inverts meaning |
| 5 | DeepSeek V3 | 95%+ | Strong | ‚ùå Counter-Colonial | Good awareness but wrong interpretation |
| 6 | Llama4-Maverick | 96.4% | Detailed | ‚ùå Traditional Hero | Highest translation score but zero political awareness |
| 7 | O4-Mini | 95%+ | Solid | ‚ùå Indigenous Resistance | Sees colonial parallel but inverts allegory |

## The Critical Test: What Does the Story Represent?

### ‚úÖ Correct Interpretation (Reference)
- Story invented post-1893 as propaganda
- Justifies overthrow of Hawaiian Kingdom  
- NƒÅmakaokapƒÅo'o = Western/colonial forces
- Puali'i/'Ama'u = Traditional Hawaiian authority

### ‚ùå Common Misinterpretation
- Story as Hawaiian resistance narrative
- NƒÅmakaokapƒÅo'o = Hawaiian people fighting colonialism
- Puali'i = Colonial oppressors

### ‚ùå Naive Reading
- Simple traditional hero story
- No political implications
- Pre-contact authentic narrative

## Key Differentiators

### üéØ What to Look For:

1. **Temporal Awareness**
   - Mentions 1894 first publication ‚úÖ
   - Notes *Ka N≈´pepa K≈´'oko'a* shift ‚úÖ
   - Recognizes post-1893 context ‚úÖ

2. **Allegorical Reading**
   - Sweet potato destruction = dismantling 'Ai Kapu
   - Violence = political overthrow
   - Gender marginalization = Victorian influence

3. **Critical Stance**
   - Questions story's authenticity
   - Recognizes potential propaganda
   - Analyzes publication timing

## Quick Model Summaries

**DeepSeek R1**: "This story likely serves as invented post-1893 pro-Western political allegory"

**GPT-4.1**: "Reflects narrative renegotiation consistent with late-19th century publications"

**Kimi-K2**: "Cultural palimpsest embedding colonial-era political agendas within mythic structure"

**Qwen3-235B**: "Functions as indigenous epistemic resistance against colonial forces"

**Llama4-Maverick**: "Exemplifies traditional Hawaiian heroic archetype and cultural values"

**O4-Mini**: "May function to reaffirm indigenous concepts against colonial interventions"

## Evaluation Insights

### Surprising Finding
Translation accuracy (93-96%) had NO correlation with interpretive insight. The highest-scoring translator (Llama4-Maverick at 96.4%) completely missed the colonial critique.

### Performance Distribution
- 5.5% (1/18) correctly identified colonial propaganda
- 33% (6/18) recognized colonial context but inverted
- 61.5% (11/18) showed no political awareness

### What This Reveals
Most LLMs excel at linguistic translation but struggle with:
- Historical context recognition
- Political subtext identification  
- Critical literary analysis
- Propaganda detection

## For Future Evaluations

### Priority Order:
1. Read summary first (reveals framework)
2. Check for 1893/1894 mentions
3. Identify allegorical interpretation
4. Assess political awareness
5. Then evaluate translation/commentary

### Red Flags:
- No mention of publication date
- Generic "resistance" narrative
- Pure linguistic focus
- Missing colonial context

## Recommended Models for Different Purposes

**For Critical Analysis**: DeepSeek R1  
**For Translation Accuracy**: Llama4-Maverick or GPT-4.1  
**For Scholarly Balance**: GPT-4.1  
**For Alternative Perspectives**: Qwen3-235B (resistance reading)

## Key Takeaway

When evaluating culturally complex Hawaiian texts, the ability to recognize potential colonial-era manipulation is more important than perfect translation. Only 1 in 18 models demonstrated this critical awareness, highlighting a significant gap in current LLM training for historical-political analysis.
